This study aimed to identify the needs and challenges of Vietnamese Technical Intern Training candidates, the largest group of foreign care workers, to facilitate program reforms and a more efficient recruitment process. A semi-structured interview survey was conducted with 27 candidates in Vietnam. Interview items included reasons for choosing the training program in Japan, the desired length of stay, expectations, and career advancement after returning home. Descriptive statistics and K-means clustering were used to analyze the data. Survey results showed that all participants independently decided to pursue care worker training in Japan; 44% had considered other countries; most wanted to stay in Japan for as long as possible; and 37% wanted to live in Japan permanently. The K-means method revealed three clusters: a Japanophile cluster (preferred Japan for its landscape, culture, and national character); a word-of-mouth cluster (influenced by personal referrals); and an intellectual cluster (influenced by Japan’s economic development and care levels). Our findings indicate that support for obtaining qualifications, Japanese language skills, and caregiving skills are important to secure the stability of foreign care workers. It is necessary to tailor recruitment, training, and support for each cluster. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Foreign Care Workers; Japan; K-means; Long-term Care; System Sustainability; Economic Development; Health Care; Occupational Exposure; Questionnaire Survey; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; Training; Japan; Viet Nam,economic development; health care; occupational exposure; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; training; Japan; Viet Nam,,,"This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI, grant number JP 20 K 18850, and the K.

Despite the worldwide genetic, cultural, and environmental variations in determinants of CVDs, few studies have attempted the identification of risk factors of CVDs in low- and middle-income countries. This article aims to introduce the Khánh Hòa Cardiovascular Study, a prospective cohort study among middle-aged community dwellers in rural Khánh Hòa, Vietnam. A total of 3000 individuals, aged 40–60 years at baseline, participated in the baseline survey conducted from June 2019 to June 2020 and will be followed up for the subsequent 10 years. The baseline survey collected information on sociodemographic variables, disease history, lifestyle, social environment, and mental health via questionnaires, physical examinations, and biochemical measurements. Information on the incidence of severe health outcomes (i.e., mortality, CVDs, and cancer) has been and will be collected using a study-specific disease registry. Results showed that the prevalences of excess body weight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were 25.9%, 39.6%, 10.2%, and 45.1%, respectively. Furthermore, by March 2023, 21 participants had died, including 5 CVD deaths and 12 cancer deaths. Moreover, we recorded 22 and 31 cases of nonfatal CVDs and cancer, respectively. These results suggest that many rural residents in Vietnam have high cardiometabolic risk, and underscore the importance of advancing research to identify risk factors and prevent the onset of serious health events. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",C Reactive Protein; C Reactive Protein; High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Triacylglycerol; Adult; Article; Body Mass; Body Weight; Cardiovascular Disease; Cardiovascular Risk; Cohort Analysis; Community; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Burden; Dyslipidemia; Female; Follow Up; Health Care Survey; Human; Human Experiment; Hypertension; Male; Malnutrition; Mental Health; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Middle Income Country; Obesity; Physical Activity; Prospective Study; Questionnaire; Risk Factor; Social Determinants Of Health; Sociodemographics; Epidemiology; Independent Living; Prevalence; Rural Population; Viet Nam; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Dyslipidemias; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Independent Living; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Vietnam,C reactive protein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; community; diabetes mellitus; disease burden; dyslipidemia; female; follow up; health care survey; human; human experiment; hypertension; male; malnutrition; mental health; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; middle income country; obesity; physical activity; prospective study; questionnaire; risk factor; social determinants of health; sociodemographics; epidemiology; independent living; prevalence; rural population; Viet Nam; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Dyslipidemias; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Independent Living; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Vietnam,,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4","This work was supported by The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (19A06, 22A02 awarded to YI), The Pfizer Health Research Foundation (awarded to YI), and The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKANHI) (JP19K20536, JP23H03638 awarded to YI, JP21J01171 awarded to Aki Yazawa, JP21K17301 awarded to Dong Van Hoang).

Leveraging the variation in the degree of ICT development among provinces as a source of exogenous variation, we employ fixed effects models. Our findings provide evidence that ICT improves the chances of obtaining contracted jobs for married women, particularly those who are low-educated, belong to minor ethnic groups, and are relatively older individuals aged 40 to 55. The rise in contract jobs for these groups suggests that ICT development has improved the local labor market and enhanced the job-matching process for vulnerable women in Vietnam. Additionally, we explore the well-being of households led by married women in contractual employment, revealing a positive correlation between the ICT development and average daily caloric intake per capita in such households. Our pathway emphasizes the synergy of ICT deployment, expanded contractual opportunities, and improved caloric intake. Furthermore, the results indicate a reduction in working hours for married women in contractual positions as a result of ICT development, suggesting ICT’s role in enhancing time management and work efficiency, thereby positively impacting household well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Contract Job; Female Employment; Ict; Vhlss; Vietnam; Correlation; Ethnic Minority; Information And Communication Technology; Labor Market; Quality Of Life; Womens Employment; Viet Nam,correlation; ethnic minority; information and communication technology; labor market; quality of life; womens employment; Viet Nam,,,"The second author received a grant for the research (JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number 18K01649).","Abbas, Khizar, Assessing an empirical relationship between energy poverty and domestic health issues: A multidimensional approach, Energy, 221, (2021); Aker, Jenny C., Dial ""A"" for agriculture: A review of information and communication technologies for agricultural extension in developing countries, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 42, 6, pp. 631-647, (2011); Appiah-Otoo, Isaac, The impact of ICT on economic growth-Comparing rich and poor countries, Telecommunications Policy, 45, 2, (2021); Simplice, Asongu Anutechia, The impact of mobile phone penetration on African inequality, International Journal of Social Economics, 42, 8, pp. 706-716, (2015); Atasoy, Hilal, The effects of broadband internet expansion on labor market outcomes, ILR Review, 66, 2, pp. 315-345, (2013); Mobile Broadband Internet Poverty and Labor Outcomes in Tanzania, (2021); Balsmeier, Benjamin, Is this time different?

This study provides empirical evidence from two ethnic minorities in Vietnam, highlighting how perceptions of livelihood resilience vary by gender, geographical context, and ethnicity, with a particular emphasis on their intersections. Over 13 months, data were gathered through 3 focus group discussions, in-depth interviews with 9 key informants, field observations, and surveys of 136 households. The findings revealed a low average Household Livelihood Resilience (HLR) score of 0.434, indicating limited resilience among forest-dependent households facing external shocks. Notably, a significant gender gap was evident, with men demonstrating higher resilience levels than women, a disparity attributed to entrenched social norms and cultural practices. Women, often confined to domestic roles, faced barriers to community involvement and access to financial resources, which weakened their ability to cope with and recover from adverse events. To address these issues, the study advocates for climate actions that prioritize gender equality and aim to enhance women's resilience. This includes amplifying their voices through tailored training programs and initiatives such as women-managed microfinance groups. The study also emphasizes the policy implications for advancing gender equality, sustainable forest management, and livelihood resilience. However, this work has limitations, including a small sample size and reliance on self-reported data, which may introduce biases. Future research should involve a larger, more diverse sample of forest-dependent communities and examine various dimensions of vulnerability to provide a more nuanced understanding of resilience factors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Forest-dependent Communities; Gender; Livelihood Resilience; Vietnam,,,,,"Amoak, Daniel, Does climate information source matter in smallholder farmers' climate resilience?

This energy poverty, particularly among the elderly, continues to affect well-being and health as the population ages. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty on the life satisfaction of elderly individuals, using data from the 2011 Vietnam National Aging Survey. As one of the first studies to explore this relationship in Vietnam, it contributes to the literature by providing valuable empirical evidence of the causal link between energy poverty and life satisfaction, shedding light on the mechanisms behind the observed effects. By adopting a multidimensional approach, we measure energy poverty across three distinct thresholds. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we employ a two-stage least squares regression, using provincial-level information and communications technology infrastructure as an instrumental variable. Our findings consistently demonstrate that energy poverty significantly and negatively impacts the life satisfaction of the elderly across all three measures. To ensure the robustness of our results, we conduct additional tests, including alternative constructions of energy poverty and the use of different instrumental variables, such as the number of Internet users per 100 population at the provincial level. We further validate our conclusions through other methods, including plausible exogenous instrumental variables and double/debiased machine learning, confirming the stability and reliability of our findings. Additionally, we identify two key pathways through which energy poverty affects life satisfaction: physical health and mental health.

In more detail, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of witnessing others’ i-deals on coworker’s emotional response (malicious envy), and the moderating effect of individualistic values on that response at both individual and national level. In addition, this study examines the impact of two types of witnessing others’ i-deals which include not only the other’s i-deals that the coworker directly observes, but also the generalized others’ i-deals which is an aggregated perception as a result of frequent observation of idiosyncratic deals enjoyed by multiple others. Data were collected from 450 employees from 5 Asian countries at two points. We adopted a hierarchical linear model (HLM) because we assume two levels for both i-deals and individualism. The results show that witnessing other’s i-deals is positively related to malicious envy. In addion, individual-level individualism was found to moderate the relationship between witnessing coworkers’ i-deals and malicious envy. Interestingly, it is not individualism at the country level, but that at the individual level that moderates the relationship between witnessing i-deals and malicious envy. This study indicates that i-deals studies on coworkers’ reactions to others’ i-deals should focus more on the moderating effect of individual cultural values. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coworker Reactions; Idiosyncratic Deals; Individualism; Malicious Envy,,,,,"Social Psychology Quarterly, (1993); Matthijs Bal, P.

This study aims to identify the opportunities to advance school disaster safety by assessing policies and practices in Vietnam. A framework adapted from the ASEAN Comprehensive School Safety Framework and School Disaster Resilience Assessment is utilized to evaluate policy coverage and implementation level of school safety in Vietnam. The study systematically reviewed legal documents at national level, followed by questionnaire surveys conducted for primary schools in Da Nang City, which was selected as a pilot evaluation site owing to its vulnerability to natural disasters and extensive records of school safety practices. Results show that the most critical elements of school safety have been reflected in existing policy documents and regulations. However, the gap between policies and implementation remains due to the inadequacy of school safety viewpoint, designated roles and responsibilities, resources, and guidelines for supporting the school safety practices at the local level. The findings emphasize the importance of a national school safety framework that enables institutional and resource arrangements for better practices at the local level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Da Nang City; Policy; Practice; School Safety; Vietnam; Asean; Assessment Method; Disaster Management; Natural Disaster; Policy Approach; Policy Implementation; Safety; Vulnerability; Da Nang; Viet Nam,ASEAN; assessment method; disaster management; natural disaster; policy approach; policy implementation; safety; vulnerability; Da Nang; Viet Nam,,,This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 507.01-2019.302 .,"Amri, Avianto, Bridging the divide between studies on disaster risk reduction education and child-centred disaster risk reduction: a critical review, Children's Geographies, 16, 3, pp. 239-251, (2018); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2015); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2024); undefined, (2023); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2024)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,25900617,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202795953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a set of indicators suitable to Vietnam’s social-ecological conditions based on the IUCN concepts of management effectiveness and the consultation dialogues with relevant BR stakeholders. This set includes 58 indicators, 20 headline indicators according to 6 management elements of BR: Context, Planning, Inputs, Process, Outputs and Outcomes. Management effectiveness value is divided into 5 levels (0, 25, 50, 75, 100) and thereafter categorised into 4 ranges according to the corresponding value (Very low: 0–25 points; Low: 25–50 points; Average: 50–75 points; High: 75–100 points) with the higher the value, the greater the effectiveness. Based on the indicators, we evaluated the management effectiveness of Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An BR (designated in 2009). The results of evaluating management effectiveness for this BR have determined that the overall management effectiveness for the whole BR is 78.2 out of 100 scores, equivalent to high management effectiveness. Results for management elements: element 1 (Context-85.8 score), element 2 (Planning-83.5 score), element 3 (Inputs-73.4 score), element 4 (Process-76.3 score), element 5 (Outputs-68.3 score) and element 6 (Outcomes-81.9 score). Although the indicators presented a useful analysis of management effectiveness in this particular case, owing the diversity of BRs in Vietnam in terms of socio-ecological conditions, total area, governance model and administration, caution should be applied in the treatment and/or selection of these indicators for all BR cases and the 58 indicators should be used as a guide for each specific BR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biosphere Reserves; Cu Lao Cham-hoi An; Evaluation; Management Effectiveness Indicators; Sustainable Development; Vietnam; Biosphere; Environmental Planning; Management Practice; Nature Reserve; Sustainable Development; Unesco; Viet Nam,biosphere; environmental planning; management practice; nature reserve; sustainable development; UNESCO; Viet Nam,,,We thank the Project \u201CResearch on the theoretical and practical basis and propose a guiding framework for management of world biosphere reserves recognized by UNESCO in Vietnam\u201D Code DTDLXH-06/21 and \u201CThe Japan Prize Heisei Memorial Grant\u201D (PI: Toshinori Tanaka) for financial and technical support to conduct this research.,"Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, (1996); German Commission for Unesco Management Manual for Unesco Biosphere Reserves in Africa A Practical Guide for Managers, (2015); Unesco Mab Technical Guidelines for Biosphere Reserves, (2021); Unesco Mab Madrid Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves, (2008); Unesco Mab Mab Strategic Action Plan 20152025, (2015); Lima Action Plan, (2016); World Network of Biosphere Reserves, (2024); Evaluating Effectiveness A Framework for Assessing the Management of Protected Areas, (2000); International Journal of Unesco Biosphere Reserves, (2017); Unesco Biosphere Reserves Supporting Biocultural Diversity Sustainability and Society, (2019)",,Springer Nature,,,,,,26629984,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202731923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also explore the joint effect of ICT efficiency and ER on LCET. Moreover, the impact mechanisms are fully explored. The findings are as follows: (1) ICT efficiency and ER both have positive impacts on LCET, which means that they have individual low-carbon technological innovation effects. (2) The interaction of ICT efficiency and ER contributes to the rise of LCET. In other words, these two factors work synergistically to promote the development of LCET. (3) Heterogeneous effect suggests that the combined promotion effect of ICT efficiency and ER on LCET is more remarkable in regions with better economic development. (4) ICT efficiency affects LCET by encouraging R&D and fiscal spending on the environment, which means that R&D and fiscal spending on the environment are two transmission mechanisms between ER and LCET.

Guided by this perspective, we examined in a multinational and multicultural study (61 countries; N = 15,039) how narcissism forms are linked to cognitions and behaviors prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As expected, differences in cognitions and behaviors across narcissism forms emerged. For example, higher narcissistic rivalry predicted lower likelihood of enactment of COVID-19 prevention behaviors, but higher narcissistic sanctity predicted higher likelihood of enactment of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Further, whereas the heroism, admiration, and rivalry narcissism forms acted in a typically antisocial manner, with high narcissism predicting greater endorsement of unfounded health beliefs, the sanctity form acted in a prosocial manner, with higher narcissism being linked to lower endorsement of unfounded COVID-19 health beliefs. Thus, the findings (a) support the idea of four narcissism forms acting differently, and (b) show that these differences reflect a double-edged sword, sometimes linking to an anti-social orientation, and sometimes linking to a pro-social orientation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adult; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Epidemiology; Female; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Narcissism; Pandemic; Psychology; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Young Adult; Adult; Covid-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Narcissism; Pandemics; Sars-cov-2; Young Adult,adult; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; female; human; male; middle aged; narcissism; pandemic; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; young adult; Adult; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Narcissism; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult,,,"The work of Magdalena \u017Bemojtel-Piotrowska and Jaros\u0142aw Piotrowski was supported by grant 2017/26/E/HS6/00282 from the National Science Centre, Poland.

This study aimed to assess the quality of life (QoL) of people living in disadvantaged coastal communes (subdivision of Vietnam) and identify their associated factors by using the World Health Organization’s quality of life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF). To achieve this, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 595 individuals aged 18 years and above living in the coastal communes in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam, from October 2022 to February 2023. The results showed that the mean overall QoL (mean ± SD) was 61.1 ± 10.8. Among the four domains of QoL, the physical health (57.2 ± 12.3) domain had a lower score than the psychological health (61.9 ± 13.0), social relations (63.4 ± 13.4), and environment (61.9 ± 13.3) domains. The QoL score of the domains for participants affected by flooding was significantly lower than that of those not affected, except for social relations. Multivariable logistic regression showed that subjects with not good QoL had the educational background with no formal education (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.63, 95% CI 1.19–5.83), fairly poor/poor households (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.48–5.12), suffered Musculoskeletal diseases (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02–2.56), unsatisfaction with health status (OR = 5.27, 95% CI 2.44–11.37), family conflicts (OR = 4.51, 95%CI 2.10–9.69), and low levels of social support (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.14–6.02). The analysis also revealed that workers (OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04–0.66) had a better QoL than farmer-fisherman. QoL in disadvantaged coastal communes was low, with the lowest scores in the physical health domain. Based on the socioeconomic factors associated with not good QoL identified here, it is recommended that local authorities take more appropriate and practical measures to increase support, including measures for all aspects of physical health, psychological health, social relations, and the living environment, especially for people affected by floods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coastal Area; Flood; Quality Of Life; Whoqol-bref; Cross-sectional Study; Epidemiology; Health Status; Human; Psychology; Quality Of Life; Questionnaire; Viet Nam; Cross-sectional Studies; Health Status; Humans; Quality Of Life; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam,cross-sectional study; epidemiology; health status; human; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; Viet Nam; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Humans; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam,,,"The authors would like to thank the students (Dr. Truong Huynh Anh Khoa and others) and the local volunteers who helped collect the data.

Most recent text generation models have mainly utilized the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and achieved promising results. However, while working on this problem, we observed that important indicators like salient words and sentences from downstream generation tasks can still be useful and beneficial for enhancing the performance. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring and investigating the contribution of auxiliary supervised learning tasks to improve the performance of PLMs for text generation. To this end, we observe the nature of text generation under three scenarios: incomplete utterance restoration, question generation, and summarization. The observation suggests that the indicators can be beneficial for text generation. We reflect this nature by defining a set of auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we design a model that considers both auxiliary tasks and the main text generation task under the joint training manner. The efficiency of the model is validated in the three generation scenarios. The results of the extensive experiments on 10 datasets for the three scenarios and languages show that the auxiliary tasks significantly contribute to improving the performance of PLMs for the main generation task. The ablation study facilitates the next studies of text generation by showing the behavior of the model in different settings. The model is simple, effective, and flexible for other text generation tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Auxiliary Tasks; Joint Training; Pre-trained Language Models; Text Generation; Self-supervised Learning; Auxiliary Task; Down-stream; Joint Training; Language Model; Language Processing; Natural Languages; Performance; Power; Pre-trained Language Model; Text Generations,Self-supervised learning; Auxiliary task; Down-stream; Joint training; Language model; Language processing; Natural languages; Performance; Power; Pre-trained language model; Text generations,,,"This work was supported by Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam, under the grant number B2024-SKH-01.","Ouyang, Long, Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, (2022); Yu, Wenhao, A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Text Generation, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 11 s, (2022); IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (2023); Yuan, Weizhe, BARTSCORE: Evaluating Generated Text as Text Generation, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 27263-27277, (2021); Pan, Zhufeng, Improving open-domain dialogue systems via multi-turn incomplete utterance restoration, pp. 1824-1833, (2019); Inoue, Shumpei, Enhance Incomplete Utterance Restoration by Joint Learning Token Extraction and Text Generation, pp. 3149-3158, (2022); Jia, Xin, How to ask good questions?

The analysis reveals that Jamaica has the potential to increase its wind power output by 8.99% compared to the current production of 99 MW. This expansion could significantly contribute to offsetting fossil fuel-based energy consumption and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It identifies sites across several parishes, including Westmoreland, Clarendon, St. Mary, and St. James, as highly suitable for utility-scale wind farm development.

This, together with increased climate-change-driven hazards, and deplorable slum characteristics has led to considerably higher flood impacts in slum settlements. As such, there is a need for specialized flood vulnerability assessment tools that integrate features specific to the urban slums. Studies have consecrated efforts to integrated and multidimensional flood vulnerability studies. However, assessments that include social, economic, structural, and institutional realities of the slum settlements are rare in developing countries. This study comprehensively assessed the flood vulnerability in urban slums. It offers a simplified perspective of vulnerability in urban slums, capturing data from slum inhabitants, local councils, experts, and local NGOs since they often have profound insights into essential service availability, access, and quality within the study area. Utilizing data encompassing 40 indicators (exposure, susceptibility, and resilience), we assess the physical/structural, social, and economic/psychological vulnerability indices for slum households and the institutional vulnerability of 41 entities. Despite significant challenges of poor infrastructure and lack of basic disaster management tools, slum residents have developed recognizable strategies to overcome flooding. Institutions carrying out intervention activities in the slums were largely incompetent and plagued with challenges ranging from lack of technical know-how to access to funds and coordination. Finally, a significant gap exists between state efforts and the impacts of these efforts on the residents of these slums. These findings complement household-level data and provide an expanded understanding of vulnerability patterns, thus informing policymakers about interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Flood Vulnerability Index (fvi); Household Surveys; Resilience; Risk Communication; Urban Slums,,,,"This work was supported by the Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology, and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), the Research Unit for Realization of Sustainable Society (RURSS) at Kyoto University, and the JSPS Core-to-Core Program (Grant Number: JPJSCCB20220004).

The primary objective is to evaluate changes in precipitation, temperature, and water balance components under different climate scenarios. We employed a multi-modal ensemble (MME) approach to enhance the accuracy of climate projections, integrating historical climate data spanning from 1950 to 2014 with downscaled projections for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, covering future periods from 2040 to 2100. Our methodology involved calibrating and validating the SWAT model against observed hydrological data to ensure reliable simulations of future climate scenarios. The model’s performance was assessed using metrics such as R2, NSE, KGE, and PBIAS, which closely aligned with recommended standards. Results reveal a significant decline in mean annual precipitation, with reductions of up to 37.86% by mid-century under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. This decline is projected to lead to substantial reductions in surface runoff, evapotranspiration, and water yield, alongside a marked decrease in mean monthly stream flow, critically impacting agricultural, domestic, and ecological water needs. The study underscores the necessity of adaptive water resource management strategies to address these anticipated changes. Key recommendations include implementing a dynamic reservoir operation system, enhancing forecasting tools, and incorporating green infrastructure to maintain water quality, support ecosystem resilience, and ensure sustainable water use in the RRB. This research emphasizes the need for localized strategies to address climate-driven hydrological changes and protect future water resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptive Strategies; Climate Change; Hydrological Dynamics; Ruzizi River Basin; Water Resource Management; Evapotranspiration; Resource Allocation; Water Management; Adaptive Strategy; Future Projections; Historical Data; Hydrological Dynamic; Management Strategies; Model Outputs; River Basins; Ruzizi River Basin; Water Resources Management; Waters Resources; Rivers; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Climate Modeling; Future Prospect; Hydrodynamics; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Strategic Approach; Water Budget; Water Management; Water Resource; Water Use; East African Lakes; Lake Tanganyika,Evapotranspiration; Resource allocation; Water management; Adaptive strategy; Future projections; Historical data; Hydrological dynamic; Management strategies; Model outputs; River basins; Ruzizi river basin; Water resources management; Waters resources; Rivers; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; future prospect; hydrodynamics; soil and water assessment tool; strategic approach; water budget; water management; water resource; water use; East African Lakes; Lake Tanganyika,,,"Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), Research Unit for Realization of Sustainable Society (RURSS) at Kyoto University, JSPS Core-to-Core Program (Grant Number: JPJSCCB20220004).

When combined with the clinical, historical, and epidemiological literature on scurvy, survivorship analysis, a form of statistical analysis to assess the relationship between the presence of diseases in the archeological record and survival, helps determine the overall burden of the disease both in terms of morbidity and mortality. This article explores the relationship between scurvy and survivorship in 26 adults from Man Bac, a Neolithic site from northern Vietnam together with prepublished evidence of scurvy in the nonadult population (n = 44).

Assessing diagnostic certainty for scurvy and rickets in human skeletal remains. American Journal of Biological Anthropology, 181, 637–645 diagnostic certainty approaches. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were produced to assess the relationship between the presence of probable scurvy and age-at-death. Results: The prevalence of probable scurvy in adults (35%) was considerably lower than reported for the nonadults (80%). Almost all lesions observed in the adults were in a mixed stage of healing. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in survivorship between infants and children (<15 years) with or without probable scurvy, whereas a meaningful difference was observed for the adults and adolescents (15+ years). Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that scurvy considerably decreased survivorship to older age categories. The degree of lesion remodeling, however, indicates that scurvy was not necessarily the direct cause of death but contributed to an overall disease burden that was ultimately fatal. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Transition; Demography; Osteological Paradox; Survivorship; Vietnam; Adult; Agricultural Transition Site; Agriculture; Anemia; Archeology; Article; Body Remains; Bone Remodeling; Clinical Article; Cohabitation; Demography; Diagnostic Accuracy; Differential Diagnosis; Enamel Hypoplasia; Female; Fracture; Gingivitis; Head Circumference; Hematoma; Human; Hypothalamus Hypophysis Adrenal System; Immediate Cause Of Death; Inflammation; Kaplan Meier Method; Lethargy; Male; Marine Environment; Maternal Mortality; Mental Health Service; Morbidity; Mortality; Neolithic; Osteopenia; Osteoporosis; Parasite Load; Pellagra; Periodontal Disease; Physical Anthropology; Population Growth; Prevalence; Pubic Symphysis; Respiratory Failure; Rickets; Risk Factor; Scurvy; Seasonal Variation; Southeast Asia; Survivorship; Tooth Disease; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Aged; Child; Epidemiology; History; Infant; Middle Aged; Preschool Child; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Scurvy; Survivorship; Vietnam; Young Adult","adult; agricultural transition site; agriculture; anemia; archeology; Article; body remains; bone remodeling; clinical article; cohabitation; demography; diagnostic accuracy; differential diagnosis; enamel hypoplasia; female; fracture; gingivitis; head circumference; hematoma; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; immediate cause of death; inflammation; Kaplan Meier method; lethargy; male; marine environment; maternal mortality; mental health service; morbidity; mortality; Neolithic; osteopenia; osteoporosis; parasite load; pellagra; periodontal disease; physical anthropology; population growth; prevalence; pubic symphysis; respiratory failure; rickets; risk factor; scurvy; seasonal variation; Southeast Asia; survivorship; tooth disease; Viet Nam; adolescent; aged; child; epidemiology; history; infant; middle aged; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Scurvy; Survivorship; Vietnam; Young Adult",,,"We would like to thank Dr. Ngo Anh Son, Dr. Bui Van Khanh, and Dr. Nellissa Ling for their assistance with the radiographs.

However, recent empirical research has challenged the supremacy of frequency as a predictor of word difficulty. Accordingly, applied linguists have questioned the use of frequency as the principal criterion in the development of wordlists and vocabulary tests. Despite being informative, previous studies on the topic have been limited in the way the researchers measured word difficulty and the statistical techniques they employed for exploratory data analysis. In the current study, meaning recall was used as a measure of word difficulty, and random forest was employed to examine the importance of various lexical sophistication metrics in predicting word difficulty.

In emerging Asia, where small family businesses play central roles in their economies, previous studies found that the sector was particularly hard hit by the pandemic. However, little is known about how households have mitigated the negative shocks on their family business during the pandemic. Using datasets from representative household surveys in seventeen Asian countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) regions, this study investigates the role of business coping strategies and government financial aid in mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic on family business conditions in the short run. We find that (i) adoption of coping strategy is associated with a lower probability of both a decline in family business income and family business closure; and (ii) government financial aid is associated with a lower probability of a decline in family business income and a higher probability of adopting coping strategies. This study is one of the first to provide empirical evidence on mitigation mechanisms of family business in emerging Asia. This is important to understand what policies will enable the family business sector to perform better during the future pandemics and other economic crises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Central Asia; Coping Strategy; Covid-19; Family Business; Financial Aid; Southeast Asia; Asean; Business Development; Coping Strategy; Covid-19; Finance; Household Survey; Humanitarian Aid; State Role; Central Asia,ASEAN; business development; coping strategy; COVID-19; finance; household survey; humanitarian aid; state role; Central Asia,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI).

Results show a positive relationship between changes in electricity consumption and changes in household income, suggesting that households reduced their electricity usage following a decrease in income.

However, research on the impacts of ETS in Vietnam is still unclear, especially since there is no study on ETS revenue redistribution policies. By developing a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this paper simulates the potential impacts of the ETS with different revenue redistribution options. The results indicate that to achieve Vietnam's target of 15.8% carbon emission reduction, the carbon price would significantly affect the economy with a GDP drop of 3.7% and a welfare loss of 2.89% of GDP. The revenue redistribution policies would lighten these negative impacts. While transferring to government activities reduces GDP loss, reducing income tax policy results in welfare improvement. At the sectoral level, the electricity sector is most negatively affected and also plays a key role in reducing carbon emissions in Vietnam. The revenue redistribution for government activities could improve outputs for the construction and some heavy industries while the revenue redistribution policy for households creates improvements for light industries and the electricity industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cge; Economics; Environment; Ets; Redistribution Policy; Vietnam; Carbon Emission; Computable General Equilibrium Analysis; Emission Control; Emissions Trading; Environmental Economics; Gross Domestic Product; Viet Nam,carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; Viet Nam,,,,"Adams, Philip David, An emissions trading scheme for Australia: National and regional impacts, Economic Record, 90, 290, pp. 316-344, (2014); Choi, Yongrok, The economy impacts of Korean ETS with an emphasis on sectoral coverage based on a CGE approach, Energy Policy, 109, pp. 835-844, (2017); Futures, (2015); Fiscal Policies for Paris Climate Strategiesfrom Principle to Practice Policy Paper no 19 136 Issue May, (2019); Jia, Zhijie, What kind of enterprises and residents bear more responsibilities in carbon trading?

In Japan, government and commercial stakeholders are promulgating emotional AI not only as a neoliberal, cost-saving benefit but also as a heuristic that can improve the learning experience at home and in the classroom. Nevertheless, critics warn of a myriad of risks and harms posed by the technology such as privacy violation, unresolved deeper cultural and systemic issues, machinic parentalism as well as the danger of imposing attitudinal conformity. This study brings together the Technological Acceptance Model and Moral Foundation Theory to examine the cultural construal of risks and rewards regarding the application of emotional AI technologies. It explores Japanese citizens’ perceptions of emotional AI in education and children's toys via analysis of a final sample of 2000 Japanese respondents with five age groups (20s–60s) and two sexes equally represented. The linear regression models for determinants of attitude toward emotional AI in education and in toys account for 44 % and 38 % variation in the data, respectively. The analyses reveal a significant negative correlation between attitudes toward emotional AI in both schools and toys and concerns about privacy violations or the dystopian nature of constantly monitoring of children and students’ emotions with AI (Education: β<inf>DystopianConcern</inf> = − .094***; Toys: β<inf>PrivacyConcern</inf> = − .199***). However, worries about autonomy and bias show mixed results, which hints at certain cultural nuances of values in a Japanese context and how new the technologies are. Concurring with the empirical literature on the Moral Foundation Theory, the chi-square (Χ2) test shows Japanese female respondents express more fear regarding the potential harms of emotional AI technologies for the youth's privacy, autonomy, data misuse, and fairness (p < 0.001).

Although research on Vietnam tourism has grown in number, a macro analysis of national tourism governance and policies has largely been missing. Design/methodology/approach: This synthesis paper offers a systemic analysis of Vietnam’s tourism accommodating intensified government intervention and dramatic market changes in recent decades. The authors offer a chronological analysis of tourism development along with the major political and economic turns of the country. Findings: The patterns of tourism development reflect a compromise between centralization and decentralization of the governance system and a trade-off between economic and social objectives of development. Balancing these opposites, the internal strength of the domestic market and the resilience of communities and businesses become key assets for growth in circumstances where the socialist market economy continues to inform the current and future development of the industry. Research limitations/implications: Although the case of Vietnam is unique, the adaptive mechanism of the tourism industry highlighted in this paper offers a useful lesson for other developing countries. The research addresses tourism in the political economy in developing countries, which is valuable for researchers, policy analysts as well as practitioners in tourism. Practical implications: The practical contribution of the study is derived from authors’ academic and industrial backgrounds. Findings from the study serve as a useful reference for those who embark on the study of tourism governance and policy-making in developing countries and problems associated with the economic transitional process. Those problems of the disparity between centralization and decentralization of the political system might not be only significant in Vietnam, but also prevail in developing countries. Thus, this study offers a point of departure for future empirical and comparative research on the kindship of tourism and political economy in a full scale. Social implications: The transitional economy as viewed through the tourism industry is prominently presented in the “evolutionary” approach to the transitional economy, which exhibits several unique features: the transition from a centrally planned (command) economy to a market economy and the manifestations of a socialist orientation in the modern economic management system (Vuong et al., 2019). While data from this study is mainly illustrative of the first point, the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, the second characteristic, the manifestation of a social orientation has only slightly been addressed and will need further elaboration in a future study. While Vietnam’s tourism positions itself in a socialist market-oriented economy might set a unique case, the study highlights the politics of tourism is shaped by the politico-economic system. The authors conclude that the adaptation of Vietnam tourism to a socialist market-orientated economy is better perceived as a social evolution achievement rather than a feature of capitalism. Originality/value: The latest study on tourism governance (Bui et al., 2022) has outlined the evolution of the tourism administrative system and markets in the country; however, linkages of tourism to the broader political economic system have yet to be addressed. Addressing this gap, the authors carry out analysis of policies and governance from the insider’s viewpoint, when team members have been involved in numerous tourism planning and development projects, both on international and national scales. The practical experience along with thorough review of literature and statistical data contributes to shaping a fresh understanding of tourism in a transitional economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Centralization; Decentralization; Governance; Planning; Socialist Market Economy,,,,"The project is funded through Japan Society for Promotion of Sciences, grant number 22H03859.","Journal of Vietnamese Studies, (2018); Tourism in Southeast Asia Challenges and New Direction, (2009); Britton, Stephen G., Tourism, capital, and place: towards a critical geography of tourism, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 9, 4, pp. 451-478, (1991); Britton, Stephen G., The political economy of tourism in the third world, Annals of Tourism Research, 9, 3, pp. 331-358, (1982); Austrian Journal of South East Asian Studies, (2011); Global Climate Change and Coastal Tourism, (2017); Tourism and Development in Southeast Asia, (2020); Bui, Huong T., The History and Evolution of Vietnam Tourism, pp. 12-27, (2022); Bui, Huong T., The adaptive resilience of living cultural heritage in a tourism destination, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 28, 7, pp. 1022-1040, (2020); Bui, Huong T., Tourism Policies and Governance, pp. 28-44, (2022)",,Emerald Publishing,,,,,,16605373; 17598451,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191759457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although meaning-recognition is generally more convenient, think-aloud protocols have revealed that in comparison to meaning-recall, meaning-recognition is more susceptible to blind guessing and the use of construct-irrelevant test strategies. Perhaps because of this, meaning-recall tends to be a stronger predictor of reading ability. Following Budescu (1988), this article reports on three studies that investigated an extended-matching test (EMT) format that was designed to address these limitations of meaning-recognition while retaining its convenience. An EMT with 90 target words was developed. It contained three clusters, each with a 30:130 ratio of target words to Vietnamese L2 response options. In comparison to meaning-recall criterion measures, the EMT did not meaningfully differ in terms of internal reliability, mean scores, and, importantly, the strength of the correlation with reading comprehension scores. The consistency of correct/incorrect response classifications ranged from 83 % to 86 %. These initial findings suggest that the EMT format may be used interchangeably with meaning-recall for many research purposes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Assisted Meaning-recall; Extended-matching; Meaning-recall; Meaning-recognition; Second Language Vocabulary Testing,,,,,"Aviad-Levitzky, Tami, The New Computer Adaptive Test of Size and Strength (CATSS): Development and Validation, Language Assessment Quarterly, 16, 3, pp. 345-368, (2019); Barr, Dale J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal, Journal of Memory and Language, 68, 3, pp. 255-278, (2013); undefined, (2020); Vocabulary Education and Research Bulletin, (2012); Brysbaert, Marc, Power analysis and effect size in mixed effects models: A tutorial, Journal of Cognition, 1, 1, (2018); Budescu, David V., On the Feasibility of Multiple Matching Tests— Variations on a Theme by Guiliksen, Applied Psychological Measurement, 12, 1, pp. 5-14, (1988); undefined, (2008); International Journal of Internet Science, (2016); Green, Peter, SIMR: An R package for power analysis of generalized linear mixed models by simulation, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 7, 4, pp. 493-498, (2016); Gries, Stefan Th, (Generalized Linear) Mixed-Effects Modeling: A Learner Corpus Example, Language Learning, 71, 3, pp. 757-798, (2021)",,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,27727661,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190960943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are limited studies on the effect of firm clusters on the well-being of rural communities, particularly in terms of income improvement, poverty reduction, and migration. Our research aims to shed light on these relationships at both the household and commune levels. For empirical analysis, we employ the propensity score matching method to mitigate endogeneity bias. Our results reveal the role of firm clusters in increasing income and reducing poverty. Firm clusters also contribute to decreasing labor emigration and attracting immigrants. However, the magnitude of these impacts is relatively small, with moderate effects on income and modest effects on poverty and migration. In particular, firm clusters reduce the commune poverty rate by around 2.36%–2.51% and enhance household annual income by approximately 16.46–17.08 million VND (725–752 USD). Furthermore, analyses at the household level highlight the significance of larger clusters in improving household income. Our research underscores policy implications for rural development with a specific emphasis on firm clusters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Developing Country; Firm Cluster; Migration; Poverty; Welfare; Developing World; Economic Development; Emigration; Empirical Analysis; Household Income; Labor Migration; Poverty Alleviation; Rural Development; Viet Nam,developing world; economic development; emigration; empirical analysis; household income; labor migration; poverty alleviation; rural development; Viet Nam,,,Pham Tien Thanh is grateful to the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for the award of JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research in Japan (Standard).

Although ample studies have explored the determinants of healthcare spending, the current study examines the determinants of health financing transition in 124 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for 19 years, from 2000 to 2018. The study first estimates the elasticity of health expenditure (i.e., government, private, and external) to per capita income, fiscal spending, age dependency, control of corruption, and time; second, it investigates crowding-out/in effects between domestic and external health financing. As the sample countries are heterogeneous in terms of development and universal health coverage (UHC) reform, our study employs a panel regression model with cluster-robust fixed effects and a bootstrapping quantile regression with fixed effects model to capture unobserved heterogeneity and produce robust estimates across quantile distributions. The results show that an increase in per capita government health expenditure (GHE) and per capita external health expenditure from foreign donors can reduce the share of out-of-pocket health expenditure to total health expenditure (OOPHE), thereby improving the health status and well-being of the people. The study also finds crowding-out effects of per capita external health financing on GHE in LIMCs. Interestingly, the results show that the control of corruption increases the per capita GHE in low-income countries. Thus, in low-income countries, improving governance would improve efficiency in fund utilization and strengthen the health system. Further, our study concludes that those countries that have passed UHC legislation are moving faster toward health financing transition by increasing public spending on health care. Healthcare policy in developing countries should prioritize (i) the adoption and implementation of UHC reform, (ii) alternative revenue mobilization strategy for financing public health care. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",C21; Control Of Corruption; D63; Distributional Heterogeneity; External Health Assistance; F35; Government Health Expenditure; H51; I18; K42; Quantile Regression; Universal Health Coverage Legislation; Age; Bootstrapping; Corruption; Developing World; Finance; Health Expenditure; Health Insurance; Health Policy; Health Status; International Aid; Regression,age; bootstrapping; corruption; developing world; finance; health expenditure; health insurance; health policy; health status; international aid; regression,,,,"Arends, Helge, More with Less?

While vendors tout the neoliberal incentives of emotion-recognition technology as a pre-eminent tool of workplace wellness, we argue that emotional AI recalibrates the horizons of capital not by expanding outward into the consumer realm (like surveillance capitalism). Rather, as a new genus of digital Taylorism, it turns inward, passing through the corporeal exterior to extract greater surplus value and managerial control from the affective states of workers. Thus, empathic surveillance signals a profound shift in the ontology of human labor relations. In the emotionally quantified workplace, employees are no longer simply seen as physical capital, but conduits of actuarial and statistical intelligence gleaned from their most intimate subjective states. As a result, affect-driven automated management means that priority is often given to actuarial rather than human-centered managerial decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Affect; Automated Management; Digital Taylorism; Emotional Ai; Future Of Work; Precarity; Surveillance; Automation; Emotion Recognition; Affect; Affect Recognition; Automated Management; Digital Taylorism; Emotional Ai; Future Of Works; Human-centric; Precarity; Surveillance; Wellbeing; Human Resource Management,Automation; Emotion Recognition; Affect; Affect recognition; Automated management; Digital taylorism; Emotional AI; Future of works; Human-centric; Precarity; Surveillance; Wellbeing; Human resource management,,,"This study is part of the project \u201CEmotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life \u201D funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6.

These programs involve the students as internal customers and the business partners as external customers. However, previous studies have yet to examine the management of the relationships with these customers and the logistics of the internship programs. Without this understanding, the internship management and preparation processes may be difficult or inadequate. Therefore, this chapter reports a study investigating the challenges in relationship management in internships and the methods adopted to negotiate with these challenges. The study employed the information provided by two faculty members at a public university in Vietnam via a collaborative autoethnography. This information was also aligned with the existing literature as a validation tactic. The findings revealed a management process of 20 steps and four phases. Each step's challenges (e.g., late responses, sudden cancellation, and agreement violations) and negotiation methods (e.g., backup plans, crisis management, activeness, and flexibility) were detailed. The fundamental logistics functions, including information handling, inventory, packaging, and transportation, were linked to the phases. The chapter then discussed these findings to build up a theory about educational internship logistics and provide some implications for better managing the internship programs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Collaborative Autoethnography; Education Logistics; Internship; Relationship Management; Vietnam,,,,,"Acosta, Sandra T., Autoethnography in action research for health education practitioners, Action Research, 13, 4, pp. 411-431, (2015); Handbook of Autoethnography, (2013); Aktas, Emel, Outsourcing logistics activities in Turkey, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 18, 3, pp. 316-329, (2005); Alebaikan, Reem, Online and face-to-face guest lectures: graduate students' perceptions, Learning and Teaching in Higher Education: Gulf Perspectives, 13, 2, pp. 53-65, (2016); Alexakis, George, Industry Competencies and the Optimal Hospitality Management Curriculum: An Empirical Study, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Education, 31, 4, pp. 210-220, (2019); Anayah, Bernadette, The Growth of International Student Enrollment at Community Colleges and Implications, Community College Journal of Research and Practice, 39, 12, pp. 1099-1110, (2015); Bhaskar, A.

Using a unique bi-annually household-level dataset from 2012–2016 from Vietnam, we obtain key findings as follows. To mitigate possible endogeneity concerns, we utilize a two-stage least squares regression (2SLS) approach, employing the development of information and communication (ICT) infrastructure at the province level as an instrumental variable (IV). The key findings can be summarized as follows. First, urbanization significantly reduces Vietnamese households’ inpatient and outpatient health expenses. Second, the self-treatment expenses of households increase as the process of urbanization advances. In addition, we perform various robustness checks, encompassing different measures of urbanization, the use of lag of urbanization as an additional IV, and the plausible exogenous IV. The outcomes derived from these rigorous sensitivity analyses substantiate the reliability and consistency of our key results. Finally, we propose different ways to explain these results, including health insurance expenses and household income. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Health Expenditure; Health Insurance; Ict; Instrumental Variable; Urbanization; Vhlss,,,,We acknowledge the financial support that we received from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up (Grant No.23K18795).,"Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled, The effects of health insurance on health-seeking behaviour: Evidence from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Risk Management and Healthcare Policy, 13, pp. 595-607, (2020); Anderson, Michael L., The effect of health insurance coverage on the use of medical services, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 4, 1, pp. 1-27, (2012); Attard, Samantha M., Multilevel examination of diabetes in modernising China: What elements of urbanisation are most associated with diabetes?, Diabetologia, 55, 12, pp. 3182-3192, (2012); Chen, Guo, Urbanization and income inequality in post-reform China: A causal analysis based on time series data, PLOS ONE, 11, 7, (2016); Clarke, Damian, Practical considerations for questionable IVs, Stata Journal, 18, 3, pp. 663-691, (2018); Conley, Timothy G., Plausibly exogenous, Review of Economics and Statistics, 94, 1, pp. 260-272, (2012); Dumlupinar Universitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, (2019); Danaei, Goodarz, The global cardiovascular risk transition: Associations of four metabolic risk factors with national income, urbanization, and western diet in 1980 and 2008, Circulation, 127, 14, pp. 1493-1502, (2013); Dang, Thang, Do the more educated utilize more health care services?

In Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), groups speaking these languages are concentrated in the highlands of Vietnam. However, our knowledge of the spread of AN-speaking populations in MSEA remains limited; in particular, it is not clear if AN languages were spread by demic or cultural diffusion. In this study, we present and analyze new data consisting of complete mitogenomes from 369 individuals and 847 Y-chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 170 individuals from all five Vietnamese Austronesian groups (VN-AN) and five neighboring Vietnamese Austroasiatic groups (VN-AA). We found genetic signals consistent with matrilocality in some, but not all, of the VN-AN groups. Population affinity analyses indicated connections between the AN-speaking Giarai and certain Taiwanese AN groups (Rukai, Paiwan, and Bunun). However, overall, there were closer genetic affinities between VN-AN groups and neighboring VN-AA groups, suggesting language shifts. Our study provides insights into the genetic structure of AN-speaking communities in MSEA, characterized by some contact with Taiwan and language shift in neighboring groups, indicating that the expansion of AN speakers in MSEA was a combination of cultural and demic diffusion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Mitochondrial; Article; Controlled Study; Cultural Anthropology; Diffusion; Epidemiology; Gene Structure; Male; Pacific Islands; Sex; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Southeast Asia; Speech; Taiwan; Taiwanese; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Female; Genetics; Human; Language; Population Genetics; Sexism; Y Chromosome; Mitochondrial Dna; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Dna, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Language; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sexism; Vietnam","article; controlled study; cultural anthropology; diffusion; epidemiology; gene structure; male; Pacific islands; sex; single nucleotide polymorphism; Southeast Asia; speech; Taiwan; Taiwanese; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; female; genetics; human; language; population genetics; sexism; Y chromosome; mitochondrial DNA; Chromosomes, Human, Y; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Language; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sexism; Vietnam",,"DNA, Mitochondrial","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Vietnam (TL.CN.60/ 19).

One mechanism for promotion of economic development is government-driven policy. The problem is that it is not clear whether public-led economic promotion attracts consumers and which promotion factors are relatively significant for boosting particular goods. This paper examines attributes of green tea products likely influencing consumer preferences, focusing on the Thai Nguyen area in Vietnam as an example. In this area, the “One Commune, One Product” (OCOP) project has been implemented by the local government. This study employs randomized conjoint analysis based on data collected from 450 randomly selected consumers in several local supermarkets. Interestingly, the results show that online style sales have a negative preference for the purchase of green tea products, while transparency, such as the traceability of the product and product information, and reliability, such as certification, enhance the purchase of these products by consumers. However, this finding is not necessarily robust because our results indicate that approximately 90% of consumers tend to choose the default pair, which means that they do not actively prefer the product, possibly implying that this kind of public-led promotion is not yet broadly familiar to all people. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attributes For Preference; Causal Inference; Conjoint Analysis; Green Tea; Ocop; Thai Nguyen; Certification; Conjoint Analysis; Consumption Behavior; Economic Development; Local Government; Marketing; Perception; Public Attitude; Tea; Thai Nguyen; Viet Nam,certification; conjoint analysis; consumption behavior; economic development; local government; marketing; perception; public attitude; tea; Thai Nguyen; Viet Nam,,,,"World Tea Production and Trade Current and Future Development 2015; Hong, Nguyen Bich, Improvement in irrigation water use efficiency: a strategy for climate change adaptation and sustainable development of Vietnamese tea production, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 19, 4, pp. 1247-1263, (2017); Munasinghe, Mohan, Economic, social and environmental impacts and overall sustainability of the tea sector in Sri Lanka, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 12, pp. 155-169, (2017); Deka, Nabajyoti, Organic cultivation and sustainable value chain development for tea smallholders: Findings from Assam, India, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 32, pp. 562-579, (2022); Hong, Nguyen Bich, Environmental efficiency and economic losses of Vietnamese tea production: Implications for cost savings and environmental protection, Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, 61, 2, pp. 383-390, (2016); Global Market Report Cocoa, (2019); Biggs, Eloise M., The tea landscape of Assam: Multi-stakeholder insights into sustainable livelihoods under a changing climate, Environmental Science and Policy, 82, pp. 9-18, (2018); Ganbold, Narangerel, An evaluation of subsidy policy impacts, transient and persistent technical efficiency: A case of Mongolia, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 7, pp. 9223-9242, (2022); Crops and Livestock Products, (2024); Nguyen-Thi-Lan, Huong, Crop farming and technical efficiency of tea production nexus: An analysis of environmental impacts, Journal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences, 22, 3, pp. 158-164, (2023)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,,,20711050,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195807782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that the reduction in women's and men's self-employment would delay family formation and childbirth, with the ultimate impact on marriage remaining ambiguous. Analyzing data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys, we find that both men and women are less likely to be self-employed in the face of a substantial trade shock. Notably, the decreasing impact on women's self-employment becomes more pronounced than that for men post-2012, a decade after the agreement's enforcement. Employing the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and survival analysis, we empirically demonstrate that increased exposure to trade postpones women's timing of marriage and first childbirth. On average, in 2013, the BTA resulted in a 7.39- and 7.42 %-point decrease in the probability of entering marriage and becoming a mother, respectively. We also present suggestive evidence that increased exposure to trade liberalization eventually increases the likelihood of marriage and the number of children among women over 40. The findings in this study imply that policy promoting trade liberalization should consider its extensive impacts on young labor force's family formation through change in their individual economic prospects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Delayed Fertility; Marriage And Fertility In Vietnam; Marriage Timing; Reproductive Decision-making; Trade Liberalization,,,,This work was supported by the Policy Research Center at National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies [Project Number: P231RP201 .,"Amiti, Mary, Trade liberalization, intermediate inputs, and productivity: Evidence from Indonesia, American Economic Review, 97, 5, pp. 1611-1638, (2007); Ngo, Anh P., Effects of Vietnam’s two-child policy on fertility, son preference, and female labor supply, Journal of Population Economics, 33, 3, pp. 751-794, (2020); American Economic Review Insights, (2019); Journal of Political Economy, (1973); A Treatise on the Family, (1981); Black, Sandra E., Importing equality?

To date, most studies have focused on ECs in industrialized economies. Less have considered barriers to electric mobility in developing countries, where motorcycles provide most transport. To contribute to this literature, this study aimed to systematically compare differences between barriers that impede EC and EM adoption. Focusing on Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, we leveraged data from a quantitative survey (n = 944) targeting potential adopters. Using exploratory factor analysis and a regression model, we investigated the influence of structural conditions—environmental, economic, social, institutional, etc.—on psychological factors that hamper EC/EM purchase intentions. Our findings reveal important commonalities and differences across barriers that hamper adoption intentions for each technology. This study thereby improves understanding of the complex interdependence among structural conditions in urban settings and their role in creating psychological barriers to electric mobility adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adoption; Barriers; Developing Countries; Electric Vehicles; Purchase Intention; Vietnam; Economics; Electric Loads; Electric Motorcycles; Energy Security; Factor Analysis; Regression Analysis; Adoption; Barrier; Electric Cars; Electric Mobility; Electric Motorcycle; Environmental Loads; Purchase Intention; Structural Condition; Transportation System; Viet Nam; Developing Countries; Cycle Transport; Developing World; Electric Vehicle; Factor Analysis; Regression Analysis; Ho Chi Minh City,Economics; Electric loads; Electric motorcycles; Energy security; Factor analysis; Regression analysis; Adoption; Barrier; Electric cars; Electric mobility; Electric motorcycle; Environmental loads; Purchase intention; Structural condition; Transportation system; Viet Nam; Developing countries; cycle transport; developing world; electric vehicle; factor analysis; regression analysis; Ho Chi Minh City,,,,"undefined, (2009); Adhikari, Madhusudhan, Identification and analysis of barriers against electric vehicle use, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 12, (2020); Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, (1991); Sustainable Cities Authenticity Ambition and Dream, (2018); Bastos, Suzana Quinet De Andrade, Is there a relationship between the use of motorcycles and the level of development of countries?, Bulletin of Geography.

Our findings are three-fold. First, provincial income clustering in Vietnam follows patterns of club convergence towards multiple equilibria. Seven convergence clubs encompassing 61 provinces are identified. Second, spatial autocorrelation encourages neighboring provinces to converge toward shared income equilibria. High-income clusters are observed in the Northern and Southern Key Economic Regions, while low-income clusters are concentrated in the mountainous areas of Northern Vietnam. Finally, both internal and external factors significantly affect the formation of convergence clubs. Vital internal factors include localities’ initial conditions of physical capital and structural change. Meanwhile, external factors refer to spatial externalities among neighboring provinces. We highlight spatial complementarity in physical capital accumulation and spatial competition in industrial intensification among neighboring provinces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Club Convergence; Income Clustering; O40; O47; R10; R11; Spatial Dependence; Spatial Externalities; Structural Changes; Vietnam,,,,,"Aginta, Harry, Spatial dynamics of consumer price in Indonesia: convergence clubs and conditioning factors, Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science, 5, 2, pp. 427-451, (2021); Anselin, Luc E., Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA, Geographical Analysis, 27, 2, pp. 93-115, (1995); Bartkowska, Monika, Regional convergence clubs in Europe: Identification and conditioning factors, Economic Modelling, 29, 1, pp. 22-31, (2012); Bentzen, Jan, Regional income convergence in an emerging Asian economy: empirical evidence from Vietnam, Post-Communist Economies, 33, 1, pp. 64-78, (2021); Cutrini, Eleonora, Economic integration, structural change, and uneven development in the European Union, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 50, pp. 102-113, (2019); Le, Thi Thu Diem, Fiscal decentralization and income convergence: evidence from Vietnam, Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy, 29, 3, pp. 1513-1532, (2024); Revilla Diez, Javier, Vietnam 30 years after Doi Moi: Achievements and challenges, Zeitschrift fur Wirtschaftsgeographie, 60, 3, pp. 121-133, (2016); Du, Kerui, Econometric convergence test and club clustering using stata, Stata Journal, 17, 4, pp. 882-900, (2017); Spatial Econometrics from Cross Sectional Data to Spatial Panels, (2014); Esiyok, Bulent, A SPATIAL REGRESSION APPROACH to FDI in Vietnam: PROVINCE-LEVEL EVIDENCE, Singapore Economic Review, 62, 2, pp. 459-481, (2017)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,,,,,25097954,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189915492,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing a double-hurdle model, our empirical findings reveal a negative relationship between energy poverty and health expenditure. Specifically, our results indicate that for each incremental unit increase in energy poverty, there is a substantial reduction of 42.5 percentage points in the overall health expenditure of the households. Furthermore, as energy poverty deepens, we observe declines of 24.6 percentage points and 45.5 percentage points in the expenses incurred for inpatient/outpatient care and self-treatment, respectively. To validate the robustness of our results, we conduct several sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching, double/debiased machine learning. Across all these methods, our findings consistently underscore the significant and persistent adverse impact of energy poverty on the examined outcome variables. Additionally, to examine the underlying pathways, we conduct a structural equation modeling analysis and find that the relationship between energy poverty and health expenses is mediated by household hospitalization and expenditures on essential items, such as food and daily necessities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Energy Poverty; Health Expenditure; Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index; Vhlss,,,,We acknowledge the financial support that we received from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up (Grant No.23K18795).,"Abbas, Khizar, Assessing an empirical relationship between energy poverty and domestic health issues: A multidimensional approach, Energy, 221, (2021); Adusah-Poku, Frank, Energy poverty in Ghana: Any progress so far?, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 112, pp. 853-864, (2019); Ddml Double Debiased Machine Learning in Stata, (2023); Alkire, Sabina, Measuring Acute Poverty in the Developing World: Robustness and Scope of the Multidimensional Poverty Index, World Development, 59, pp. 251-274, (2014); Awaworyi Churchill, Sefa, Neighbourhood ethnic diversity and mental health in Australia, Health Economics (United Kingdom), 28, 9, pp. 1075-1087, (2019); Banerjee, Rajabrata, Energy poverty, health and education outcomes: Evidence from the developing world, Energy Economics, 101, (2021); Bardazzi, Rossella, Ageing and private transport fuel expenditure: Do generations matter?, Energy Policy, 117, pp. 396-405, (2018); Barrella, Roberto, Evaluating the impact of energy efficiency strategies on households’ energy affordability: A Spanish case study, Energy and Buildings, 295, (2023); Bukari, Chei, Energy poverty and health expenditure: Evidence from Ghana, Energy Economics, 103, (2021); Castaño-Rosa, Raúl, Energy poverty goes south?

We tested whether this regressive shift was more acutely perceived and experienced by women in countries with greater gender equality. Cross-cultural longitudinal survey data for women and men (N = 10,238) was collected weekly during the first few months of the pandemic. Multilevel modelling analyses, based on seven waves of data collection, indicated that a regressive shift was broadly perceived but not uniformly felt. Women and men alike perceived a shift toward a more traditional division of household labor during the first few weeks of the pandemic. However, this perception only undermined women’s satisfaction with their personal relationships and subjective mental health if they lived in countries with higher levels of economic gender equality. Among women in countries with lower levels of economic gender equality, the perceived shift predicted higher relationship satisfaction and mental health. There were no such effects among men. Taken together, our results suggest that subjective perceptions of disempowerment, and the gender role norms that underpin them, should be considered when examining the gendered impact of global crisis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Division Of Labor; Gender Equality; Gender Roles; Interpersonal Relationships; Relationship Quality; Well Being,,,,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions This work was funded, in part, by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada awarded to the first author as well as a European Commission Grant (725128) awarded to the second author.","Aarntzen, Lianne, Work-family guilt as a straightjacket.

This is the first regional analysis to systematically document students’ access to remote learning based on survey data and to investigate how school closures and remote learning access affected children's learning progress. The results are based on survey responses from 2200 households. We find that 79% of the respondents felt that their children's learning progress was slower during school closures than it would have been with in-person schooling. Slightly less than half of all children experienced very little or no learning progress. Three characteristics were strongly correlated with learning progress. First, boys were more likely than girls to experience very little or no progress. Second, children from households in the top 30% of the income distribution were more likely to progress at the same rate as in-person classes, compared to children from lower income households. Third, comparing the different remote learning modes, internet-based learning or multiple learning modes provided children with a better chance of maintaining learning progress than other single modes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Covid-19; Learning Loss; School Closure; Southeast Asia; Covid-19; Education; Learning; Pandemic; Student; Southeast Asia,COVID-19; education; learning; pandemic; student; Southeast Asia,,,,"Fixing the Foundation Teachers and Basic Education in East Asia and Pacific, (2023); Andrabi, Tahir, Human Capital Accumulation and Disasters Evidence from the Pakistan Earthquake of 2005, Journal of Human Resources, 58, 4, pp. 1057-1096, (2023); J Southeast Asian Econ, (2023); undefined, (2023); Banerjee, Abhijit V., Pitfalls of participatory programs: Evidence from a randomized evaluation in education in India, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 2, 1, pp. 1-30, (2010); undefined, (2021); Betthäuser, Bastian A., A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature Human Behaviour, 7, 3, pp. 375-385, (2023); Cashman, Laura, Parental involvement in low-achieving children's learning: The role of household wealth in rural India, International Journal of Educational Research, 105, (2021); Dang, Hai Anh H., What Explains Vietnam's Exceptional Performance in Education Relative to Other Countries?

Based on a sample of 800 individuals who visited Da Nang, Vietnam between July and August 2023, a latent class behavior model was developed to investigate preferences for bike-sharing services from tourists’ point of view. The results show that tourists prefer a bike-sharing service that ensures round-the-clock availability, is accessible within a 5-min walk from both the origin and destination, features bikes stationed at specific designated locations, and provides a variety of payment options at an affordable rate of USD 1.00 per h. Under these attributes, about 41.63% of tourists are likely to choose a bike-sharing option for their travel tours.

Focusing on urban residential areas, riverside communities, suburbs, and rural regions, the research investigates the extent and impact of plastic waste in these diverse settings. Additionally, the study examines the accumulation of plastics at barriers, under bridges, and in the Hau River, identifying the predominance of single-use plastics and their environmental implications. The key findings indicate that the plastic waste leakage at land-based-source emission sites is substantial, with waste persisting for extended periods without effective clean-up. The study reveals a significant accumulation of plastics at barriers and bridge bases in aquatic environments, including along the river. The pollution level was observed to be more influenced by the quantity of waste rather than its mass per unit area, emphasizing the need for targeted waste reduction strategies. The study also identifies seven types of plastic, each associated with different sources of accumulation or settlement. This variety presents both challenges and opportunities for waste management and recycling. Significantly, the research underscores the potential of repurposing plastic waste into recycled products, aligning with the circular economy model. This approach not only extends the lifecycle of plastic products but also contributes to reducing plastic waste generation and minimizing the environmental impact.

The study considers the effects of various socioeconomic factors, such as per capita income, social support, freedom to make life choices, perception of corruption, air pollution exposure, and gender inequality, on the level of happiness. We used panel two-way robust fixed effects and panel quantile regression for empirical analysis. The results show that per capita income, social support, and freedom to make life choices positively impact happiness, while air pollution exposure has a negative impact. However, gender inequality does not significantly affect happiness levels. These findings highlight the relevance of the Easterlin Paradox, which suggests that income can mediate happiness by promoting emotional well-being, gender equality, and a clean environment. Therefore, policymakers should focus on creating a more holistic approach to improving the well-being and happiness of its citizens. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Air Pollution Exposure; Easterlin Paradox; Freedom To Make Life Choices; Gender Inequality; Happiness Determinants; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors,,,,,"Angeles, Luis, A closer look at the Easterlin Paradox, Journal of Socio-Economics, 40, 1, pp. 67-73, (2011); Arvin, Mak B., Does income matter in the happiness-corruption relationship?, Journal of Economic Studies, 41, 3, pp. 469-490, (2014); Asadullah, Niaz, Subjective well-being in China, 2005–2010: The role of relative income, gender, and location, China Economic Review, 48, pp. 83-101, (2018); Audette, Andre P., (E)Quality of Life: A Cross-National Analysis of the Effect of Gender Equality on Life Satisfaction, Journal of Happiness Studies, 20, 7, pp. 2173-2188, (2019); Bartolini, Stefano, Happy for how long?

Method: In this study, we examined the mediators of the relationship between individualism measured at the country level and parental burnout measured at the individual level in 36 countries (16,059 parents). Results: The results revealed three mediating mechanisms, that is, self-discrepancies between socially prescribed and actual parental selves, high agency and self-directed socialization goals, and low parental task sharing, by which individualism leads to an increased risk of burnout among parents. Conclusion: The results confirm that the three mediators under consideration are all involved, and that mediation was higher for self-discrepancies between socially prescribed and actual parental selves, then parental task sharing, and lastly self-directed socialization goals. The results provide some important indications of how to prevent parental burnout at the societal level in Western countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Exhaustion; Fathers; Individualism; Mothers; Burnout; Child; Child Parent Relation; Epidemiology; Human; Professional Burnout; Socialization; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological; Child; Humans; Parents; Socialization","burnout; child; child parent relation; epidemiology; human; professional burnout; socialization; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological; Child; Humans; Parents; Socialization",,,IR and MM were supported by a Coordinated Research Grant from the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles in Belgium (ARC Grant n°19/24-100).

We examine how the experience of emotions like anger and disgust relate to the judged appropriateness of sanctions, in a pre-registered analysis of data from a large-scale study in 56 societies. Across the world, we find that individuals who experience anger and disgust over a norm violation are more likely to endorse confrontation, ostracism and, to a smaller extent, gossip. Moreover, we find that the experience of anger is consistently the strongest predictor of judgments of confrontation, compared to other emotions. Although the link between state-based emotions and judgments may seem universal, its strength varies across countries. Aligned with theoretical predictions, this link is stronger in societies, and among individuals, that place higher value on individual autonomy. Thus, autonomy values may increase the role that emotions play in guiding judgments of social sanctions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Anger; Article; Controlled Study; Cultural Anthropology; Decision Making; Disgust; Emotion; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Ostracism; Prediction; Social Norm,anger; article; controlled study; cultural anthropology; decision making; disgust; emotion; human; major clinical study; male; ostracism; prediction; social norm,,,"This research was funded by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond) [P17-0030:1].

The study found that CPEL reduces the dropout rate of children by 12%. However, the effect is minor, especially when compared with the impact of family income and parents' education.

However, numerous studies on RHS's impact on private modes’ usage provide inconclusive evidence. Notably, few studies have analyzed RHS's impacts on modal changes in the context of motorcycle-based societies. This study attempts to identify the critical factors affecting RHS users’ private mode usage (private cars and motorcycles) in response to RHS appearance in Hanoi, Vietnam, a motorcycle-based society. Two empirical analyses were performed with sample data of 642 individuals collected from face-to-face interviews using paper-based questionnaire sheets in Hanoi from December 19 to 21, 2020. The first analysis employed a linear regression model to explain the changes in individuals’ private mode usage before and after RHS adoption. The second analysis estimated a logistic regression model to examine an individual's private mode choice when RHS are unavailable. Robustness tests were also performed. The results revealed that RHS users’ future vehicle ownership intentions, reasons for using RHS instead of private modes, motorcycle ownership, and public transport usage significantly reduce the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. The reasons for using RHS rather than private modes were found not strong enough to make an essential change to reduce the frequency of private modes usage. The results also showed there is a difference between the RHS's impacts on motorcycle use and car use. They suggested that policy makers should be aware of the unique factors in motorcycle-based societies such as Hanoi when formulating urban transportation strategies. Finally, the findings further supported an idea that multivariate analyses are more suitable than the simple descriptive statistics method to understand how the motivation for using RHS influences the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Modal Choice; Motorcycle-based Society; Private Mode; Ride-hailing Service,,,,Funding text 1: This study was financially supported by the Kajima Foundation’s International Joint Research Grant.; Funding text 2: We appreciate Dr. Saksith Chalermpong and Dr. Phathinan Thaithatkul (Chulalongkorn University) for sharing the basic design of the questionnaire survey of ride-hailing services.

A judicious combination of either approach in both classroom pedagogy has long been advocated by both theorists and veteran practitioners. However, the authors, when working as teacher trainers, had observed that many ESP teachers reverted almost wholly to bottom-up approaches in their classroom practices. The present study seeks to understand whether or not this perception is accurate and what justifications and/or explanations might be put forward in favour of adopting either approach in ESP milieus. With the participation of 14 ESP teachers in Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam, the study was conducted using a semi-structured written questionnaire which was followed by an open-ended live interview. Emerging and significant themes were then identified and codified by the authors, utilizing a reflective ethnographic approach. Among the most significant findings were 1) that teachers often failed to apply aspects of their training as language teachers into their own classrooms and 2) that the judicious application of either approach was more often performed unconsciously than as a result of any conscious methodological application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bottom-up/ Top-down Approaches; East Asia; Materials Design; Pedagogy; Teaching Methodology,,,,,"English for Specific Purposes, (1977); Shaping Written Knowledge the Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science, (1988); Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication Cognition Culture Power, (1995); Analysing Genre Language Use in Professional Settings, (1993); Bhatia, Vijay K., Integrating products, processes, purposes and participants in professional writing, pp. 21-39, (2014); Charles, Mirjaliisa, Language matters in global communication: Article based on ORA lecture, October 2006, Journal of Business Communication, 44, 3, pp. 260-282, (2007); Bargiela-Chiappini, Francesca, Business English, pp. 193-211, (2012); Developments in English for Specific Purposes, (1998); Feak, Christine B., ESP and Speaking, pp. 35-53, (2012); Flowerdew, John L., Action, content and identity in applied genre analysis for ESP, Language Teaching, 44, 4, pp. 516-528, (2011)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,14751585,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188215315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the level of anxiety and its associated factors among non-Japanese residents residing in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A web-based survey in 13 languages was conducted among non-Japanese residents living in Japan during the COVID-19 situation. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory assessed the level of anxiety–State (STAI-S) scores prorated from its six-item version. The multivariable logistic regression using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) method was performed to identify the associated factors of anxiety among participants. Results From January to March 2021, we collected 392 responses. A total of 357 valid responses were analyzed. 54.6% of participants suffered from clinically significant anxiety (CSA). In multivariable logistic model analysis, the CSA status or the high level of anxiety was associated with three factors, including having troubles/difficulties in learning or working, decreased sleep duration, and decreased overall physical health (p<0.05). Conclusion Our study suggests several possible risk factors of anxiety among non-Japanese residents living in Japan undergoing the COVID-19 pandemic, including the troubles or difficulties in learning or working, the decrease in sleep duration, and the decrease in overall physical health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",R Statistical Software Version 3.6.3 For Windows; Adult; Akaike Information Criterion; Anxiety; Article; Assessment Of Humans; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Emotion; Fear; Female; Health; Human; Human Experiment; Japan; Learning; Likert Scale; Male; Mental Health; Non Japanese People; Pandemic; Population Group; Questionnaire; Resident; Risk Factor; Sleep Time; Social Media; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; Working Time; Depression; Anxiety; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Risk Factors,adult; akaike information criterion; anxiety; Article; assessment of humans; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; emotion; fear; female; health; human; human experiment; Japan; learning; Likert scale; male; mental health; non japanese people; pandemic; population group; questionnaire; resident; risk factor; sleep time; social media; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; working time; depression; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Risk Factors,,,"This work was supported by the dormant deposits of Japan Network for Public Interest Activities (JANPIA), Japan.

The performance of legal text retrieval depends, to a large extent, on the representation of text, both query and legal documents. Based on good representations, a legal text retrieval model can effectively match the query to its relevant documents. Because legal documents often contain long articles and only some parts are relevant to queries, it is quite a challenge for existing models to represent such documents. In this paper, we study the use of attentive neural network-based text representation for statute law document retrieval. We propose a general approach using deep neural networks with attention mechanisms. Based on it, we develop two hierarchical architectures with sparse attention to represent long sentences and articles, and we name them Attentive CNN and Paraformer. The methods are evaluated on datasets of different sizes and characteristics in English, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Experimental results show that: (i) Attentive neural methods substantially outperform non-neural methods in terms of retrieval performance across datasets and languages; (ii) Pretrained transformer-based models achieve better accuracy on small datasets at the cost of high computational complexity while lighter weight Attentive CNN achieves better accuracy on large datasets; and (iii) Our proposed Paraformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COLIEE dataset, achieving the highest recall and F2 scores in the top-N retrieval task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Neural Networks; Global Attention; Hierarchical Representation; Legal Text Retrieval; Authentication; Deep Neural Networks; Information Retrieval; Natural Language Processing Systems; Text Processing; Document Retrieval; Global Attention; Hierarchical Representation; Legal Documents; Legal Questions; Legal Text Retrieval; Legal Texts; Question Answering; Text Retrieval; Text-processing; Large Dataset,Authentication; Deep neural networks; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Document Retrieval; Global attention; Hierarchical representation; Legal documents; Legal questions; Legal text retrieval; Legal texts; Question Answering; Text retrieval; Text-processing; Large dataset,,,"This work was supported by JSPS Kakenhi Grant Number 20K20406.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ threshold co-integration tests and a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model to study the asymmetric dynamics of ASEAN equity markets. The study’s data cover the 2009–2022 period for seven member states: Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Findings: The authors find evidence supporting co-integration relationships; adjustment toward equilibrium is asymmetric in the short run and symmetric in the long run for these countries. While co-movement in ASEAN equity markets seems encouraging for initiatives seeking to foster financial integration in regional economies, the benefits for international portfolio diversification appear to be neutralized. Originality/value: The issue of stock market integration is important among policymakers, investors and academics. This study examines the level of stock market integration in ASEAN during the 2009–2022 period. For this purpose, advanced co-integration techniques are applied to different frequencies of data (daily, weekly and monthly) for comparison and completeness. The empirical analysis of this study is conducted using the Enders and Siklos (2001) co-integration and threshold adjustment procedure.

However, along with their positive contributions, these projects have also brought significant social consequences, particularly for those who have been involuntarily displaced and resettled, including ethnic minorities. To shed light on this issue, this chapter discusses the spatial conditions at A Do village, one of the new resettlement areas where the Cotu ethnic minority residents have been relocated. These communities found themselves uprooted from their ancestral land due to the construction of the A Vuong hydropower plant. The construction of the plant greatly forced significant changes in their lives, and significant alterations in the village layout, housing type, living arrangements, and building materials between the old and new villages have profoundly impacted the locals' way of life. Residents have made necessary adjustments by constructing extensions to their homes and making changes in the utilization of living spaces. The residents' lifestyles and traditions were greatly impacted by the design of their new houses and environment, leading them to compromise to maintain their cultural values and lifestyle. Although the government aimed to provide better infrastructure and amenities, these changes impacted the preservation of Cotu cultural traditions. It is essential to strike a balance between the new development and cultural traditions right from the outset and to incorporate the knowledge and strengths of the residents along with the potential benefits and limitations of the new area. Close and effective communication with the affected communities and actively involving the residents in the planning process for the new living environment are highly important to ensure that their cultural practices and preferences are considered. The focus should be on providing support that builds a foundation for improvement in the future. To protect social capital and prevent the loss of traditions, all parties involved in community relocation projects must carefully consider the local society and culture during the planning and development of the new resettlement areas. The roles of stakeholders are crucial in facilitating the indigenous communities' transition into modernization while preserving their cultural heritage, and an integrated approach is required. This approach should support local resources, economy, traditional work, and income generation from the local culture, skills, and knowledge. Further, it should encourage pride, motivate cultural sharing among communities, and ensure that cultural identity remains intact. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cotu Ethnic Minority; Development-forced Displacement; Living Environment; Resettlement; Space Adjustment; Vietnam; Economic Analysis; Economic And Social Effects; Historic Preservation; Hydroelectric Power; Hydroelectric Power Plants; Cotu Ethnic Minority; Cultural Traditions; Development-forced Displacement; Ethnic Minorities; Hydropower Plants; Living Environment; Plant Project; Resettlement; Space Adjustment; Viet Nam; Rural Areas,Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Historic preservation; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Cotu ethnic minority; Cultural traditions; Development-forced displacement; Ethnic minorities; Hydropower plants; Living environment; Plant project; Resettlement; Space adjustment; Viet Nam; Rural areas,,,,"Gender Impact Assessment Report Get Rid of the Tight Shirt A Vuong Hydropower from A Gender Perspective Bao Cao Danh Gia Tac Dong Giai Thoat Chiec Ao Chat Tac Dong Cua Thuy Dien A Voong Tu Goc Nhin Giai, (2018); Risks and Reconstruction Experiences of Resettlers and Refugees, (2000); Hydro Nepal Journal of Water Energy and Environment, (2007); Dao, Nga, Dam development in Vietnam: The evolution of dam-induced resettlement policy, Water Alternatives, 3, 2, pp. 324-340, (2010); Google Maps Location of Pachepalanh New Resettlement Area, (2020); Dams Leave Farmers Landless and Hungry Online Vietnam Culture, (2009); Co Tu People in the Reform Era Nguoi Co Tu Thoi Doi Mai Online Petro Times, (2018); Singer, Jane, Reducing reservoir impacts and improving outcomes for dam-forced resettlement: Experiences in central Vietnam, Lakes and Reservoirs: Science, Policy and Management for Sustainable Use, 19, 3, pp. 225-235, (2014); Journal of Architecture and Planning Transactions of Aij, (2016); Life of the Katu People After Resettlement at A Vuong Hydropower Plant Current Situation and Raised Issues Ddi Song Cua Nguoi Katu Sau Tal Dinh Co Thuy Dien A Voong Thuc Trang Va Nhung Van De Dat Ra, (2014)",,COPAL Publishing Group,,,,,,,9.78938E+12,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189064344,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. Here, we tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task. Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions’ effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior—several interventions even reduced tree planting. Last, the effects of each intervention differed depending on people’s initial climate beliefs. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences and target behaviors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Behavioral Research; Information Analysis; Information Dissemination; Reforestation; Behavioral Science; Behaviour Changes; Behavioural Tasks; Climate Mitigations; Global Behaviors; Information Sharing; Intervention Effectiveness; Most Likely; Policy Support; Tree Plantings; Climate Change; Behavior; Behavioral Science; Climate Change; Human; Policy; Behavioral Sciences; Climate Change; Humans; Intention; Policy,Behavioral research; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Reforestation; Behavioral science; Behaviour changes; Behavioural tasks; Climate mitigations; Global behaviors; Information sharing; Intervention effectiveness; Most likely; Policy support; Tree plantings; Climate change; behavior; behavioral science; climate change; human; policy; Behavioral Sciences; Climate Change; Humans; Intention; Policy,,,"Funding: this work was supported by Google Jigsaw grant (to M.Vl., K.c.d., and J.J.V.B.), Swiss national Science Foundation P400PS_190997 (to K.c.d.), dutch Research council grant 7934 (to K.l.v.d.B.), european Union grant no. id 776608 (to K.l.v.d.B.), John templeton Foundation grant 61378 (to M.A.), the national council for Scientific and technological development grant (to A.A.), christ church college Research centre grant (to M.A.J.A.), david Phillips Fellowship grant BB/R010668/2 (to M.A.J.A.), Jacobs Foundation Fellowship (to M.A.J.A.), dFG grant project no. 390683824 (to M.A.d., P.Ba., and B.B.), nYUAd research funds (to J.J.B.), the Swiss Federal Office of energy through the energy, economy, and Society program grant number: Si/502093-01 (to S.Be.), the Belgian national Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FnRS) PdR 0253.19 (to P.Be.), Fund for scientific development at the Faculty of Psychology at SWPS University in Warsaw (to O.Bi.), Radboud University Behavioral Science institute (to d.n.M.B.),","Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report Contribution of Working Groups I II and III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2023); Ivanova, Diana, Quantifying the potential for climate change mitigation of consumption options, Environmental Research Letters, 15, 9, (2020); Gifford, Robert, Behavioral dimensions of climate change: Drivers, responses, barriers, and interventions, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 2, 6, pp. 801-827, (2011); Otto, Ilona M., Social tipping dynamics for stabilizing Earth’s climate by 2050, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 5, pp. 2354-2365, (2020); Allcott, Hunt, Behavior and energy policy, Science, 327, 5970, pp. 1204-1205, (2010); Carattini, Stefano, How to win public support for a global carbon tax, Nature, 565, 7739, pp. 289-291, (2019); Jenny, Mirjam Annina, Large-scale behavioural data are key to climate policy, Nature Human Behaviour, 6, 11, pp. 1444-1447, (2022); Composto, Jordana W., Effectiveness of behavioural interventions to reduce household energy demand: A scoping review, Environmental Research Letters, 17, 6, (2022); Nisa, Claudia F., Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials testing behavioural interventions to promote household action on climate change, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Jones, Charlotte, The Future is Now: Reducing Psychological Distance to Increase Public Engagement with Climate Change, Risk Analysis, 37, 2, pp. 331-341, (2017)",,American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,,23752548,,,38324680,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85184670116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An integrated approach (both qualitative and quantitative analysis, conducted through field and questionnaire surveys) was used in the Karura Forest Reserve, located in the northern central part of Nairobi City. Data sources developed from the questionnaire survey were analyzed via the application of ecological approaches to evaluate different ecosystem services being generated based on the local knowledge generated by the residents living within the forest areas. Results suggested that both local people and rural communities depend on this forest, with indigenous and exotic species contributing to producing various ecosystem services, primarily provision and regulatory services such as food, fodder, fuel, and medicine. These ecosystem services are necessary for livelihood support and keeping forest usage diverse. Moreover, it also contributed to the enhancement of social bonding, peace and happiness, and women’s empowerment by creating more jobs, reducing thefts/crimes, and increasing opportunities for women to take key roles in decision-making. Exotic elements, like Eucalyptus, introduced in the forest reserve provided the stakeholders with benefits owing to their rapid growth. The number of types of forest resource utilization (i.e., use-richness) in indigenous and exotic elements were 10 and 7, respectively. It is still unclear whether the indigenous/native trees adopted in the above-mentioned tree planting activities will bring the same benefits as, or more than, those of exotic species. In consideration of the fact that the prime objective of the reforestation activities is to make local people’s lives more prosperous, it is important to conduct an assessment to clarify the situations of natural resources and the related local needs among the target communities. Then, it is required to properly maintain ecosystem services based on the appropriate local ecological knowledge and to promote well-balanced vegetation management coexisting with indigenous and exotic elements. These findings will contribute to providing forest managers and users with incentives to promote a well-balanced landscape management between indigenous and exotic vegetation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Baral, Himlal, A proposed framework for assessing ecosystem goods and services from planted forests, Ecosystem Services, 22, pp. 260-268, (2016); Green Belt Movement of Kenya with Wanjira Matai, (2015); Eigenbrod, Felix, The impact of projected increases in urbanization on ecosystem services, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 278, 1722, pp. 3201-3208, (2011); Fedele, Giacomo, Reducing risks by transforming landscapes: Cross-scale effects of land-use changes on ecosystem services, PLOS ONE, 13, 4, (2018); Ferreira, Lucianna Marques Rocha, Impact of the Urbanisation Process in the Availability of Ecosystem Services in a Tropical Ecotone Area, Ecosystems, 22, 2, pp. 266-282, (2019); Green Belt Movement Annual Report 2016, (2016); Graydon, Nicola, From tiny seeds, Ecologist, 35, 2, (2005); Green Belt Movement Sharing the Approach and the Experience, (2004); Eco Habitat, (2006); Hunt, Kathleen P., It's More Than Planting Trees, It's Planting Ideas"": Ecofeminist Praxis in the Green Belt Movement, Southern Communication Journal, 79, 3, pp. 235-249, (2014)",,Taylor and Francis,,,,,,,9781040273838; 9781032565354,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213185112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Men and women in 15 countries (NTOTAL = 4701) completed self-report measures assessing self-esteem and the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-defeating, and self-enhancing. Each of the country samples had self-esteem averages at or above the midpoint of the scale, but did vary. The samples from Colombia and Serbia had the highest self-esteem values and Russia had the lowest. For all of the country samples, with the exception of Russia, the multiple regression results demonstrated that a greater level of the self-enhancing humor style positively predicted higher self-esteem scores. As the self-enhancing humor style involves improving one’s mood with humor, the results suggest that for the majority of the participants, self-enhancing humor styles also help to increase self-esteem. The results are discussed both within countries and across the samples. In particular, the unique finding that not a self-enhancing humor style but an aggressive humor style predicts self-esteem in the Russian sample is discussed. The chapter ends with a discussion of how humor styles correlate with mental health indicators and how the understanding of humor style profiles are related to well-being across countries adds to the global understanding of individual differences. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Social Science Research Council Bulletin, (1942); Baumeister, Roy F., Does High Self-Esteem Cause Better Performance, Interpersonal Success, Happiness, or Healthier Lifestyles?, Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, 1, pp. 1-44, (2003); World Applied Sciences Journal, (2007); Brown, Jonathon D., The three faces of self-esteem, pp. 1-9, (2013); Burisch, Matthias, Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits, American Psychologist, 39, 3, pp. 214-227, (1984); Chen, Guohai, A comparison of humor styles, coping humor, and mental health between Chinese and Canadian university students, Humor, 20, 3, pp. 215-234, (2007); Erickson, Sarah J., Adolescent humor and its relationship to coping, defense strategies, psychological distress, and well-being, Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 37, 3, pp. 255-271, (2007); Ford, Thomas E., Personality, humor styles and happiness: Happy people have positive humor styles, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 320-337, (2016); Fox, Claire Louise, Longitudinal associations between humor styles and psychosocial adjustment in adolescence, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 377-389, (2016); Studia Psychologiczne, (2011)",,Springer International Publishing,,,,,,,9783031522871; 9783031522888,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205640381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research and its outcomes presented here focus especially on diverse cases from emerging countries in East Asia, where local companies face similar technological change. The pandemic has seriously changed people’s lives and affected the development of society as a whole, while digital technologies have become even more greatly in demand. Those are very difficult to fit into traditional management models created decades ago, however. For the successful implementation of such a transition, new paradigms, models, and technologies for the transformation of control systems are needed. To meet that need, a new paradigm to bring about innovation under the new knowledge transformation system is required. This book presents the experiences of beginning such a knowledge transformation inEast Asian countries. Despite the fact that the countries are in the same geographical region, their experiences are quite diverse, determined by cultural, historical, religious, and psychological factors. These differences appear not only in such important areas as R&D processes, but also in production, finance, HR management, and marketing. Readers will find innovative solutions for the transformation of management in the new knowledge transformation system that is the focus of this book. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business Eco-systems; Digital Hybrid Value Chain; Inclusive Business Innovation; It-bpo; It-business Process Outsourcing; It-led Business Management; New Industrial Development Path,,,,,,,Springer Nature,,,,,,,9789819973002; 9789819973019,,,English,Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205607096,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adding to the burden of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCD) are becoming more prevalent due to socio-economic development that changes lifestyles in an aging population resulting in significant increases in life expectancy. The shifting disease burden drives healthcare systems to change accordingly to provide an adequate response. In the meantime, unsolved problems of inequality, shortage of medical personnel, and high prevalence of infectious diseases remain significant, putting massive pressure on the limited resources of healthcare systems in LICs and LMICs. This is where digital health brings its promising potential, firstly to better understand the disease burden itself for an accurate conception of the health risks for the population, secondly to develop new solutions that will improve the efficiency of the current healthcare ecosystem, alleviating constraints and overcoming the lack of resources, and finally to provide better health outcomes for individuals as a customer-centric solution. Applications like health information technology (health IT) with electronic health records (EHR) offer an inclusive perspective on a patient’s total health and access to all healthcare providers, insurers, and other healthcare stakeholders. Mobile applications and wearables empower and engage patients in self-care management while real-time monitoring, collection, and exchange of their health status provide a continuous image of their health. Such solutions used together can build a strong history of a patient’s health status, and the data can then be used in conjunction with other data, such as genomics, etc., for early detection of many kinds of diseases, providing space and time for rapid treatment through personalized and precise medicine that works better for each individual, going towards more preventive care and wellbeing, which is particularly effective in managing NCDs. On the other hand, telehealth, using digital information and communication technologies, has already proven its usefulness in dealing with communicable diseases, as recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, while improving healthcare access and cost for rural, remote, and marginalized communities. The applications vary and are constantly updated as new technologies emerge, with numerous interrelated factors driving the changes.Shifting Disease Burden This chapter studies LMICs in particular as they are the most strained and impacted by the double burdenDouble Burden and provide us with insights into the challenges and the opportunities that emerge with digital health solutions as contenders. Amongst LMICs, Vietnam is an interesting case due to its rapid socio-economic growth that brings homegrown solutions to the local and foreign markets, while facing important health and inequality issues. As such, in dealing with the double burdenDouble Burden and particularly for LMICs, digital health promises to be the answer for gaining equitable and universal access to high-quality healthcare that is both cost-effective and affordable. In highlighting this, indicative examples will be presented to illustrate the point. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Digital Health; Double Burden; Health Ecosystems; Low- And-middle Income Countries (lmic); Shifting Disease Burden,,,,,undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Digital Health in Vietnam A Guide to Market,,Springer,,,,,,25233084; 25233092,,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204201512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite such national efforts, faculty members’ study abroad outcomes are yet to be assessed in depth. The chapter reveals statistically significant differences between the study abroad (SA) and study at home (SH) groups in terms of impact on education, research, and management activities. The SA group made notable contributions, particularly in innovating education modules and expanding international education activities. In terms of research, the research skills and methodologies acquired while studying abroad enabled them to be more productive through research outputs. Moreover, university management was impacted by their SA experiences through the choices of strategies employed once they returned to Vietnamese universities. Conversely, some participants experienced adverse impacts on career development once back in Vietnam, such as reverse culture shock. Overall, the chapter demonstrates the positive contribution of SA to knowledge, skills, and value development in cultivating human capital for national development, as intended by national policies and programs since the Doi Moi era. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Education And Research Activities; Higher Education; Internationalization; Study Abroad Experience; Vietnamese Faculty Members,,,,"After receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in Vietnam, Dr. Le began looking for opportunities to study abroad. She received scholarship offers from the Japanese and Australian governments as well as the US Fulbright Foundation. The first scholarship letter arrived from Japan, so she chose Japan as her SA destination. She enrolled at a national university in Japan for an MA in area studies, a field in which the academic community is very diverse. She took classes with not only Japanese professors but also German, Canadian, and French academics, and the classrooms were filled with international students like Dr. Le. She learned that the pedagogy at her Japanese university differed greatly from what she was used to in Vietnam. In particular, she noticed that the courses in Japan were largely constructed around discussion and presentations rather than lectures. In addition, assessment was very different, as the students were required to submit essays and reports, and give presentations, while examinations were more common in Vietnam.","Ackers, Louise, Moving people and knowledge: Scientific mobility in the European Union, International Migration, 43, 5, pp. 99-131, (2005); Era Conference an Enlarged Europe for Researchers, (2001); Journal of International and Comparative Education, (2017); Student and Skilled Labour Mobility in the Asia Pacific Region Reflecting the Emerging Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2023); 50 Years of US Study Abroad Students Japan as the Gateway to Asia and Beyond, (2019); Asada, Sarah R., Study abroad and knowledge diplomacy: increasing awareness and connectivity to the host country, host region, and world, Compare, 51, 4, pp. 580-595, (2021); Asada, Sarah R., Going beyond the binary of internationalisation: how international faculty programmes enable institutions to function at home and abroad, Globalisation, Societies and Education, 22, 4, pp. 707-719, (2024); Boni, Alejandra, Education for Global Citizenship at Universities: Potentialities of Formal and Informal Learning Spaces to Foster Cosmopolitanism, Journal of Studies in International Education, 21, 1, pp. 22-38, (2017); International Service Learning Conceptual Frameworks and Research, (2011); Campbell, Anne C., ‘Giving back’ to one’s country following an international higher education scholarship: comparing in-country and expatriate alumni perceptions of engagement in social and economic change in Moldova, Compare, 50, 4, pp. 573-591, (2020)",,Springer,,,,,,25233084; 25233092,,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201803524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It synthesizes the findings of the case studies presented in Chaps. 4 through 13, adding new comparative perspectives, such as country of origin and country of destination. Key findings are, firstly, that faculty study abroad experiences have positive impacts on academics’ subsequent teaching and research activities, particularly in the context of universities’ expanding international engagement, which has recently gained momentum in Southeast Asia. Secondly, the impacts vary in magnitude, with Vietnam and Cambodia showing more pronounced effects than Malaysia and Indonesia. This suggests that as domestic graduate education progresses, the impacts of study abroad tend to diminish. Striking a balance between promoting domestic graduate programs and strengthening internationalization through faculty experience abroad becomes critical. Finally, our research underscores the unique strengths of different host countries. Some destinations, such as Japan and the Netherlands, excel at facilitating faculty research activities, while others, such as France and the United States, are notable for fostering faculty teaching skills. Diversifying study abroad destinations allows universities to tap into a wide range of strengths, enriching the overall academic landscape. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Academic Mobility; Faculty Members; Higher Education Internationalization; Impact; Southeast Asia; Study Abroad,,,,,"International Educator, (2000); Teachers College Record, (1981); Decline of the Guru the Academic Profession in Developing and Middle Income Countries, (2003); Asian Universities Historical Perspectives and Contemporary Challenges, (2004); Altbach, Philip G., Globalization and the University: Realities in an Unequal World, Springer International Handbooks of Education, 18, pp. 121-139, (2007); Altbach, Philip G., World class worldwide: Transforming research universities in Asia and Latin America, pp. 1-323, (2007); Japan as the Gateway to Asia and Beyond the Long Term Impacts of US Undergraduate Study Abroad Experiences Doctoral Dissertation, (2017); undefined; International Service Learning Conceptual Frameworks and Research, (2011); Globalization and Transnational Academic Mobility the Experiences of Chinese Academic Returnees, (2017)",,Springer,,,,,,25233084; 25233092,,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201796299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the existing literature has primarily underestimated such borrowers’ opinions of these services, especially from a comparative standpoint. In addition, previous studies have also neglected the implications for personal financial and accounting education and assistance, in general, and in Vietnam, in particular. Therefore, this study explored the correlations among motivations, perceived benefits, perceived risks, perceived trust, and customer intentions toward P2P borrowing and pawnbroking in Vietnam. Specifically, this study collected data from 295 and 314 students at a national university in Hanoi. A comparison analysis of the evaluations of the two samples revealed that the students perceived P2P lending to be more favorable. Furthermore, regression analyses suggested that motivation could significantly affect the students’ intentions to use and recommend P2P lending and pawnbroking, although the impacts were more prominent in the P2P model. Perceived risks and trust significantly mediated the association between motivations and intentions; the effects of the former were negative, while these of the latter were positive.

The adverse impacts of extreme weather events, particularly drought and water scarcity, have inflicted severe consequences on rice production across diverse regions, imperiling both the livelihoods of farmers and the nation's food security. While international aid is crucial, involving farmers in co-financing irrigation water services is essential for addressing these challenges in the long run. This study employs a blended approach encompassing quantitative and qualitative methodologies to investigate the determinants influencing farmers' willingness to participate in co-financing irrigation water services. Data were meticulously gathered through direct interviews with 289 farmers in An Giang province within the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The findings underscore that the majority of respondents (86.16%) reported encountering water-related stresses in rice production, with 76.47% experiencing productivity losses attributable to extreme weather events. The results of the binary logistic regression model reveal significant factors associated with a farmer's decision to engage in co-financing irrigation services, including household income, participation in non-farm employment, farmers' perceptions of water scarcity, the adverse impact of water scarcity on rice yields, and the assessment of associated risks. Based on these discernments, we offer several policy recommendations aimed at facilitating the efficacious implementation of the irrigation water service co-financing initiative. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Co-financing Irrigation Services; Mekong Delta; Vietnam; Water Stresses; Willingness To Pay,,,,This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 504.05-2020.302.,"Agricultural Social Economic Journal, (2022); Akter, Sonia, Household perceptions of climate change and preferences for mitigation action: The case of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in Australia, Climatic Change, 109, 3-4, pp. 417-436, (2011); Estimating Farmers Willingness to Pay for Improved Irrigation an Economic Study of the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme in Northern Ghana, (2012); Antwi-Agyei, Philip, Predictors of access to and willingness to pay for climate information services in north-eastern Ghana: A gendered perspective, Environmental Development, 37, (2021); Arikan, Gizem, Public attitudes towards climate change: A cross-country analysis, British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 23, 1, pp. 158-174, (2021); Bertolini, Guido, One model, several results: the paradox of the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for the logistic regression model., Journal of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, 5, 4, pp. 251-253, (2000); Biswas, Durba, Farmers' Willingness to Pay for Improved Irrigation Water - A Case Study of Malaprabha Irrigation Project in Karnataka, India, Water Economics and Policy, 1, 1, (2015); Bradley, Graham L., The role of climate change risk perception, response efficacy, and psychological adaptation in pro-environmental behavior: A two nation study, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 68, (2020); Brox, James A., Willingness to pay for water quality and supply enhancements in the grand river watershed, Canadian Water Resources Journal, 21, 3, pp. 275-288, (1996); Bui, Nuong Thi, Willingness to Pay for Improved Urban Domestic Water Supply System: The Case of Hanoi, Vietnam, Water (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022)",,Firenze University Press,,,,,,22402802,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197929835,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of ethnic minorities who have jobs in industry, construction, and services is still limited. Moreover, due to harsh climate conditions, limited resources, poor market access, low education level, lack of investment capital for production, and inadequate policies, job opportunities in the off-farm and non-farm activities are very limited among ethnic minority areas. This paper assessed the contribution of livelihood diversification activities to poverty reduction of ethnic minority households in Son La Province of Vietnam. The analysis was based on the data using three stages sampling procedure of 240 ethnic minority households in Son La Province. The finding showed that the livelihood diversification activities had positively significant contribution to poverty reduction of ethnic minority households in Son La Province. In addition, the factors positively affecting the livelihood choices of ethnic minority households in Son La Province of Vietnam are education level, labor size, access to credit, membership of associations, support policies, vocational training, and district. Thus, improving ethnic minority householder’s knowledge through formal educational and training, expanding availability of accessible infrastructure, and enhancing participation of social/political associations were recommended as possible policy interventions to diversify livelihood activities so as to mitigate the level of poverty in the study area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ethnic Minority Households; Factors; Livelihood Diversification; Poverty Reduction; Vietnam,,,,,"International Association of Agricultural Economists Iaae 2012 Conference, (2012); Impact of Accessibility on the Range of Livelihood Options Available to Farm Households in Mountainous Areas of Northern Viet Nam, (2002); Ansoms, An, A quantitative analysis of poverty and livelihood profiles: The case of rural Rwanda, Food Policy, 35, 6, pp. 584-598, (2010); Sustainable Livelihoods Lessons from Early Experience, (1999); Barrett, Christopher B., Income diversification, poverty traps and policy shocks in Côte d'Ivoire and Kenya, Food Policy, 26, 4, pp. 367-384, (2001); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2010); Journal of Economics and Sustainable Development, (2017); African Studies, (2003); Poverty Vulnerability and Social Protection in Vietnam Selected Issues, (2011); Baulch, Bob, Decomposing the Ethnic Gap in Rural Vietnam, 1993-2004, Oxford Development Studies, 40, 1, pp. 87-117, (2012)",,"EnPress Publisher, LLC",,,,,,25727931; 25727923,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197613008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Behavior analysis reveals both general and detailed patterns in the interaction of customers with a store’s items and other people, providing store managers with insight into customer preferences. Several solutions aim to utilize this data by recognizing specific behaviors through statistical visualization. However, current approaches are limited to the analysis of small customer behavior sets, utilizing conventional methods to detect behaviors. They do not use deep learning techniques such as deep neural networks, which are powerful methods in the field of computer vision. Furthermore, these methods provide limited figures when visualizing the behavioral data acquired by the system. In this study, we propose a framework that includes three primary parts: mathematical modeling of customer behaviors, behavior analysis using an efficient deep learning-based system, and individual and group behavior visualization.

Based on a sample of 800 individuals who visited Da Nang, Vietnam between July and August 2023, trends in the barriers and benefits related to bike-sharing service from tourists’ point-of-view were explored. The results show that bike-sharing is appreciated for many reasons, notably for its fun/relaxing, cost saving, ease of city exploration, and promotion of better physical and mental health. However, bike-sharing services are considerably less likely to be viewed as options for faster transportation to a destination or reducing traffic hazards. Notably, eighty-six percent of non-riders indicated contentment with their existing transportation options and a lack of interest in bike-sharing services, a proportion significantly higher than any other group. Predictably, barriers related to the availability of bike-sharing and infrastructure, such as lack of sufficient number of shared bikes, far destination, and poor road conditions were notably more likely to be selected by one-time riders. The results are also evident that a significant portion of tourists is willing to pay to enhance their tourist experience with a bike-sharing service. On average, tourists were willing to pay $0.92 per hour (with a standard deviation of $0.24). This amount reflects the tourists’ recognition of the value added to their mode experience. These findings suggest that bike-sharing service play a significant role in fulfilling an essential transportation niche and have the potential to contribute to enhance tourists’ experience. Efforts aimed at addressing barriers associated with bike-sharing usage could further enhance their contribution to improve tourist satisfaction and boost attraction demand. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Barriers; Benefits; Bike-sharing Service; Tourism Context; Willingness To Pay,,,,,"Bai, Lu, Effect of environmental awareness on electric bicycle users’ mode choices, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 82, (2020); Bakogiannis, Efthimios, Monitoring the first dockless bike sharing system in Greece: Understanding user perceptions, usage patterns and adoption barriers, Research in Transportation Business and Management, 33, (2019); Becken, Susanne, Distance Models for new Zealand International Tourists and the Role of Transport Prices, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 3, pp. 303-320, (2011); Economic Benefits of Capital Bikeshare A Focus on Users and Businesses, (2014); Çelebi, Dilay, Bicycle sharing system design with capacity allocations, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 114, pp. 86-98, (2018); Chu, Junhong, The last mile matters: Impact of dockless bike sharing on subway housing price premium, Management Science, 67, 1, pp. 297-316, (2021); Journal of Public Transportation, (2009); Drius, Mita, Tackling challenges for Mediterranean sustainable coastal tourism: An ecosystem service perspective, Science of the Total Environment, 652, pp. 1302-1317, (2019); Durán-Román, José Luis, Tourists' willingness to pay to improve sustainability and experience at destination, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 19, (2021); Fishman, Elliot, Barriers and facilitators to public bicycle scheme use: A qualitative approach, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 15, 6, pp. 686-698, (2012)",,"EnPress Publisher, LLC",,,,,,25727931; 25727923,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196917926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bus drivers who perceived a higher presence of motorcycles and more dangerous interactions among vehicles were less likely to participate in VDB. Those who perceived motorcyclists as aggressive, road users’ traffic habits as unsafe, and bus routes’ punctuality and organisation as very strict were more likely to engage in VDB.

Although private financing schemes, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and land value capture, have been considered intensively, they have yet to produce adequate private capital flows to infrastructure projects due to a lack of incentives for private investors. Against the background, this paper proposes a new financing mechanism in which governments might divert some of the increased tax revenue from the spillover effects of newly constructed infrastructures to fund the private sector through grants or subsidies. The empirical work in Vietnam shows a significant increase in tax revenues after completing two expressways, supporting our idea about spillover effects, which includes small-and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development. This study’s results suggest that spillover effects can bring new opportunities for governments and multilateral development banks (MDBs) to implement infrastructure projects with greater private sector involvement in the region. It also proposes some financial schemes, such as land capture and financing for business startups, including SMEs, to enhance the spillover effects of infrastructure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Infrastructure; Private Financing; Spillover Effect; Vietnam,,,,"Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors appreciate the valuable comments provided by two anonymous reviewers, Alberto Isgut, Hamza Ali Malik, Oliver Paddison, Tientip Subhanij, Yusuke Tateno and Clevo Wilson that enhance the quality of this paper.

Organic waste has been recognized as a valuable resource; however, organic waste treatment remains a global challenge in the 21st century. State-of-the-art treatment technologies designed for organic waste to combat resource depletion and mitigate global warming are vital. Organic waste streams generated by industries, agriculture, and municipal solid waste including human waste are the major sources of waste that pose environmental issues. The application of green technology for organic waste treatment is a sustainable approach to mitigating climate change and conserving our depleting resources. Emerging green technologies such as fermentation, anaerobic digestion, vermicomposting, and bioremediation are widely utilized in transforming organic waste into sustainable resources. Such valuable resources include bioplastics, biofuels, and biofertilizers. A sustainable approach in organic waste management by integrating green technology is a close-loop method, which supports a circular economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Abbassi-Guendouz, Amel, Total solids content drives high solid anaerobic digestion via mass transfer limitation, Bioresource Technology, 111, pp. 55-61, (2012); Acosta-Cárdenas, Alejandro, Sugarcane molasses and vinasse as a substrate for polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production, DYNA (Colombia), 85, 206, pp. 220-225, (2018); Adnan, Amir Izzuddin, Technologies for biogas upgrading to biomethane: A review, Bioengineering, 6, 4, (2019); Int J Food Sci Agric, (2021); Ahmadi-Moghadam, Mehdi, Data on biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons using co-composting of cow manure/oily drill wastes, Data in Brief, 9, pp. 723-726, (2016); Ahmed, Shams Forruque, Recent developments in physical, biological, chemical, and hybrid treatment techniques for removing emerging contaminants from wastewater, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 416, (2021); Alewell, C., Global phosphorus shortage will be aggravated by soil erosion, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); M Alshehrei, Fatimah, Vermicomposting: A management tool to mitigate solid waste, Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences, 28, 6, pp. 3284-3293, (2021); Alvarez, Jose M., Morpho-physiological plant quality when biochar and vermicompost are used as growing media replacement in urban horticulture, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 34, pp. 175-180, (2018); Ameen, Fuad, Improving the efficiency of vermicomposting of polluted organic food wastes by adding biochar and mangrove fungi, Chemosphere, 286, (2022)",,CRC Press,,,,,,,9781040004302; 9781032439075,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194019638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Theoretical framework: The literature about the nighttime economy in developed contexts was reviewed to guide this study. Method/design/approach: Two exploratory studies were implemented. The first one involved the qualitative analysis of user-generated content. The second one was related to an analysis of data gathered via a structured survey. Results and conclusion: The qualitative analysis of public opinions (n = 538) revealed the positive and negative aspects of the perceived impacts. The quantitative survey (n = 352) exposed the hidden elements of the perceived impacts, including the economic, sociocultural, environmental, and health impacts. Research implications: The differences in findings between this study and the prior research were highlighted to expand the literature on the nighttime economy. Implications for local administrators when projecting and managing this new economic activity were also discussed. Originality/value: The binary and multidimensional natures of nighttime economy impacts are simultaneously taken into account to enrich the literature on these particular issues. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Binary; Impacts; Multidimension; Nighttime Economy,,,,,"Top Sites in Vietnam, (2021); Anand, Anupam, Pandemic induced changes in economic activity around African protected areas captured through night-time light data, Remote Sensing, 13, 2, pp. 1-15, (2021); Anitha, Sundari, A Balancing Act: Agency and Constraints in University Students’ Understanding of and Responses to Sexual Violence in the Night-Time Economy, Violence Against Women, 27, 11, pp. 2043-2065, (2021); Ashton, Kathryn, Developing a framework for managing the night-time economy in Wales: a Health Impact Assessment approach, Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal, 36, 1, pp. 81-89, (2018); Ayres, Tammy Colleen, Bars, drugs and football thugs: Alcohol, cocaine use and violence in the night time economy among english football firms, Criminology and Criminal Justice, 12, 1, pp. 83-100, (2012); Brands, Jelle, What are you looking at?

However, there remain competing approaches to the governance of low-skilled labor migration; that is, the economic theory and the rights-based approach. By utilizing the labor migration between Vietnam and Japan under the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP), this article reveals the limitations of these two approaches in governing the migration of low-skilled workers. Moreover, through examining the Memorandum of Cooperation on the Technical Intern Training Program signed by the Vietnamese and Japanese governments in 2017 and its contribution to the TITP, this article suggests that to regulate labor migration properly, it is essential to uphold the rights-based approach and consider labor migration as a transnational issue that should be addressed at the international level; that is, through the bilateral or multilateral instruments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",International Law; Japan; Low-skilled Labor Migration; Technical Intern Training Program; Transnational Problem; Vietnam,,,,,"Final Report on the Ideal Form of Technical Intern Training Program and Specified Skilled Worker System, (2023); Nihon Rodo Kenkyu Zasshi Japanese Journal of Labour Studies, (2018); Japan Immigration Control Policy Foundation and Transition, (2010); Rupo Ginojisshusei Reportage on Technical Intern Trainees, (2020); Proceedings of the Consultation on Labor Migration from Vietnam to Japan, (2019); International Labor Migration from Vietnam to Asian Countries Process Experiences and Impact, (2010); Saga University Economic Review, (2021); Low Skilled Workers and Bilateral Regional and Unilateral Initiatives Lessons for the Gats Mode 4 Negotiations and Other Agreements, (2008); Return Skilled and Business Migration and Social Transformation, (2002); Labor Migration from Vietnam Issues of Policy and Practice, (2008)",,Brill Academic Publishers,,,,,,19426720; 10752846,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191579431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aligned with the SVT framework, these findings emphasize the potential risk of undermining social cohesion when tourism overlooks local realities and norms. This research underscores the significance of adopting a community development perspective, offering insights to assess tourism’s impact on the social fabric.

Empirical evidence supports that the FE process would act as a mediator from input, customer or supplier market knowledge to output, organisational performance (including the success of new product development (NPD), quality, and customer satisfaction). Notably, customer market knowledge and supplier market knowledge play the primary source in the FE process in Western and Eastern countries.

It focuses on the distinct impacts of motorcycle-based RHS (MRHS) and car-based RHS (CRHS) on user behaviors. By applying multinomial logit and bivariate probit regression analyses to data from 500 RHS users gathered in March 2023, the study reveals that increases in income and personal vehicle ownership have contrasting effects on MRHS and CRHS usage. Notably, MRHS usage is positively associated with employing RHS as a feeder mode to metro stations, while CRHS usage demonstrates a negative correlation. Furthermore, the study establishes a user preference for MRHS over CRHS during peak traffic times.

Previous studies have intensively investigated factors influencing opportunism but overfocusing on the organisational level. Recently, supply chain researchers have called for identifying factors influencing opportunism at the individual level to gain a more comprehensive understanding of opportunism. Based on transaction cost theory, resource dependence theory, and boundary spanning theory, this study seeks to advance the emerging research stream on opportunism at the individual level by investigating how buyer agents’ boundary spanning capabilities and firms’ long–term relationship orientation can help manage supplier agents’ opportunism. Using a cross–sectional data set of 406 buyer agents from manufacturing companies collected from February to April 2021 in Japan, we tested a set of hypotheses through regression and conditional process analyses. Our findings suggest that buyer agents’ strategic communication and firms’ long–term relationship orientation are critical factors that reduce supplier agents’ opportunism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Boundary Spanning Capability; Inter–firm Relationship; Japan; Long–term Orientation; Opportunism,,,,,"Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, (1976); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Akrout, Houcine, Fundamental transformations of trust and its drivers: A multi-stage approach of business-to-business relationships, Industrial Marketing Management, 66, pp. 159-171, (2017); Academy of Management Review, (1977); Aoki, Katsuki, The role of ambidexterity in managing buyer-supplier relationships: The Toyota case, Organization Science, 28, 6, pp. 1080-1097, (2017); Au, Kevin Yuk Fai, Boundary spanning behaviors of expatriates, Journal of World Business, 37, 4, pp. 285-296, (2002); Bals, Lydia, Purchasing and supply management (PSM) competencies: Current and future requirements, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, 5, (2019); Supply Chain Forum an International Journal, (2011); Bhattacharya, Ananya, Antecedents of buyer opportunistic behavior in outsourcing relationships, International Journal of Production Economics, 166, pp. 258-268, (2015); Cai, Shaohan Alan, On boundary spanners and interfirm embeddedness: The role of guanxi institution in China, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 27, 1, (2021)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,,,,16246039; 16258312,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180230509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The study identified 10 RBDBs and employed images in a unique questionnaire survey. Further, permutation tests were employed to compare perceptions of motorcyclists in scenarios involving bus-motorcycle-car flow and bus-motorcycle flow and to compare their perceptions to those of car drivers’. Moreover, heteroskedastic generalized ordered logit regression models were utilized to predict traffic safety perceptions of motorcyclists and car drivers toward RBDBs. Results: High-speed bus driving is perceived as the most dangerous situation, while continuous flashing of lights at vehicles in front is perceived as the least dangerous. The permutation test revealed that motorcyclists tend to perceive RBDBs as less dangerous in bus-motorcycle flow than in mixed flow with cars, while car drivers consider them safer than motorcyclists. The regression model revealed that among the RBDBs, bus moving at high speeds, abruptly overtaking, abruptly changing lanes, and suddenly pulling over at bus stops are perceived as the most dangerous by motorcyclists and car drivers. The study also discusses the relationships between the socio-demographic characteristics of motorcyclists/car drivers and their safety perception toward RBDBs. Conclusions: These findings could inform the development of interventions to reduce RBDBs and improve traffic safety for motorcyclists and car drivers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Car Driver’s Perception; Mixed Traffic Flow; Motorcyclists’ Perception; Risky Bus Driving Behaviors; Traffic Safety; Accident Prevention; Behavioral Research; Bus Drivers; Bus Transportation; Motorcycles; Regression Analysis; Car Driver; Car Driver’s Perception; Driving Behaviour; Mixed Traffic Flow; Motorcyclist’ Perception; Permutation Tests; Questionnaire Surveys; Risky Bus Driving Behavior; Safety Perception; Traffic Safety; Buses; Car; Car Driving; Human; Motor Vehicle; Motorcycle; Prevention And Control; Traffic Accident; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Humans; Motor Vehicles","Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Bus drivers; Bus transportation; Motorcycles; Regression analysis; Car driver; Car driver’s perception; Driving behaviour; Mixed traffic flow; Motorcyclist’ perception; Permutation tests; Questionnaire surveys; Risky bus driving behavior; Safety perception; Traffic safety; Buses; car; car driving; human; motor vehicle; motorcycle; prevention and control; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Humans; Motor Vehicles",,,"This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science and Technology, Japan, under Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho: MEXT) Scholarships.

Here, we examined cross-nationally the structure and correlates of these beliefs with an 8-item scale, using a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. We obtained a two-factor model of unfounded (conspiracy and health) beliefs with good internal structure (average CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04), but a high correlation between the two factors (average latent factor correlation = 0.57). This model was replicable across 50 countries (total N = 13,579), as evidenced by metric invariance between countries (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMS = 0.07) as well as scalar invariance across genders (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03) and educational levels (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03). Also, lower levels of education, more fear of COVID-19, and more cynicism were weakly associated with stronger conspiracy and health beliefs. The study contributes to knowledge about the structure of unfounded beliefs, and reveals the potential relevance of affective (i.e., fear of COVID-19) and cognitive (i.e., cynicism) factors along with demographics, in endorsing such beliefs. In summary, we obtained cross-cultural evidence for the distinctiveness of unfounded conspiracy and health beliefs about COVID-19 in terms of their structure and correlates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Conspiracy Beliefs; Covid-19; Cross-cultural; Health Beliefs; Unfounded Beliefs,,,,"The work of Magdalena \u017Bemojtel-Piotrowska and Jaros\u0142aw Piotrowski was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland under Grant [2017/26/E/HS6/00282].

Our study utilizes the change in educational structure in 1985 as an instrument and finds that women under the new system enhanced their schooling by approximately two years. One year of education prolongs women’s timing of the first birth, decreases female genital mutilation for the first daughter, reduces intimate partner violence, and improves women’s household decision-making. Our findings are robust to several robustness checks. We examined different paths to explain these results, including information exposure, partner matching, and labor market engagement. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dhs; Education; Kenya; Women’s Empowerment; Education; Empowerment; Gender Disparity; Gender Role; Labor Market; Womens Status; Kenya,education; empowerment; gender disparity; gender role; labor market; womens status; Kenya,,,,"undefined, (2009); Acosta, Mariola, What does it Mean to Make a ‘Joint’ Decision?

Moreover, the IC evaluation is, in fact, a multicriteria process with high uncertainty, since the market environments and competitors' performance are both in a dynamic environment. Therefore, the evaluation of IC under uncertainty is vital to organizations. This study proposes a new integrated method for the evaluation of IC in banking organizations by combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the evidential reasoning (ER) approach in terms of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Three Vietnamese banks were used as a case study to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed method. Experts in banking-related fields were invited to determine the relative importance weights of critical innovation management practices (CIMPs) and their sub-CIMPs using the AHP and to score the maturity levels of sub-CIMPs at the evaluated banks. The ER approach was then applied to generate aggregated assessments representing the ICs of banks that were finally used for their ranking in terms of IC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Analytic Hierarchy Process (ahp); Banking; Evaluation; Evidential Reasoning (er); Innovation Capability (ic); Uncertainty; Formal Logic; Hierarchical Systems; Integrated Circuits; Timing Circuits; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Evaluation; Evidential Reasoning; Innovation Capability; Innovation Management; Technological Innovation; Uncertainty,Formal logic; Hierarchical systems; Integrated circuits; Timing circuits; Analytic hierarchy process; Evaluation; Evidential reasoning; Innovation capability; Innovation management; Technological innovation; Uncertainty,,,"This work was supported in part by the Centre of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University, Thailand.","Günday, Gürhan, Effects of innovation types on firm performance, International Journal of Production Economics, 133, 2, pp. 662-676, (2011); Journal of Modern Accounting and Auditing, (2013); Frishammar, Johan, Antecedents and consequences of firms process innovation capability: A literature review and a conceptual framework, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 59, 4, pp. 519-529, (2012); Dozier, Priya D., Banking on Blockchain: An Evaluation of Innovation Decision Making, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 67, 4, pp. 1129-1141, (2020); Wang, Xiaoli, Innovation Efficiency Evaluation Based on a Two-Stage DEA Model With Shared-Input: A Case of Patent-Intensive Industry in China, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 70, 5, pp. 1808-1822, (2023); Koliouska, Christiana H., Multicriteria Evaluation of the Websites of Alternative Tourism Enterprises: Case Study in the Region of Crete, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 70, 6, pp. 2233-2240, (2023); Kong, Yusheng, Service innovation, service delivery and customer satisfaction and loyalty in the banking sector of Ghana, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 37, 5, pp. 1215-1233, (2019); Beccalli, Elena, Does IT investment improve bank performance?

Following an initial single-center survey conducted in 2020, we conducted a second survey of 11 antiretroviral therapy (ART) sites in Northern Vietnam between June 2021 and January 2022. We tested anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) nucleocapsid IgG antibodies and assessed prevention against COVID-19 and impacts of COVID-19 on access to ART, economic security, risky health behaviors, and mental health using self-reported questionnaires. In total, 7808 PLHIV on ART participated in the second survey. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was as low as 1.2%. There was no clear upward trend in COVID-19 infection among PLHIV compared with the rate of infection among the general population. HIV treatment was generally maintained and no increase in risky health behaviors was observed. The economic impacts were significant, with high unemployment rate, poorer economic security, and binge drinking strongly associated with depression. However, the prevalence of depression decreased by 11.2% compared with pre-COVID-19 levels. Social support, including for patients to continue HIV treatment and effective employment/financial assistance, may help to alleviate the negative socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 and improve mental health among PLHIV. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Clinical Trial; Complication; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Multicenter Study; Questionnaire; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Viet Nam; Covid-19; Hiv Infections; Humans; Sars-cov-2; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam,clinical trial; complication; coronavirus disease 2019; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; multicenter study; questionnaire; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Viet Nam; COVID-19; HIV Infections; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam,,,"Funding text 1: This study was financially supported by a JICA/AMED SATREPS project for “Establishment of the ‘Bench-to-Bedside’ Feedback System for Sustainable ART and the Prevention of New HIV Transmission in Vietnam”.

This study describes the types of livelihood adaptations (LAs) that coastal fishers in QN have practiced in response to EWEs and find the varieties in these adaptation strategy choices. In this study, we investigated livelihood adaptation strategies in coastal areas through a household survey and analysis of the collected data using MS Excel. Two sample strategies were used, stratified and random sampling, to select 229 coastal fishers from 11 communes; and data are collected through designed questionnaires. The current study employed statistical disaggregation and comparative methods to analyze coastal fishers’ adaptation strategy choices in QN Province. A range of adaptation strategies were identified consisting of five reactive LAs and eight anticipatory LAs practiced differently by coastal fishers. Among the eight anticipatory LAs, discontinuing production for a certain time is a novel adaptation in QN Province. In addition, a divergence in conducting LAs by production forms was found. On-sand farming and offshore fishers invest in advanced technologies and facilities as adaptive measures. By contrast, fishers who farm in estuaries, lagoons, and nearshore fishing fishers are more likely to change and diversify their jobs. The study’s key findings about livelihood adaptation measures and their differences are significant for improving coastal fisher’s livelihoods in Vietnam. Any efforts at local and national levels in developing mitigation strategies for the impact of EWEs may consider the coastal fisher’s adaptation choices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,"This work was funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through the Project for Human Resources Development Scholarship by the Japanese Grant Aid (JDS).

For most nations, recent estimates and trends of intake are not available; nor variation by education or urbanicity. We investigated SSB intakes among adults between 1990 and 2018 in 185 countries, stratified subnationally by age, sex, education, and rural/urban residence, using data from the Global Dietary Database. In 2018, mean global SSB intake was 2.7 (8 oz = 248 grams) servings/week (95% UI 2.5-2.9) (range: 0.7 (0.5-1.1) in South Asia to 7.8 (7.1-8.6) in Latin America/Caribbean). Intakes were higher in male vs. female, younger vs. older, more vs. less educated, and urban vs. rural adults. Variations by education and urbanicity were largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1990 and 2018, SSB intakes increased by +0.37 (+0.29, +0.47), with the largest increase in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Although considerable variation in item format exists within each modality, previous research has examined this variation almost exclusively among meaning-recognition item types. This article reports on two exploratory studies, each comparing a fully-contextualized and a non-contextualized meaning-recall variant for one specific testing purpose: coverage-comprehension research. The fully-contextualized test utilized the same 622-word passage in each study. In the non-contextualized tests, target words appeared in short, non-defining sentences; in Study A, the elicited response was a translation of only the target item while in Study B, it was the entire prompt sentence. Scores on the compared tests differed significantly only in Study A. In both studies, the consistency with which the compared item formats yielded the same outcome (correct or incorrect) when the same target word was encountered by the same learner was rather low. The provision of relatively authentic context sometimes seemed to aid lexical inferencing, but other times it increased task difficulty relative to the limited-context formats. These findings suggest that different meaning-recall formats could lead to different conclusions regarding knowledge of specific words, and this could impact coverage-comprehension research findings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Contextualized Item Formats; L2 Vocabulary Assessment; L2 Vocabulary Knowledge; Meaning-recall Lexical Knowledge,,,,,"Asquith, Steven, An Investigation into the Roles of Guessing and Partial Knowledge in the Vocabulary Size Test, TESL-EJ, 26, 3, (2022); Vocabulary Education and Research Bulletin, (2012); New General Service List, (2013); undefined; International Journal of Internet Science, (2016); Elgort, Irina, Effects of L1 definitions and cognate status of test items on the Vocabulary Size Test, Language Testing, 30, 2, pp. 253-272, (2013); Validity and Reliability, (2013); Reading in A Second Language Moving from Theory to Practice, (2009); Gyllstad, Henrik, Using confidence intervals to determine adequate item sample sizes for vocabulary tests: An essential but overlooked practice, Language Testing, 38, 4, pp. 558-579, (2021); Gyllstad, Henrik, Assessing vocabulary size through multiple-choice formats: Issues with guessing and sampling rates, ITL - International Journal of Applied Linguistics (Belgium), 166, 2, pp. 278-306, (2015)",,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,27727661,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172387135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike many smart technologies, emotion-recognition systems sense, monitor, harvest and analyze data extracted from a person’s non-conscious or psycho-physical state, often without their knowledge or consent. As a far more invasive manner of surveillance capitalism, the technological adoption of emotional AI is problematized by a myriad of legal, ethical, cultural, and scientific issues. To better understand the behavioral factors determining an individual’s attitude towards this emerging technology, we first identify five major tensions that may impinge on adoption. Second, we extend the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) model with insights from the mindsponge model of information filtering (Vuong and Napier, 2015) along with quantitative affordances offered by the Bayesian computational approach. Our analysis was conducted based on a multi-national dataset surveying perceptions of 1015 young adults (age 18–27) regarding emotional AI applications and their socio-cultural characteristics such as income, region, religiosity, and home country politics. These characteristics are fed into our Bayesian multi-level models as varying intercepts so that we can systematically measure and compare the effects of various behavioral determinants on the attitudes of respondents towards non-conscious data harvesting by government and private sector actors. Critically, this study finds respondents who feel more familiar with, and perceive more utilities in AI technologies, as well as rate themselves as more restrained from heated arguments on social media, feel less threatened by the practice of non-conscious data harvesting by both government and private sector actors. Our findings offer a fertile platform for further exploration of the intersection between psychology, culture, and emotion-recognition technologies as well as important insights for policymakers wishing to ensure design and regulation of the technology serve the best interests of society. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,"This study is part of the project \u201CEmotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life \u201D funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019) (https://www.jst.go.jp/ristex/hite/en/topics/409.html), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6.

The research addresses key questions regarding the speed of Asian states’ involvement in multilateral treaties and their adaptation to these treaties within the United Nations system over time. The approach combines empirical data and conceptualization to ensure a robust evidentiary basis. A dataset comprising 600 major multilateral treaties deposited in the United Nations system, covering diverse global issues, was collected. Additionally, ratification actions from twenty-eight Asian countries were categorized into four sub-regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia. To quantitatively measure states’ engagement with multilateral treaties, the study developed and calculated the Treaty Participation Index for each Asian country and sub-group. In an area predominantly characterized by qualitative research, this paper contributes to the existing literature by providing quantitative and metric findings for comparative analyses of multilateral treaty participation among the four Asian sub-regions, as well as comparisons between Asia and the rest of the world. By analyzing the results, the paper offers an evidence-based assessment of the feasibility of these four regionalisms in Asia, particularly in the context of the transition from international politics to the paradigm of global politics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 506.01-2019.301.,"Conventions Treaties and Other Responses to Global Issues in Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems Eolss Developed Under the Auspices of the Unesco, (2004); Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira, Minority game with local interactions due to the presence of herding behavior, Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics, 355, 4-5, pp. 280-284, (2006); Denemark, Robert A., Just scraps of paper?: The dynamics of multilateral treaty-making, Cooperation and Conflict, 43, 2, pp. 185-219, (2008); Frederick, Shane W., Time discounting and time preference: A critical review, Journal of Economic Literature, 40, 2, pp. 351-401, (2002); Glas, Aarie, Understanding Multilateral Treaty-Making as Constitutive Practice, Journal of Global Security Studies, 3, 3, pp. 339-357, (2018); Opendemocracy, (2017); Jia Sipa, (2020); Foreign Affairs, (2002); Development of Global Legislative Politics Rousseau and Locke Writ Global, (2019); undefined, (2023)",,Springer Nature,,,,,,26629992,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164140668,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parenting is embedded in cultural values, and previous research has shown the role of individualism in PB. In this paper, we reanalyze previously collected data to identify profiles based on the four dimensions of PB, and explore whether these profiles vary across countries’ levels of collectivistic-individualistic (COL-IND) values. Our sample comprised 16,885 individuals from 36 countries (73% women; 27% men), and we used a latent profile approach to uncover PB profiles. The findings showed five profiles: Fulfilled, Not in PB, Low risk of PB, High risk of PB and Burned out. The profiles pointed to climbing levels of PB in the total sample and in each of the three country groups (High COL/Low IND, Medium COL-IND, Low COL/High IND). Exploratory analyses revealed that distinct dimensions of PB had the most prominent roles in the climbing pattern, depending on the countries’ levels of COL/IND. In particular, we found contrast to be a hallmark dimension and an indicator of severe burnout for individualistic countries. Contrary to our predictions, emotional distance and saturation did not allow a clear differentiation across collectivistic countries. Our findings support several research avenues regarding PB measurement and intervention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Collectivism; Cultural Values; Individualism; Latent Profile Analyses; Parental Burnout; Adult; Article; Burnout; Climbing; Controlled Study; Cultural Value; Exploratory Research; Female; Human; Human Tissue; Individuality; Major Clinical Study; Male; Prediction,adult; article; burnout; climbing; controlled study; cultural value; exploratory research; female; human; human tissue; individuality; major clinical study; male; prediction,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under grant FCTUIDB/00050/2020.","Aguiar, Joyce Cristina Dos Santos, Parental Burnout and the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Portuguese Parents Experienced Lockdown Measures, Family Relations, 70, 4, pp. 927-938, (2021); Eryılmaz, Günce Sabah, Validation of the Turkish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 15-32, (2020); Aunola, Kaisa, Validity of the Finnish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 61, 5, pp. 714-722, (2020); Bornstein, Marc H., Cultural Approaches to Parenting, Parenting, 12, 2-3, pp. 212-221, (2012); Celeux, Gilles, An entropy criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model, Journal of Classification, 13, 2, pp. 195-212, (1996); Cheng, Huabin, Validation of a Chinese Version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, Frontiers in Psychology, 11, (2020); Furutani, Kaichiro, Exhausted parents in Japan: Preliminary validation of the Japanese version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 33-49, (2020); Gannagé, Myrna, Parental burnout in Lebanon: Validation psychometric properties of the Lebanese Arabic version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 51-65, (2020); Hamvai, Csaba, Parental Burnout in Hungary: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Hungarian Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA-HUN), European Journal of Mental Health, 17, 1, pp. 47-61, (2022); Hansotte, Logan, Are all Burned Out Parents Neglectful and Violent?

We construct a financial literacy index using a representative sample of 25,000 individuals from the Bank of Japan’s 2019 Financial Literacy Survey. We then analyze the relationship between this index and the extensive and intensive usage of two types of payment services: electronic money (e-money) and mobile payment apps. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that higher financial literacy is positively associated with a higher likelihood of adopting ePayment services. The empirical results suggest that individuals with higher financial literacy use payment services more frequently.

Early identification and prevention rely on detailed epidemiological studies, which are limited in Asia. This retrospective study used the registry data of Pan-Asian Trauma Outcome Study (PATOS) from October 1, 2015 to December, 31, 2020. Pediatric patients (aged < 20 years) with non-accidental injuries were enrolled, which were divided by age into preschool (0–6 years), child (7–12 years), and adolescent (13–19 years) groups. Baseline characteristics, injury epidemiology, and excess mortality ratio-adjusted injury severity score (EMR-ISS) were collected. Major trauma was defined as an EMR-ISS score > 24. The study enrolled 451 patients with non-accidental injuries, accounting for 2.81% of pediatric trauma events presented to an emergency department in the PATOS registry. The overall mortality rate was 0.9%, similar to those in Western countries. Mortality rate was high in preschool children (8.7%, p = 0.017) than in other age groups. The sex-specific incidence was higher in boys (3.10% vs. 2.13%, p = 0.001). In adolescents, more events occurred on the street (25.9%), whereas home remained the most common locale in girls of all ages. In the multivariable regression analysis, abdominal and multiple injuries were risk factors for major trauma. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Asia; Child; Clinical Trial; Female; Hospital Emergency Service; Human; Infant; Injury; Injury Scale; Male; Multicenter Study; Multiple Trauma; Preschool Child; Retrospective Study; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Infant; Injury Severity Score; Male; Multiple Trauma; Retrospective Studies; Wounds And Injuries","adolescent; Asia; child; clinical trial; female; hospital emergency service; human; infant; injury; injury scale; male; multicenter study; multiple trauma; preschool child; retrospective study; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Infant; Injury Severity Score; Male; Multiple Trauma; Retrospective Studies; Wounds and Injuries",,,"The funding was provided by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST 107-2314-B-002-007, MOST 108-2314-B-002-130-MY3, National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch, NTUHYL.111.S017.","Monuteaux, Michael Carl, A cross-sectional study of emergency care utilization and associated costs of violent-related (assault) injuries in the United States, Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, 83, 2, pp. 310-315, (2017); Roberts, Zoë E.S., Epidemiology of adolescent trauma in England: A review of TARN data 2008-2017, Emergency Medicine Journal, 37, 1, pp. 25-30, (2020); Seah, Rebecca, Hospitalization Due to Assault Injury Across Different Age Groups, 2010 to 2014: A Population-Based Study in New South Wales, Australia, Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health, 31, 1, pp. 39-50, (2019); Litz, Cristen N., A closer look at non-accidental trauma: Caregiver assault compared to non-caregiver assault, Journal of Pediatric Surgery, 52, 4, pp. 625-627, (2017); Barmparas, Galinos, Assault in children admitted to trauma centers: Injury patterns and outcomes from a 5-year review of the national trauma data bank, International Journal of Surgery, 43, pp. 137-144, (2017); Roaten, J.

As a result, traffic congestion, emissions, and traffic safety have been on the rise. Of particular concern is the significant increase in the number of traffic accidents due to higher traffic volume that is stimulated by economic development and improved households’ economic mobility. During this time frame, many programs, such as traffic safety awareness campaign, have been developed and implemented by transportation agencies to reduce traffic fatalities. This study seeks to understand the long-term effect of policy intervention on traffic fatalities. This is accomplished by developing a log-linear regression model which the response variable is the number of traffic fatalities between 1990 and 2019 and the independent variables include Human Development Index (HDI), motorcycle ownership, and policy interventions. The model estimation results indicate that: (1) a higher degree of economic development (HDI) corresponds to lower traffic fatalities, (2) the motorcycle helmet law has lowered the number of annual traffic fatalities since its enactment, and (3) a higher number of motorcycle trips corresponds to a higher number of traffic fatalities. Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that transportation agencies in Vietnam develop and promote an alternative transportation mode. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Human Development Index; Motorcycle Ownership; Traffic Fatality; Transporation Policy Intervention; Accident Prevention; Economic And Social Effects; Motor Transportation; Regression Analysis; Traffic Congestion; Economic Development; Human Development Index; Motorcycle Ownerships; Policy Intervention; Road Traffic Fatalities; Traffic Fatalities; Traffic Safety; Transporation Policy Intervention; Transportation Agencies; Viet Nam; Motorcycles,Accident prevention; Economic and social effects; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Traffic congestion; Economic development; Human development index; Motorcycle ownerships; Policy intervention; Road traffic fatalities; Traffic fatalities; Traffic safety; Transporation policy intervention; Transportation agencies; Viet Nam; Motorcycles,,,,"Abbas, Alaa K., Does wearing helmets reduce motorcycle-related death?

Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that regular paper-based records are vulnerable to both physical destruction and the act of fabrication, while standard databases can have security holes. Moreover, the process of manually gathering physical papers from centralized organizations is both laborious and complicated. To address the concerns above and foster sustainability in the field of education, this study first suggests using Scorechain. This innovative solution integrates blockchain technology into a comprehensive data-management system for managing all student-related data. Secondly, by utilizing the inherent security features of blockchain technology, Scorechain develops a stable multi-role hierarchy, increasing the integrity and reliability of data. This also facilitates the efficient transfer of information among various stakeholders, including parents, recruiters, and educational institutions, thus fostering transparency and accountability. Lastly, the Scorechain system facilitates collaboration and data exchange among universities inside a shared network. Scorechain was constructed using the Rust programming language and is based on the Substrate blockchain architecture. It underwent careful development, testing, and analysis to ensure operational efficiency. The feasibility and long-term viability of Scorechain in genuine educational contexts are highlighted as blockchain technology facilitates seamless integration into the education sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; Education 4.0; Smart Campus; Sustainable Education; Connectivity; Education; Institutional Framework; Stakeholder; Sustainability; University Sector,connectivity; education; institutional framework; stakeholder; sustainability; university sector,,,,"Well Being of Nations the Role of Human and Social Capital, (2001); Putro, Prasetyo Adi Wibowo, An Authentic and Secure Printed Document from Forgery Attack by Combining Perceptual Hash and Optical Character Recognition, pp. 157-162, (2019); Grolleau, Gilles, An introduction to the economics of fake degrees, Journal of Economic Issues, 42, 3, pp. 673-694, (2008); Diploma and Accreditation Mills New Trends in Credential Abuse, (2011); Proceedings of 1st Ercim Blockchain Workshop 2018, (2018); Malsa, Nitima, Framework and smart contract for blockchain enabled certificate verification system using robotics, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 960, pp. 125-138, (2021); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Von-Eitzen-Delgado, Christian, Blockchain applications in education: A systematic literature review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 24, (2021); Zhao, Mao, Blockchain in Online Learning: A Systematic Review and Bibliographic Visualization, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 2, (2023); Arndt, Timothy, Blockchain-based transcripts for mobile higher-education, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10, 2, pp. 84-89, (2020)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,,,20711050,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185924009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to tests employing single-word or limited-context prompts, research suggests that contextualized assessment is more reliable and demonstrates better concurrent validity. In meaning-recall vocabulary assessment, examinees retrieve target-word meaning from memory and typically demonstrate knowledge via a written L2-to-L1 translation. Compared to multiple-choice formats, meaning-recall yields more reliable data, correlates more strongly with reading comprehension, and is less influenced by guessing and test strategies. To facilitate these approaches to vocabulary assessment, this article introduces a resource for teachers and researchers to create, administer, and mark contextualized meaning-recall tests. Users input a passage, select target items, and share the test URL with examinees.

Utilising firm-level data from the Vietnam Technology and Competitiveness Survey and Vietnam Enterprise Survey from 2009 to 2018, we employ panel fixed-effect regression to analyse the dynamics. The findings show that Vietnam’s GVC participation has been driven mainly by backward rather than forward linkages, signifying a reliance on foreign inputs for exports. The study found a positive impact of backward and forward GVC participation on labour productivity. However, the results show a stark contrast when considering the degree of GVC participation (i.e. GVC participation index). While forward GVC participation positively impacts labour productivity, backward GVC participation demonstrates a negative effect. The results partly reject the learning-to-learn hypothesis while supporting the notion that productivity improvements in Vietnam are associated with learning-by-exporting and learning-by-supplying. We suggest that the prioritisation of forward GVC participation should be accompanied by well-designed backward participation strategies to promote labour productivity.

This paper aims to elucidate the PFES implementation in Thua Thien Hue Province, and to assess the influence of the PFES on the livelihood of forest protectors, especially ethnic minorities. We interviewed 133 out of 397 households in two villages in Hong Kim commune, divided into two different groups: Forest protection groups (FPG) and Non-forest protection groups (NFPG). Our study indicated that the success in negotiating and expanding the number of service users has increased the forest area covered by the PFES for seven years. Nonetheless, revenue from PFES still fluctuates from year to year due to their great dependence on a limited number of service users. PFES payment (only 2%) did not contribute significantly to the total income of forest protector households. Interestingly, both monetary and non-monetary values seem to encourage local people to join the forest protection group. To better implement PFES, it is necessary to identify and expand service beneficiaries. Remote sensing technology improved PFES in TTH by aiding forest patrols, but there is a lack of maintaining forest quality during degradation, needing commitments to restore degraded forests and raise patrol accountability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ethnic Minorities; Mountainous Livelihood; Pfes; Thua Thien Hue; Vietnam; Ecosystem Service; Ethnic Minority; Forest Resource; Livelihood; Remote Sensing; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam,ecosystem service; ethnic minority; forest resource; livelihood; remote sensing; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam,,,"This research was funded by the Special Program of Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) , Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) .","undefined, (2019); Forests and Gender Iucn Wedo, (2011); Payment for Environmental Services in Agricultural Landscapes, (2009); undefined, (2021); Clements, Tom J., Impact of payments for environmental services and protected areas on local livelihoods and forest conservation in northern Cambodia, Conservation Biology, 29, 1, pp. 78-87, (2015); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2015); undefined, (2019); undefined, (2010); undefined, (2016)",,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,26667193,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164206595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research examines the factors affecting the internet use of agricultural cooperatives with a focus on female leadership, its effects on cooperatives’ economic, social, and innovative performance, and the distributional effects of internet use on economic performance. Our analysis relied on the data of 3,512 agricultural cooperatives collected in 2021 from Vietnam. We addressed the endogeneity issue of internet use in impact assessment by employing an instrumental variable approach. Our results show that female leadership was positively and significantly associated with internet use and that internet use had a positive and significant effect on returns on assets, returns on equity, labor productivity, payment per laborer, contribution to labor union and insurance per laborer, and innovation in products of agricultural cooperatives. In addition, unconditional quantile regressions show that internet use in agricultural cooperatives exacerbated income inequality.

To achieve the goal of popularizing OF, besides encouraging the participation of newcomers, the government should also focus on farmers already involved because their production decisions are the most effective means for communication. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated smallholder farmer intentions to scale up organic rice farming (ORF). Data were obtained through direct interviews with 325 farmers in the Phu Vang, Phong Dien and Huong Thuy Districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The results revealed the ineffectiveness in demographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, number of laborers, OF experience, percentage of organic rice area, non-farm jobs and involvement in community-based organizations to predict farmer intentions to expand ORF. The findings highlighted the more significant influence of factors related to economic outcomes, farmer awareness of OF, and their confidence in the market outlook. We recommend policies and interventions associated with promoting the advantages of organic agriculture, intensifying technical training, linking production with the market following the value chain model, equipping the market with information, diversifying support and timely undertaking of issued policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Central Vietnam; Farmers’ Intention; Organic Farming; Organic Rice Farming,,,,"The authors would like to thank the authorities and farmers in Phu Vang, Phong Dien, and Huong Thuy districts for their support during the survey.

Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model on multiple cross-sectional data sets derived from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) of 2004–2016 and follows a consistent two-step procedure to deal with the zero consumption issue. The estimated demand elasticities are then compared and analyzed over time. Findings: The empirical results show that in the last decade, meat consumption patterns in Vietnam have undergone a remarkable structural change, with poultry and beef increasingly taking important roles in the meat consumption structure of households. In addition, demographic characteristics, including settlement type, household size and the age of the household head, have significantly influenced meat expenditure patterns in Vietnam. Research limitations/implications: The paper considers the demand for meat consumed at home but not meat consumed away from home. Originality/value: In many developing countries, increased disposable income, together with rapid urbanization and international integration, has significantly changed consumers' food consumption behaviors. This is one of the first studies using household survey data, which permits the exploration of heterogeneous preferences between consumers, to explore structural changes in food consumption patterns in Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bootstrap; Censoring; Livestock Sector; Meat Consumption; Restructuring; Structural Changes; Sustainable Development; Vietnam,,,,,"Jabarin, Amer S., Estimation of meat demand system in Jordan: An almost ideal demand system, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 29, 3, pp. 232-238, (2005); Banks, James, Quadratic engel curves and consumer demand, Review of Economics and Statistics, 79, 4, pp. 527-538, (1997); Bi̇lgi̇ç, Abdulbaki, Household food demand in Turkey: A two-step demand system approach, Food Policy, 43, pp. 267-277, (2013); Bronnmann, Julia, Efficiency of correction for sample selection in QUAIDS models: an example for the fish demand in Germany, Empirical Economics, 57, 4, pp. 1469-1493, (2019); Cashin, Paul A., A MODEL OF THE DISAGGREGATED DEMAND FOR MEAT IN AUSTRALIA, Australian Journal of Agricultural Economics, 35, 3, pp. 263-283, (1991); American Economic Review, (1980); Food Agriculture and the Environment Discussion Paper 28, (1999); Delport, Marion, Evaluating the demand for meat in South Africa: an econometric estimation of short term demand elasticities, Agrekon, 56, 1, pp. 13-27, (2017); Eales, James S., Simultaneity and structural change in u.S. meat demand, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 75, 2, pp. 259-268, (1993); Faharuddin, Faharuddin, Nutrient elasticities of food consumption: the case of Indonesia, Journal of Agribusiness in Developing and Emerging Economies, 7, 3, pp. 198-217, (2017)",,Emerald Publishing,,,,,,20440839; 20440847,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126763586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the association between mental health conditions and FGIDs among Vietnamese new-entry medical students. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in February 2022 among new-entry medical students in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. A printed questionnaire was distributed to all students on the day of freshmen health screening. Their urine samples were collected to screen for Helicobacter pylori infection using rapid urinary test. FGIDs were diagnosed using ROME IV criteria. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was defined as the presence of typical reflux symptoms at least twice a week. Mental health conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), were identified using Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scales, respectively. Results Among 400 new-entry medical students who participated in the study, the overall prevalence of FGIDs was 10.3% (functional dyspepsia 6.5%, irritable bowel disease 5.5%). The overlap syndrome (OS) of GERD-FGIDs or different FGIDs was present in 3.0% of participants. The prevalences of GAD and MDD were 6.8% and 10.2%, respectively. The urinary test was positive in 180 (45.0%) participants. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, MDD was significantly associated with not only the risk of FGIDs (OR = 5.599, 95%CI: 2.173–14.430, p<0.001) but also the risk of OS (OR = 10.076, 95CI%: 2.243–45.266, p = 0.003). Conclusions MDD is associated with FGIDs and OS among new-entry medical students. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Rapirun H.

This knowledge gap presents challenges for identifying at-risk individuals and communities and could impede effective public policy and resource allocation for adaptation efforts. To address this issue, this study employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index referencing IPCC definitions (LVI-IPCC) framework to examine livelihood vulnerability and its determinants among 455 small-scale households in the coastal areas of Phu Vang district, Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. The LVI-IPCC calculation utilized a database of 11 major and 33 sub-indicators collected through a household survey conducted in 2021. The findings revealed that these households exhibit moderate vulnerability to natural disasters and climate shocks, as reflected by their high sensitivity index scores. Additionally, the study identified a persistent cycle of poverty and livelihood vulnerability among coastal communities, wherein poverty and reliance on nature-based income serve as the root cause of the exposure and a gateway to this loop. This study strongly advocates for a pro-poor approach that places poverty alleviation at the forefront of community development planning and climate change agendas. Under this approach, developing value chain models in agriculture and aquaculture and diversifying livelihoods through activities such as community-based tourism is highly recommended. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Coastal Areas; Livelihood Vulnerability; Poverty; Vietnam,,,,"The authors would like to express their gratitude for the support received from Project VIE/433 - Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience in Thua Thien Hue Province, Vietnam.

It also examined the factors associated with students’ speaking skills, their motives for studying Japanese, and their needs for communication with native Japanese speakers while proposing a hypothetical model linking these constructs. A total of 108 students participated in the cross-sectional online survey questionnaire, which included questions on personal information, perceived Japanese language skills, motives for studying Japanese, needs for communication with native Japanese speakers, and self-esteem. The data were analyzed using SPSS. The results showed that the respondents perceived their Japanese speaking skills level as lower than the other three skills. Factors such as age, year of enrollment, years studying Japanese, English level, co-living status, study abroad experience, and self-esteem were found to be associated with the perceived speaking skills of the respondents. Family-related factors, such as parents’ education and the family’s study abroad experience, were also found to be associated with perceived speaking skills. The study also validated three constructs of motives for studying Japanese, including being interested in Japan, being interested in communication, and being interested in going to Japan and highlighting the respondents’ needs for communication with native speakers. The proposed model suggests that motives for studying Japanese influence perceived speaking skills and the need for communication with native Japanese speakers. The findings of this study have implications for Japanese language education, particularly in the development of teaching strategies that enhance students’ speaking skills and provide opportunities for communication with native speakers. It also underscores the importance of understanding students’ motives for studying Japanese, as these motivations can influence their language proficiency and the effectiveness of language education programs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Communication; Japanese Language; Native Japanese Speaker; Speaking Skills,,,,This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP20K02610.,"Overseas Japanese Language Education Institution Survey 2021 Results, (2021); de Burgh-Hirabe, Ryoko, Motivation to learn Japanese as a foreign language in an English speaking country: An exploratory case study in New Zealand, System, 80, pp. 95-106, (2019); Huang, Wenhong, Exploring the dynamics of motivation for learning Japanese among Chinese learners: an elicited metaphor analysis, Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 40, 7, pp. 605-617, (2019); Izumi, (2020); Japanese Language Education Around the Global, (1998); Integr Sci Glob Soc Stud, (2020); Journal of Japanese Language Teaching, (2010); Bull Cent Int Educ Hitotsubashi Univ, (2011); Japanese Language Education; Icu Jpn Lang Educ Res, (2014)",,MDPI,,,,,,22277102,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163737455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework of research hypotheses between transformational leadership, green learning and green innovation is developed. Using a survey questionnaire, data are collected from construction firms in Vietnam. Structural equation modeling is used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that transformational leadership promotes both green learning and green innovation (i.e. green product innovation and green process innovation) while green learning positively affects green process innovation. Furthermore, it is found that green learning mediates the linkage between transformational leadership and green process innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the development of leadership research in construction by showing the significance of leadership at the supply chain level. Originality/value: Leadership is regarded as a key factor for most organizations' success and competitive advantages. In construction, leadership has been widely studied at the project and organizational levels while its important role is also explored at the supply chain level. Nevertheless, in terms of construction supply chains, there has been still very limited evidence about the effects of transformational leadership. Thus, this study fills the gap in knowledge by empirically examining the relationships between transformational leadership, green learning and green innovation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Construction; Green Innovation; Green Learning; Supply Chains; Transformational Leadership; Competition; Construction Industry; Surveys; Construction Supply Chain; Design/methodology/approach; Green Innovations; Green Learning; Green Process; Innovation In Construction; Process Innovation; Questionnaire Data; Theoretical Framework; Transformational Leadership; Supply Chains,Competition; Construction industry; Surveys; Construction supply chain; Design/methodology/approach; Green innovations; Green learning; Green process; Innovation in construction; Process Innovation; Questionnaire data; Theoretical framework; Transformational leadership; Supply chains,,,,"Albort-Morant, Gema, The antecedents of green innovation performance: A model of learning and capabilities, Journal of Business Research, 69, 11, pp. 4912-4917, (2016); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Argote, Linda M., Organizational Learning and Management of Technology, Production and Operations Management, 26, 4, pp. 579-590, (2017); Barrick, Murray R., Collective organizational engagement: Linking motivational antecedents, strategic implementation, and firm performance, Academy of Management Journal, 58, 1, pp. 111-135, (2015); Bass, Bernard M., From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision, Organizational Dynamics, 18, 3, pp. 19-31, (1990); Transformational Leadership, (2006); Becker, Jan Michael, Accounting for sampling weights in PLS path modeling: Simulations and empirical examples, European Management Journal, 34, 6, pp. 606-617, (2016); Bessant, John R., Developing learning networks, AI and Society, 15, 1-2, pp. 82-98, (2001); Bessant, John R., Putting supply chain learning into practice, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 23, 2, pp. 167-184, (2003); Boehm, Stephan Alexander, The missing link?

To assess DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) graduation exams, this study analyzed their 2021 implementation in comparison to onsite exams conducted in 2020 and 2022 at the Faculty of Odonto-Stomatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam (FOS-UMPH). The final online examination comprises two main sessions: a synchronous online examination using FOS-UMPH e-Learning for theories (consisting of 200 MCQs and 3 written tests with 3 clinical situations needed be solved) and a synchronous online examination using Microsoft Teams for practicum (comprising of 12 online OSCE stations). The final grades were evaluated using the same metrics in face-toface final examinations in 2022 and 2020. A total of 114, 112 and 95 students were recruited for the first-time exams in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In order to analyze the reliability, histogram and k-mean clustering were employed. The histograms from 2020, 2021 and 2022 showed a striking similarity. However, fewer students failed in 2021 and 2022 (13% and 12.6%, respectively) compared to 2020 (28%), with clinical problem-solving part grades (belonging to theory session) being notably higher in 2021 and 2022. Intriguingly, the MCQ Score results showed the identical patterns. The courses of orthodontics, dental public health, and pediatrics subjects (in the group of prevention and development dentistry) stood out for their exceptional accuracy across both sessions. After examining data gathered over three years, we identified three distinct clusters: the first comprised of scattered average and low scores, the second characterized by high scores but unstable and scattered and the third cluster boasting consistently high and centered scores. According to our study, online and onsite traditional graduation exam results are relatively equivalent, but additional measures are necessary to standardize the final examination and adapt to the new normal trend in dental education. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Dental Examination; Dental Health; Dental Student; E-learning; Human; Medical Examination; National Lockdown; Preventive Dentistry; Problem Solving; Reliability; School Closure; Student Attitude; Viet Nam; Benchmarking; Child; Cluster Analysis; Communicable Disease Control; Reproducibility; Benchmarking; Child; Cluster Analysis; Communicable Disease Control; Covid-19; Humans; Reproducibility Of Results,Article; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dental examination; dental health; dental student; e-learning; human; medical examination; national lockdown; preventive dentistry; problem solving; reliability; school closure; student attitude; Viet Nam; benchmarking; child; cluster analysis; communicable disease control; reproducibility; Benchmarking; Child; Cluster Analysis; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Reproducibility of Results,,,,"O'Doherty, Diane, Barriers and solutions to online learning in medical education - An integrative review, BMC Medical Education, 18, 1, (2018); Nijakowski, Kacper, The effectiveness of the blended learning in conservative dentistry with endodontics on the basis of the survey among 4th-year students during the covid-19 pandemic, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 9, (2021); Barabari, Poyan, Novel coronavirus (covid-19) and dentistry–a comprehensive review of literature, Dentistry Journal, 8, 2, (2020); International Journal of Business Management Economic Research, (2018); Timmis, Sue, Rethinking assessment in a digital age: opportunities, challenges and risks, British Educational Research Journal, 42, 3, pp. 454-476, (2016); Durning, Steven J., Comparing open-book and closed-book examinations: A systematic review, Academic Medicine, 91, 4, pp. 583-599, (2016); BMJ, (2012); Applied Statistics, (1979); Doan, Linhphuong, The COVID-19 endemic in Vietnam: Contextual considerations and implications, Frontiers in Public Health, 11, (2023); Hong, Sumin, Effects of a blended design of closed-book and open-book examinations on dental students’ anxiety and performance, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023)",,Public Library of Science,,,,,,19326203,,POLNC,37224149,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160122811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large-scale quantitative approach was applied with a national survey in the midst of the fourth wave of Covid-19 outbreak in Vietnam. The research obtained data from 2252 students from various universities in Vietnam. Results showed that experienced positive affect and negative affect fully mediated the relationships between students’ self-emotion appraisal and their resilience during the pandemic. Surprisingly, other-emotion appraisal decreased positive affect while increased negative affect, though both affect types mediated the other-emotion appraisal-resilience relationship. The two types of affects also played mediating roles in the relationship between the ability of using emotion and resilience among students during the crisis, and the moderation was partial. Finally, while students’ regulation of emotion was not related to either their experienced negative affect or resilience, it was indirectly associated with students’ resilience during the pandemic via the mediating role of positive affect.

To this end, ICN (Information-Centric Networking), which implements the innovative ideas of in-network caching and named content as the communication identifier instead of IP address as in TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, the standard Internet protocol suite), has been among the most promising future Internet (FI) designs to solve most of the conventional IP-based network architecture. However, ICN also consumes higher energy than TCP/IP design as extra power is required for enabling in-network caching capability. Hence, this energy efficiency (EE) issue needs to be addressed so that ICN can be a feasible and practical FI architecture for highly efficient yet sustainable network infrastructure deployment. This chapter then presents and investigates the performance of a novel ""green"" FI prototype, termed as Green ICN, for the realization of a scalable and sustainable real-world network infrastructure toward future networks.

In Vietnam, around 70,000 households were displaced in 2020, causing uncertainty and social disruption. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of resettlement on the livelihood and food security of displaced households, explore the underlying challenges and causes of these effects, and recommend policy implications for sustainable livelihood development and poverty alleviation. This study conducted a decade-long sociological examination of three displaced communities in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. Our research reveals that resettled households are unable to regain their former standard of living due to the loss of cultivated land and restricted access to public property, which exacerbates food insecurity. Unemployment, illiteracy, and low income further perpetuate poverty. These findings highlight the deficiencies in current policies and planning approaches and call for implementing socially responsible resettlement processes guided by principles of equity. Addressing the inequalities arising from displacement and enabling affected communities to participate in growth is economically justified and morally imperative. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Food Insecurity; Hydropower Dams; Impoverishment; Livelihoods; Poverty,,,,,"Special Evaluation Study on the Social and Environmental Impacts of Selected Hydropower Projects, (1999); Research Methods in Anthropology Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches, (2006); Bisht, Tulsi Charan, Development-Induced displacement and women: The case of the Tehri Dam, India, Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology, 10, 4, pp. 301-317, (2009); Bui, Hang Thi Minh, Resettling Farm Households in Northwestern Vietnam: Livelihood Change and Adaptation, International Journal of Water Resources Development, 27, 4, pp. 769-785, (2011); Bui, Hang Thi Minh, Hydropower development in Vietnam: Involuntary resettlement and factors enabling rehabilitation, Land Use Policy, 31, pp. 536-544, (2013); Cernea, Michael M., The risks and reconstruction model for resettling displaced populations, World Development, 25, 10, pp. 1569-1587, (1997); Un Symposium on Hydropower and Sustainable Development, (2004); Paper Presented at the Un Symposium on Hydropower and Sustainable Development in Support of and as Background to the Keynote Paper Presented by the Same Author in the Set of Sessions of the Symposium Devoted to the Social Aspects of Hydropower Development, (2002); Cernea, Michael M., For a new economics of resettlement: A sociological critique of the compensation principle, International Social Science Journal, 55, 175, pp. 37-45, (2003); Water Science and Engineering, (2008)",,MDPI,,,,,,20760760,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153773882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thus urgent to examine their perceptions of the potential risks, their coping strategies, and the factors influencing their adaptation decisions in agriculture production. By exploring adaptation measures of the Xo Dang and Co Tu EMFs in Quang Nam province, Central Vietnam, the study results reveal that the EMFs are increasingly conscious of local climate shocks in the recent decade; as a result, they have applied multiple specific strategies in agriculture production to mitigate risks. The findings indicate that the key variables of the age of the household head, income, household size, residence period at the locality, and farmers' perception of climate change significantly influenced the households’ adaptation decisions. Recognizing this, the study proposed specific recommendations and policy implications to minimize risks while maximizing benefits for the EMFs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation Decisions; Agriculture Production; Central Vietnam; Climate Change; Ethnic Minority Farmers (emfs),,,,"Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by Hue University under the Core Research Program, Grant No. NCM.

The authors consider the impacts that this may have on the livelihoods of rural Vietnamese small farmers. Rice is an “impure public good” that includes both “private” and “public” attributes that consumers consider in their purchase decisions. Consumers make tradeoffs between environmentally and socially beneficial practices (public goods) and perceptions of product quality (private goods). The authors used latent class modeling to investigate the values associated with attributes of rice that is produced using sustainable farming practices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a discrete choice experimental design in which consumers stated their choices among combinations of rice attributes. The survey provided responses from 360 urban Vietnamese consumers and allowed to estimate the preferences and nonpecuniary values for rice grown using different levels of environmentally beneficial production methods. Findings: The results identify two segments of rice consumers: one group of consumers who are sensitive to price and the other group who are sensitive to environmental issues. The individual characteristics are reflected in the choices of production methods and in the willingness to pay for environmentally beneficial outcomes of those methods. Research limitations/implications: Given the number of independent variables measured, the sample was relatively small, such that confirmatory statistical methods were inconclusive. However, the authors used multiple analytical tools that provide corroboration of the significant determinants of the utility functions for the two segments. Practical implications: The results provide directions for production of rice at a national level, as well as practical implications for consumer-oriented communications. Social implications: Results suggest that the emerging middle class of Vietnamese consumers are willing to pay more for rice that is produced using methods that are beneficial to the environment. Results also indicate challenges to provide sustainably-produced rice to poorer groups of consumers. Originality/value: The study provides important context for consumer preferences within emerging economies. This also adds to a growing literature that uses the choice experiment method to estimate consumer valuation of the outcomes of various agricultural practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Choice Modeling; Emerging Economies; Impure Public Good; Rice; Sustainable Food Production; Willingness To Pay,,,,The corresponding author received financial support from the Global Engagement Office of the Sam M.

The primary objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting Vietnamese consumer intention to purchase safely certified vegetables (safe vegetables) based on an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 361 urban consumers in Hanoi city based on a stratified sampling technique, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the model. Findings: The results revealed that the extended TPB succeeded to predict 62% of the variance of intention to purchase safe vegetables. Attitude played the most important role in consumer intention. Notably, the attitude of consumers was the most largely influenced by subjective norms (social effects). Also, subjective norms had a direct effect on intention. Furthermore, consumer trust motivated a favorable attitude to increase purchase intention. The effects of past behavior on intention were verified as direct and indirect through subjective norm and trust combined with attitude. Few socio-demographic variables (e.g. age and education) were found to affect intention indirectly through attitude and subjective norm. Research limitations/implications: Further research on the relationship between intention and the actual purchase of safe food is needed. Originality/value: This extends the application of the TPB to predict consumer intention to purchase safely certified food in a developing country like Vietnam by examining both direct and indirect effects of socio-demographic variables, trust and past behavior on intention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Consumer Behavior; Food Safety; Intention; Safe Vegetables; Tpb; Vietnam,,,,"This work was funded by QR Program, Kyushu University, Japan.

Given that broader literature on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) suggests a strong positive association between ACEs and cardiometabolic risk or diseases, we hypothesized that parental absence during childhood, which is a major component of ACEs, is more likely to cause MetS in adulthood. Methods Data were obtained from the baseline survey of the Khanh Hoa Cardiovascular Study, in which 3000 residents aged between 40 to 60 years participated. MetS was assessed using the modified Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. It was considered parental absence if the participants had experienced parental absence due to death, divorce, or out-migration before three or between three to 15 years. We used multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the association between parental absence during childhood and metabolic syndrome during adulthood. Results There was no significant association between parental absence and MetS; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76–1.22) for those who experienced parental absence between three to 15 years and the corresponding figure for those who experienced it before three years was 0.93 (95% CI = 0.72–1.20). No significant associations were observed when these were examined for the causes of parental absence. Conclusion This study did not support our hypothesis of an association between parental absence during childhood and metabolic syndrome during adulthood.

We examined the associations between parental absence (i.e., a major component of ACEs) and both underweight and excess weight among middle-aged rural community dwellers in Vietnam, where experiences of parental absence was not uncommon during and after the Vietnam War (1955–1975). Methods: Data came from 3000 middle-aged adults who participated in the baseline survey of Khánh Hòa Cardiovascular Study. Parental absence was defined as parental absence due to death, divorce, or out-migration. Using information on the timing of such events, we categorized participants into those who experienced parental absence before the age of 3, between the ages of 3 and 15, and those without such experiences. BMI was calculated based on measured height and weight (kg/m2) and categorized into three groups: underweight <18.5; normal 18.5–24.9; excess weight ≥ 25. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to investigate the association between parental absence and adult weight status. Results: Parental absence that occurred before the age of 3 was marginally significantly associated with underweight (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95, 2.20) but not with overweight/obesity. Parental divorce was associated with overweight/obesity (RRR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.28, 4.81), but not parental absence due to migratory work. Conclusions: While previous studies in Western settings focused almost exclusively on the risk of obesity in relation to exposure to ACEs, our findings point to the potential importance of considering the risk of underweight in low- and middle-income countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Adult; Body Weight Gain; Child; Human; Middle Aged; Obesity; Preschool Child; Risk Factor; Rural Population; Underweight; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Thinness; Vietnam; Weight Gain","adolescent; adult; body weight gain; child; human; middle aged; obesity; preschool child; risk factor; rural population; underweight; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Thinness; Vietnam; Weight Gain",,,"Funding text 1: National Center for Global Health and Medicine; Pfizer Health Research Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; JSPS Funding information; Funding text 2: This study was financially supported by the Grant of National Center for Global Health and Medicine (Y.I., grant number 19A06); Pfizer Health Research Foundation (Y.I., no grant number); and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (Y.I., grant number 19 K20536), (A.Y., grant number 21 J01171), (D.V.H., grant number 21 K17301).

While many previous conventional attempts to measure resilience at the household level have largely employed the “objective” top-down framework relying mostly on a macro observed socioeconomic dataset, this present work seeks to estimate household resilience through an alternative bottom-up method, called the “subjective” resilience approach. With specific reference to the context of two ethnic Pa Cô and Tà Ôi minorities living in upland areas of Central Vietnam, this study aims to (1) measure household resilience to climate change by scoring five livelihood capitals, financial, human, social, physical, and natural, by applying the Household Livelihood Resilience (HLR) framework; and (2) provide an intersectional lens of ethnicity and gender in relation to the household’s livelihood resilience. To achieve these goals, in addition to two focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews, an empirical survey of 236 households was conducted between September to December 2021. Our findings indicated that there are differences in observed livelihood resilience among the ethnic minority groups and, within that, between gender (sex, status) factors. Ethnic women and poor households have a lower resilience than other groups in society due to their lower human capital and limited access to public and financial resources, which are to some degree linked to the difference in the gender division of labor and the cultural norms of patriarch traditions. This study highlights the importance of considering gender and poverty in resilience-building efforts and offers insights for future programs in multi-ethnic developing countries such as Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Gender; Livelihood Resilience; Poverty Alleviation; Vietnam; Climate Change; Ethnicity; Gender; Household Energy; Labor Division; Livelihood; Poverty Alleviation; Viet Nam,climate change; ethnicity; gender; household energy; labor division; livelihood; poverty alleviation; Viet Nam,,,"This work was financially supported by Hue University under the Core Research Program, Grant No. NCM.DHH.2019.06.","Provisional State of the Global Climate Report 2022; Climate Change 2022 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2022); Dinh, Nguyen Cong, Long-Term Improvement in Precautions for Flood Risk Mitigation: A Case Study in the Low-Lying Area of Central Vietnam, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 12, 2, pp. 250-266, (2021); Nguyen Duc, Kien, Farmers' choices of climate-resilient strategies: Evidence from Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 317, (2021); Nguyen, Yen Thi Bich, Determinants of livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Two minority ethnic communities in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam, Environmental Science and Policy, 123, pp. 11-20, (2021); Phuong, Tran Thi, Livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Indexes and insights from two ethnic minority communities in Central Vietnam, Environmental Challenges, 10, (2023); Sam, Anu Susan, Vulnerabilities to flood hazards among rural households in India, Natural Hazards, 88, 2, pp. 1133-1153, (2017); Zeleke, Getnet, Farmers' livelihood vulnerability to climate-related risks in the North Wello Zone, northern Ethiopia, Environmental and Sustainability Indicators, 17, (2023); Tran, Van Thanh, Nuanced assessment of livelihood resilience through the intersectional lens of gender and ethnicity: Evidence from small-scale farming communities in the upland regions of Vietnam, Journal of Rural Studies, 92, pp. 68-78, (2022); Tanner, Thomas M., Livelihood resilience in the face of climate change, Nature Climate Change, 5, 1, pp. 23-26, (2015)",,MDPI,,,,,,20711050,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149276592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, government authorities plan to implement a wide range of AI-driven healthcare solutions. These include care robots that assist the physically handicapped or elderly, chatbots that provide anonymous online mental health consultation, and diagnostic software utilizing machine learning. Yet one of the most popular smart technologies to augment the nation's already overstrained and undermanned healthcare system is a little known but emerging emotional AI technologies, i.e., deep learning systems trained to read, classify, and respond to human emotions. These technologies are being sold on a commercial level not only to the public but also to rehabilitation centers, local hospitals, and senior citizen residences. Although the augmentation of healthcare services to intelligent machines may seem like a logical step in a country well-known for its long-standing affection toward robots, Japanese society is also known for its adherence to established social relations and traditional institutional practices, especially, in the realm of medical care. In order to gauge Japanese acceptance of emotion-sensing technology, we analyze a dataset of 245 visitors to clinics and hospitals in a typical suburban area in Japan using multiple linear regression. The results show that in general, senior and male patients perceive the emotional AI technology more negatively. For behavioral variables, patients' level of familiarity has positive correlations with attitudes toward emotional AI-based applications in private setting (β<inf>Familiarity_AttitudePri</inf>=0.346, p<0.001) and public setting (β<inf>Familiarity_PublicAttitude</inf>=0.297, p<0.001); while concern for losing control to AI has negative correlations with the attitudes' variables: private setting (β<inf>LosingControl_AttitudePri</inf>=−0.262,p=0.002) and public setting (β <inf>LosingControl_AttitudePub</inf>=-0.188, p=0.044). Interestingly, concerns over violation of privacy and discrimination are non-significant correlates, which contradict the emerging literature on this subject. We further contextualize the findings with insights afforded by an understanding of Japanese culture as well as the relevant literature on care robots in Japan.

Until recently, these devices consisted mainly of GPS tools that track location, software that scrutinizes browser activity and keyboard strokes, and heat/motion sensors that monitor workstation presence. Today, however, a new generation of biometric devices has emerged that can sense, read, monitor and evaluate the affective state of a worker. More popularly known by its commercial moniker, Emotional AI, the technology stems from advancements in affective computing. But whereas previous generations of biometric monitoring targeted the exterior physical body of the worker, concurrent with the writings of Foucault and Hardt, we argue that emotion-recognition tools signal a far more invasive disciplinary gaze that exposes and makes vulnerable the inner regions of the worker-self. Our paper explores attitudes towards empathic surveillance by analyzing a survey of 1015 responses of future job-seekers from 48 countries with Bayesian statistics. Our findings reveal affect tools, left unregulated in the workplace, may lead to heightened stress and anxiety among disadvantaged ethnicities, gender and income class. We also discuss a stark cross-cultural discrepancy whereby East Asians, compared to Western subjects, are more likely to profess a trusting attitude toward EAI-enabled automated management. While this emerging technology is driven by neoliberal incentives to optimize the worksite and increase productivity, ultimately, empathic surveillance may create more problems in terms of algorithmic bias, opaque decisionism, and the erosion of employment relations. Thus, this paper nuances and extends emerging literature on emotion-sensing technologies in the workplace, particularly through its highly original cross-cultural study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Automated Management; Bayesian Analysis; Cross-cultural Perception; Emotional Ai; Biometrics; Emotion Recognition; Human Resource Management; Automated Management; Bayesian Analysis; Biometric Device; Biometrics Technology; Cross-cultural Perceptions; Cultural Determinants; Emotional Ai; Motion Sensors; Sociodemographics; Workers'; Behavioral Research,Biometrics; Emotion Recognition; Human resource management; Automated management; Bayesian Analysis; Biometric device; Biometrics technology; Cross-cultural perceptions; Cultural determinants; Emotional AI; Motion sensors; Sociodemographics; Workers'; Behavioral research,,,Funding text 1: This study is part of the project “Emotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life” funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019).

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of the participation on farmer’s income as well as the major factors that affect the participation in cooperatives by the vegetable farmers in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: The study used primary data collected from vegetable farmers in Vietnam. This study utilized propensity score matching to avoid initial selection bias. The differences between participants and nonparticipants will be adjusted by matching each membership individual to a nonmember based on similar observable characteristics by summarizing the conditional probability of a member given pretreatment characteristics. Findings: This study demonstrates that participation in cooperatives is significantly affected by ethnicity, age of household head, labor involving vegetable production and extension service access. The results of this study also confirm that agricultural cooperatives have positive effects on member farmers to enhance income and that participants – on average – have a higher income than nonparticipants. Research limitations/implications: The method cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias due to unobserved differences between participants and even an appropriate comparison group. Originality/value: This study contributes to an improved understanding about impacts of cooperatives on farmers’ income in developing and emerging economies. Moreover, research also upgrades knowledge regarding the effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives in Vietnam, as well as guides policymakers in supporting the cooperatives in expanding the market and other necessary changes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Cooperatives; Income; Propensity Score Matching,,,,"Funding text 1: This study was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H00960.

The other objective was to provide recommendations for policymakers and manufacturers to promote and customize cargo EVs to meet the requirements of carriers in the LMD sector. Design/methodology/approach: In this study the authors constructed a research framework that adjusted and extended the original technology acceptance model (TAM). The proposed model combines eight psychological factors, including attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement, face consciousness, financial incentive policy and carrier intention, in which four factors, namely attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention, were obtained from the original TAM and the four remaining factors, namely perceived risk, public engagement, face consciousness and financial incentive policy, were added. Findings: The results showed that psychological factors such as attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement and face consciousness might affect carriers' intentions to use electric cargo vehicles in LMD service in Vietnamese cities. These results agree with the previous studies and confirm that attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement and face consciousness might be important for shaping intention to use electric cargo vehicles in emerging markets. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations, first, the data were collected in Vietnam, a country with weak academic contributions. Therefore, these findings might not be generalizable to other areas. The authors expect to apply the same research framework to other countries to explore the similarities and differences across the countries. Second, the authors conducted the surveys in three cities; except for Hanoi, the other two cities are not really large markets in the LMD service sector. Third, the authors ignored the relationship between the demographic characteristics and electric cargo vehicles. Further studies should address this gap. Practical implications: Based on the findings, manufacturers should ensure the high-quality performance of electric cargo vehicles in terms of extending driving range and shortening recharging time. Policymakers should develop the roadmaps for electric cargo vehicles, starting from switching from conventional cargo motorcycles to electric motorcycles. In addition, developing public charging infrastructure should be prioritized, which is the fundamental basis for operating electric cargo vehicles. Finally, manufacturers should research and develop a product that would improve the reputation of carriers because carriers with higher face consciousness are more likely to pursue brand-name and high-priced products in order to enhance their reputation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in two aspects: First, the authors investigated intentions to use electric cargo vehicles in LMD service, which is rare from other studies, and they further identified the psychological determinants of carriers' intentions. Second, the findings increase the knowledge of carriers' intentions and suggest implications for policymakers and manufacturers to promote the adoption of electric cargo vehicles in last-mile deliver service. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carriers' Intentions; Electric Cargo Vehicles; Last-mile Delivery; Psychological Factors,,,,,"Acheampong, Ransford A., Capturing the behavioural determinants behind the adoption of autonomous vehicles: Conceptual frameworks and measurement models to predict public transport, sharing and ownership trends of self-driving cars, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 62, pp. 349-375, (2019); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Allen, Julian, Understanding the impact of e-commerce on last-mile light goods vehicle activity in urban areas: The case of London, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 61, pp. 325-338, (2018); Anosike, Anthony Ikechukwu, Exploring the challenges of electric vehicle adoption in final mile parcel delivery, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 26, 6, pp. 683-707, (2023); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1991); Bao, Yeqing, Face Consciousness and Risk Aversion: Do They Affect Consumer Decision-Making?, Psychology and Marketing, 20, 8, pp. 733-755, (2003); Bearth, Angela, Are risk or benefit perceptions more important for public acceptance of innovative food technologies: A meta-analysis, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 49, pp. 14-23, (2016); Buckley, Lisa D., Psychosocial factors associated with intended use of automated vehicles: A simulated driving study, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 115, pp. 202-208, (2018); Carley, Sanya R., Intent to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle: A survey of early impressions in large US cites, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 18, 1, pp. 39-45, (2013); Cegarra-Navarro, Juan Gabriel, Technology knowledge and governance: Empowering citizen engagement and participation, Government Information Quarterly, 31, 4, pp. 660-668, (2014)",,Emerald Publishing,,,,,,17586550; 09574093,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133956160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the understanding of Quality Physical Education (QPE) from the perspective of PE professionals primarily entrusted with implementing initiatives to develop QPE. A total of 2,191 individuals from 25 Asian cities participated in this study. They completed a validated QPE questionnaire consisting of 49 items distributed into eight dimensions. The variables of gender, work position, and years of experience were investigated in accounting for the differences in perceptions. The overall mean value for QPE was 7.32, with excellent internal consistency (a= .986). The results indicated similar trends in the perceptions of the QPE and evaluation of the items by professionals. No significant differences between genders and across work positions were found. However, significant differences were found among perceptions depending on the years of experience in teaching PE. Moreover, findings revealed the need for governmental support for research in PE and collaborative work at the international and national levels.

According to its recent Power Development Plan 7, coal-fired power sources account for almost half of both total installed capacity and production of electricity, and this is expected to increase to more than half of the power sources by 2030. Regarding finance, the increasing Chinese dominance is expected because of the lack of other financial resources caused by the country’s heavy debt ratio and international withdrawal from coal financing. Consequently, least cost systems will be installed and implemented, which could cause serious environmental damage on a local scale. This scenario has led local governments to veto the central push for coal fired-plants, which casts doubt on the effectiveness of the current national plan. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Chinese Finance; Coal-fired Power Plant; Local Government; Vietnam,,,,,"Inception Report Prepared by Intelligent Energy Systems and Energy Market Consulting Associates, (2017); Global Fossil Fuel Divestment and Clean Energy Investment Movement, (2016); Ministry of Constructions News Piece, (2016); Authored by Morgan and Wang, (2015); Counting all of the Costs Choosing the Right Mix of Electricity Sources in Vietnam to 2025, (2017); Chinas Global Energy Finance, (2017); Decision 1195 on Special Mechanisms and Policies Granted to Urgent Power Projects, (2005); Decision 428 Qd Ttg on Revised National Power Development Master Plan for the 20112020 Period with Vision to 2030; Coal Fired Power Plants Development A Project Finance Persepctive, (2017); Vietnam China Trade Might Reach 100 Billion in 2018, (2018)",,Elsevier,,,,,,,9780128173510; 9780128173503,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190062602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The former is about relevancy where as the latter is about affirmation (or conclusion). While relevancy and affirmation are two different concepts, there is obviously a connection between them. That is why performing retrieval and textual entailment sequentially and independently may not make the most of this mutually supportive relationship. This paper, therefore, propose a multi-task learning model for these two tasks to improve their performance. Technically, in the COLIEE dataset, we use the information of Task 4 (conclusions) to improve the performance of Task 3 (searching for legal provisions related to the question). Our empirical findings indicate that this supportive relationship truly exists. This important insight sheds light on how leveraging relationship between tasks can significantly enhance the effectiveness of our multi-task learning approach for legal text processing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computational Linguistics; Information Retrieval; Learning Systems; Joint Learning; Learning Models; Legal Provisions; Legal Texts; Multitask Learning; Performance; Relevant Documents; Text Retrieval; Text-processing; Textual Entailment; Text Processing,Computational linguistics; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Joint learning; Learning models; Legal provisions; Legal texts; Multitask learning; Performance; Relevant documents; Text retrieval; Text-processing; Textual entailment; Text processing,,,"This work was supported by the AIP challenge funding related with JST, AIP Trilateral AI Research, Grant Number JPMJCR20G4.","Abolghasemi, Amin, Improving BERT-based Query-by-Document Retrieval with Multi-task Optimization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13186 LNCS, pp. 3-12, (2022); Askari, Arian, Combining lexical and neural retrieval with longformer-based summarization for effective case law retrieval, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2950, pp. 162-170, (2021); Sixteenth International Workshop on Juris Informatics Jurisin, (2022); Elnaggar, Ahmed, Multi-task deep learning for legal document translation, summarization and multi-label classification, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 9-15, (2018); Katz, Daniel Martin, Complex societies and the growth of the law, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Improving Generalization Performance by Switching from Adam to Sgd, (2017); Kim, Mi-young, Statute law information retrieval and entailment, pp. 283-289, (2019); Kim, Mi-young, COLIEE 2022 Summary: Methods for Legal Document Retrieval and Entailment, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13859 LNAI, pp. 51-67, (2023); Louis, Antoine, Finding the Law: Enhancing Statutory Article Retrieval via Graph Neural Networks, pp. 2753-2768, (2023); Proc of the 2011 Asru Workshop, (2011)","Preotiuc-Pietro, D.; Goanta, C.; Chalkidis, I.; Barrett, L.; Spanakis, G.; Aletras, N.",Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL),Bloomberg Engineering; European Research Council Starting Grant project HUMANads,"5th Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop, NLLP 2023",,Singapore,196547,,9.79889E+12,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185005306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first step in understanding innovation implementation is to identify its driving factors. However, these factors remain unclear in the context of agricultural corporations. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors associated with the product innovation implementation in Japanese agricultural corporations. A probit model was used to identify these driven factors by using the data of 308 corporations from the national survey in 2019. The results showed that 20.5% (nâ€‰=â€‰63) of corporations were rice corporations. Most corporations (38.6%, nâ€‰=â€‰199) generated an annual sales revenue of 100 to 300 million yen. Further, 50.0% of corporations implemented product innovation, that is, these corporations started to produce and sell new or significantly improved goods or launched new or significantly improved services. The results also show that corporations that generate high annual sales, seek high number of sales, aim for profit margins of 5–15%, and believe more strongly in their ability to innovate tend to implement product innovation. Contrastingly, corporations that have a profit margin between 1 and 10% are less likely to implement product innovation than those breaking even. Corporations that mainly deal in facility vegetables or livestock products also tend to implement product innovation less than the corporations mainly selling rice. The corporations with higher self-evaluation in new product and technology development tend to implement more product innovation. Overall, the results suggest that a certain level of annual sales might be required for innovation, innovating farms seek growth and set high targets, and innovations are stimulated by hight self-evaluation in new product and technology development. Therefore, to promote product innovation in Japanese agricultural corporations, these factors should be considered. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Castillo-Valero, Juan Sebastián, Factors that determine innovation in agrifood firms, Agronomy, 11, 5, (2021); Feder, Gershon, Adoption of agricultural innovations in developing countries: a survey., Economic Development and Cultural Change, 33, 2, pp. 255-298, (1985); Hashi, Iraj, The impact of innovation activities on firm performance using a multi-stage model: Evidence from the Community Innovation Survey 4, Research Policy, 42, 2, pp. 353-366, (2013); Läpple, Doris, Measuring and understanding the drivers of agricultural innovation: Evidence from Ireland, Food Policy, 51, pp. 1-8, (2015); Fy 2018 Summary of the Annual Report on Food Agriculture and Rural Areas in Japan, (2019); Smart Agriculture Practice in Ricefarming and Perspective of Farm in Nextgeneration, (2019); Agriculture and Forestry Statistics Publishing Inc, (2021); 10th Asian Society Agricultural Economist International Conference, (2021); Oslo Manual Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Innovation Data, (2005); Innovation in Firms A Microeconomic Perspective, (2009)",,Springer Nature,,,,,,,9789811990854; 9789811990861,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173404685,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no study on profit efficiency of VietGAP tea producers, which are therefore barriers for farmers and policymakers in terms of extending the tea production practice in Vietnam. Thus, this study investigated the profit efficiency of tea production practices using a stochastic profit frontier function. We applied propensity score matching to control for self- selection in assessing the profit efficiency of VietGAP and conventional tea farming. Our results indicated that the average profit efficiency of tea farmers was around 74%, suggesting 26% of profit was lost due to inefficiency. Furthermore, significant different profit efficiency was observed between the two farmer groups. We further found that tea farmers with larger production scale, better irrigation system, accessing extension service are more likely to adopt VietGAP tea practices than others are. Thus, public policies should focus on improving profit efficiency and facilitating adoption of eco-friendly production practice, and also supporting innovations to improve farmers’ production conditions, including the access to extension service, irrigation system, enlarged farm size, and labor-saving machinery. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Abdulai, Awudu Mumin, Structural adjustment and economic efficiency of rice farmers in Northern Ghana, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 48, 3, pp. 503-520, (2000); Making Markets Work Better for the Poor the Value Chain for Tea in Vietnam Prospects for Participation of the Poor, (2004); Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Wasim Aktar, Md, Impact of pesticides use in agriculture: Their benefits and hazards, Interdisciplinary Toxicology, 2, 1, pp. 1-12, (2009); Ali, Mubarak, Economic efficiency of small farmers in a changing world: A survey of recent evidence, Journal of International Development, 3, 1, pp. 1-27, (1991); Ali, Mubarik, Profit efficiency among Basmati rice producers in Pakistan Punjab, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 71, 2, pp. 303-310, (1989); Arnade, Carlos Anthony, Estimating a profit function in the presence of inefficiency: An application to Russian agriculture, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 27, 1, pp. 94-113, (2002); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Caliendo, Marco, Some practical guidance for the implementation of propensity score matching, Journal of Economic Surveys, 22, 1, pp. 31-72, (2008)",,Springer Nature,,,,,,,9789811990854; 9789811990861,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173398414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that 175 out of 183 corporations had adopted at least one ICT&SF technology until 2019, indicating an overall adoption rate of 95.6%. Majority (84.7%) of corporations were limited companies and stock companies, and 86.9% of the corporations were qualified to own farmlands. Regarding the profile of corporate representatives, over one third of the representatives graduated from universities. Based on the empirical results, corporate forms, eligibility to own farmland, sales targets, profit targets, main product and self-evaluation of ICT utilization and information management significantly affected the adoption of ICT&SF technologies adoption. In terms of the characteristics of corporate representatives, those who graduated from specialized schools and vocational colleges tended to adopt more ICT&SF technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Bucci, Giorgia, Factors affecting ict adoption in agriculture: A case study in italy, Quality - Access to Success, 20, S2, pp. 122-129, (2019); Cameron, A.

Following these types of innovations, this chapter categorizes the types of agricultural innovations adopted in Asian countries over time into three main groups. These are product and process innovation, marketing and organizational innovation, and social innovations by institutional changes and welfare. Measuring the impact of agricultural innovations on farming and rural welfare is also summarized on three aspects, namely, production, economics, and welfare in Asian countries.

Studies have yet to investigate not only the institutional factors affecting VietGAHP adoption in household pig farming, but also the impact of such adoption on its criteria’ implementation. The objective of this chapter is to investigate the factors associated with VietGAHP adoption in household pig production and its impact on implementing its criteria. A Probit model was used to directly indicate the determinants of VietGAHP adoption, and a z test revealed the VietGAHP’s impact by comparing the differences in each criterion’s compliance rates between adopter and non-adopter groups. The results demonstrate that the factors positively contributing to VietGAHP adoption include gender, training, household income, and veterinary services, with the training factor as a substantial contributor. The factors presenting a challenge to this adoption included farm size, the number of family members participating in pig-raising, off-farm income, and biogas, with the latter an especially pivotal factor. Moreover, an expected result of the government’s support was that VietGAHP adoption had a positive impact on 9 out 15 compulsory practices and 8 of 14 optional practices. These imply that to attain food safety and environmental protection goals through a public GAP program for pig production, traditional adoption factors—including a male farmer status, training, household wealth, and veterinary services—remain key pillars on which government policies should focus. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Ali, Jaffar, Farmer’s perception regarding constraints faced in adoption of dairy farming practices in Sindh province, Pakistan, Tropical Animal Health and Production, 51, 6, pp. 1707-1715, (2019); Asfaw, Solomon, Impact of modern agricultural technologies on smallholder welfare: Evidence from Tanzania and Ethiopia, Food Policy, 37, 3, pp. 283-295, (2012); Manual on Good Agricultural Practices Gap, (2016); Baumgart-Getz, Adam, Why farmers adopt best management practice in the United States: A meta-analysis of the adoption literature, Journal of Environmental Management, 96, 1, pp. 17-25, (2012); Brouder, Sylvie M., The impact of conservation agriculture on smallholder agricultural yields: A scoping review of the evidence, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 187, pp. 11-32, (2014); Coulibaly, Jeanne Y., Adoption of agroforestry and the impact on household food security among farmers in Malawi, Agricultural Systems, 155, pp. 52-69, (2017); Feder, Gershon, Adoption of agricultural innovations in developing countries: a survey., Economic Development and Cultural Change, 33, 2, pp. 255-298, (1985); Ghimire, Raju, Factors Affecting Adoption of Improved Rice Varieties among Rural Farm Households in Central Nepal, Rice Science, 22, 1, pp. 35-43, (2015); Journal of Economics and Developments, (2016); Gillespie, Jeffrey M., Why don't producers adopt best management practices?

Recently, the proportion of high-tech agricultural products has increased; however, output quality and quantity have not reached the expectations. There are many possible reasons, one of which is that farmers lack skill, experience, and knowledge to receive and generate information sources. This chapter estimated the technical efficiency levels and identified the information factors that influence the technical inefficiency of crop farmers in the northwest highland of Vietnam using farm-level data. The results show that there are significant opportunities to increase technical inefficiency and no farm has full technical efficiency. Agricultural information from printed materials and frequent watching of television were significantly and negatively related to technical inefficiency. This indicates that if farmers read more agricultural information from printed materials and watch television related to social life at appropriate times, the technical efficiency of crop farms would increase. Based on the results, some suggestions are proposed to optimize crop-farm technical efficiency and increase the effectiveness of using information sources. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Japanese Journal of Farm Management, (2013); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Battese, George E., ESTIMATION OF A PRODUCTION FRONTIER MODEL: WITH APPLICATION TO THE PASTORAL ZONE OF EASTERN AUSTRALIA, Australian Journal of Agricultural Economics, 21, 3, pp. 169-179, (1977); Digital Economy and Digital Transformation in Vietnam, (2020); Boz, Ismet, Factors influencing the adoption of maize in Kahramanmaras province of Turkey, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 33, SUPPL. 3, pp. 431-440, (2005); Bravo-Ureta, Boris E., Technical, economic, and allocative efficiency in peasant farming: Evidence from the Dominican Republic, Developing Economies, 35, 1, pp. 48-67, (1997); Guide to Frontier Version 4 1 A Computer Program for Stochastic Frontier Production and Cost Function Estimation, (1996); Coelli, Tim J., Identification of factors which influence the technical inefficiency of Indian farmers, Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 40, 2, pp. 103-128, (1996); Coelli, Tim J., An introduction to efficiency and productivity analysis, pp. 1-349, (2005)",,Springer Nature,,,,,,,9789811990854; 9789811990861,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173320140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first step, we review prior research to identify the service-oriented supply chain’s distinctive features and typical risks. In the second step, the resonant effect of these risks on service-oriented supply chain performance is examined by an empirical study in the construction sector that was hit hard during COVID-19. In doing so, a model comparing the single impacts of risks on supply chain performance to the theoretical model was developed to confirm the resonant effect mechanism. Obtained from 196 service-oriented firms in Vietnam’s construction, our study found that the resonant effect model explained 63% of service-oriented supply chain performance variance versus 46.3% in the comparative model. The influence of a single risk on supply chain performance is also more significant, proving the resonant mechanism influence. Another interesting result is the low-impact demand risk on supply chain performance, reinforcing the service-oriented supply chain advantage. The notion for resonant effect reduction is minimising the coefficient of “a” to limit/eliminate risks’ relationship. Hence, the proposed resonant effect model can serve as a guide. Our recommendation to embrace supply chain management strategies, such as avoidance, speculation, and postponement, should be balanced with acceptable cost/benefit trade-offs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Resonant Effect; Risk Management; Service-dominant Logic; Supply Chain Management; Supply Chain Risk Management,,,,,"Truong Quang, Huy, Supply chain management practices and firms’ operational performance, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 34, 2, pp. 176-193, (2017); Duong, Thi Binh An, Supply chain management and organizational performance: the resonant influence, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 36, 7, pp. 1053-1077, (2019); Lusch, Robert Frank, Reframing supply chain management: A service-dominant logic perspective, Journal of Supply Chain Management, 47, 1, pp. 14-18, (2011); Truong Quang, Huy, The push effect of risks on supply chain performance: service-oriented firms, Business Process Management Journal, 25, 7, pp. 1734-1758, (2019); Tokman, Mert, Supply chain networks and service-dominant logic: Suggestions for future research, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 41, 7, pp. 717-726, (2011); Randall, Wesley S., Service-dominant logic and supply chain management: Are we there yet?, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 44, 1, pp. 113-131, (2014); Altuntas-Vural, Ceren, Service-dominant logic and supply chain management: a systematic literature review, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 32, 8, pp. 1109-1124, (2017); Maas, Steffen, Supply chain services from a service-dominant perspective: A content analysis, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 44, 1, pp. 58-79, (2014); Flint, Daniel John, The supply chain management of shopper marketing as viewed through a service ecosystem lens, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 44, 1, pp. 23-38, (2014); Truong Quang, Huy, Supply chain risk management: Manufacturing- and service-oriented firms, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 29, 2, pp. 218-239, (2018)",,Springer Nature,,,,,,,9789819915453; 9789819915446,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171497812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methodology/Approach: The data sample including 135 Vietnamese manufacturing plants was collected through a paper-based questionnaire survey. Statistical techniques such as correlation and regression analysis are applied for hypotheses testing. Findings: It was shown that supply chain performs better when focal firms invest in supplier development and knowledge absorption. Those activities are strengthened by developing IT link and information sharing with suppliers and by customers. Research Limitation/Implication: Sample size is relatively small due to limited time and resources; subjective measurement of constructs are limitations that can be addressed in future research. Originality/Value of paper: This paper fills the gap in literature related with application of supply chain information in developing countries. It indicated that IT links should be regarded as the platform for information sharing among supply chain partners which lead to higher supply chain performance.

We explored the underlying socio-cultural environment of marginalized communities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to ascertain why these groups participate in a malaria elimination project, through 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork, including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, informal conversations, and observation. Findings show various reasonings and motivations of these communities to use participation. In Vietnam, the Stieng and M’nong ethnic minority groups used participation to protest ethnic inequalities and abuses. In Laos, the Brao ethnic minority group feigned participation to deter outside interference in their traditional spaces and identity. In Cambodia, marginalized Khmer and Cham communities actively participated in the project to tailor community development. The paper concludes that participation in health interventions was consistently manipulated as a strategy to protect or nurture community identity and further socio-cultural and political interests. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Community Participation; Development; Ethnic Minority; Hegemony; Malaria Elimination; Marginalized Community; Community Development; Disease Control; Ethnic Minority; Ethnography; Hegemony; Local Participation; Malaria; Participatory Approach; Cambodia; Laos; Viet Nam,community development; disease control; ethnic minority; ethnography; hegemony; local participation; malaria; participatory approach; Cambodia; Laos; Viet Nam,,,"This study was contracted by PSI, funded under Gates Foundation Project, by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The former often depends on the latter (which includes the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual sub-elements). Trip satisfaction, nevertheless, is usually measured after the trip has finished. Thus, a lag effect may have certain impacts on the evaluations. In addition, the influences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on tourists’satisfaction, in general, and their emotions, in particular, have not yet been considered. The purpose of this study is to examine tourists’ in-situ emotions by tracing their antecedents, including the above-mentioned factors and those beyond them. Using data collected from one young tourist sample (n = 298) in Vietnam, this study found that the intrapersonal element of “nonverbal communication skills,” the interpersonal element of “relationship satisfaction,” and the contextual elements of “destination attributes” and “symbolic values” were influencers of these tourists’ positive emotions. The situational elements of “COVID-19 self-efficacy” and “COVID-19 fear” did not have positive impacts.

Moreover, with the threshold model, the results show that countries with institutional quality above the threshold will increase the stability of banks. In addition, macroeconomic and banking characteristics variables such as total assets, income diversification, quality of control, inflation, and GDP growth rate have a high significance in the model. Research, Practical & Social implications: The study shows The study's empirical results have specific policy implications for the Government in implementing policies related to institutional quality to improve bank stability. Originality/value: there are not many researches done to investigate institutional quality to improve bank stability. Moreover, from economic crisis, the matter of banking stability is among main concerns of many researches. Second, previous researches just focus on the aspect of corruption and ignore other aspects or other factors.

The effects of droughts on crop production, household expenditure, rural poverty and internal migration in Vietnam were investigated using a unique panel dataset while controlling for potential issues that could lead to biased estimations. We find comprehensive evidence that droughts not only caused a significant decline in rice productivity and rural household consumption, but also pushed them into poverty. Furthermore, droughts are strongly linked to rural people's decisions to migrate to other areas, pushing migration decisions through the productivity, consumption and poverty channels. Understanding the complex relationship between climate change, particularly drought, and its consequences is critical for developing policy interventions to help rural populations cope with climate change risks and uncertainties. These findings emphasize the importance of increasing rural populations’ resilience to climate-related extreme events to mitigate their interconnected effects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Drought-induced Impacts; Farming Households; Rice Production; Vietnam,,,,"This work was supported by University of Economics, Hue University; Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED): [Grant Number 504.05-2020.302]; Strong Research Group Program of Hue University.","Adego, Tsega, The impact of adaptation practices on crop productivity in northwest Ethiopia: an endogenous switching estimation, Development Studies Research, 6, 1, pp. 129-141, (2019); Akaakohol, Msoo A., Diversification and farm household welfare in Makurdi, Benue state, Nigeria, Development Studies Research, 1, 1, pp. 168-175, (2014); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Natural Disasters, Household Welfare, and Resilience: Evidence from Rural Vietnam, World Development, 70, pp. 59-77, (2015); undefined, (2021); Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, (2019); Barrios, Salvador, Climatic change and rural-urban migration: The case of sub-Saharan Africa, Journal of Urban Economics, 60, 3, pp. 357-371, (2006); Beine, Michel, Climatic factors as determinants of international migration, Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 117, 2, pp. 723-767, (2015); Berlemann, Michael, Climate change, natural disasters, and migration-a survey of the empirical evidence, CESifo Economic Studies, 63, 4, pp. 353-385, (2017); Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, (2020); Black, Richard, Climate change: Migration as adaptation, Nature, 478, 7370, pp. 447-449, (2011)",,Routledge,,,,,,21665095,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153400132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One important reason for this limitation is the absence of valid and reliable measurement of risk, resulting in the impossibility to discriminate between risk constructs. Therefore, the current study is performed to develop and then validate a measurement scale of risk in sustainable construction SCs. The data are collected from a large-scale survey supported by the Japanese government to promote sustainable socioeconomic development for the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region, with the participation of 283 firms in Vietnam. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are used to test the reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the risk constructs. The results indicate that all tests strongly support the measurement scale, and seven reliable risk constructs are identified including supply, demand, internal processes, information, financial, time, and environmental risks.

We use the national representative data of the Vietnam Demographic Health Survey from 1997 and 2002 to investigate the effect of maternal education on three child health indicators: neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality rates. We took advantage of the tuition fee introduction in the lower secondary school level in 1989 to create an exogenous negative shock of educational environment for women. Our results first show that women who were exposed to the tuition fee introduction, on average, have 0.652 less years of schooling, compared to their counterparts. Using this exogenous reduction in educational attainment, our results show that a one-year reduction in maternal education led to increases in neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality rates by approximately 2.4, 3.0, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. The shorter years of female education possibly hasten her age at first marriage and thus, age at first birth, which would contribute to unmatured and/or risky pregnancy and delivery.

In this backdrop, a number of studies document the causal links between hot money and financial markets. Accordingly, the study examines the causal relationship among hot money, equities, and real estate assets in the small-scale economy of Pakistan. For this purpose, we employ various time series techniques such as the JJ Co-integration test, Granger causality tests, Impulse Response Functions (IRF), and Variance Decomposition Analysis (VDC). The findings validate the long-term association between speculative funds and underlying investment markets. The results uncover unidirectional causality from investment markets to hot money in Pakistan. However, the lack of a bi-directional relationship among the underlying variables indicates that hot money is not a major driver of soaring prices in equities and real estate assets. Alternatively, developing the underlying markets attracts speculative cash inflows into the economy. The findings of the study highlight some useful implications for investors and regulators. For instance, the study's findings present valuable insights for international investors seeking diversification opportunities in small-scale economies such as Pakistan. Also, the regulators in the underlying economy can utilize the study findings to formulate an optimal model to manage international capital flows. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Causal Relationship; Hot Money; Real Estate Sector; Stock Market; Capital Flow; Economy Of Scale; Financial Market; Stock Market; Pakistan,capital flow; economy of scale; financial market; stock market; Pakistan,,,"The article is sponsored by the Grant-in-Aid for the Excellent Young Researcher of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT) and the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (No. 22K13432) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).","undefined, (2021); Financial Capital Flows in the US Balance of Payments, (1968); Journal of Applied Economics, (1998); Chari, Varadarajan V., Hot money, Journal of Political Economy, 111, 6, pp. 1262-1292, (2003); Chen, Junhua, One decade of urban housing reform in China: Urban housing price dynamics and the role of migration and urbanization, 1995-2005, Habitat International, 35, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Chiang, Mingchu, Importance of proper monetary liquidity: Sustainable development of the housing and stock markets, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 21, pp. 1-21, (2020); Dekker, Arie, Equity market linkages in the Asia Pacific region: A comparison of the orthogonalised and generalised VAR approaches, Global Finance Journal, 12, 1, pp. 1-33, (2001); Domowitz, Ian, Market segmentation and stock prices: Evidence from an emerging market, Journal of Finance, 52, 3, pp. 1059-1085, (1997); Ferreira, Miguel A., The colors of investors' money: The role of institutional investors around the world, Journal of Financial Economics, 88, 3, pp. 499-533, (2008); Filer, Larry H., Large capital inflows to Korea: The traditional developing economy story?, Journal of Asian Economics, 15, 1, pp. 99-110, (2004)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,,,,1331677X,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138249497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using consumer price index (CPI) data from 18 developed countries to evaluate these models, we find that the GARCH models are generally outperformed by their stochastic volatility counterparts. Furthermore, the stochastic volatility in mean (SV-M) model is shown to be the best for all 18 countries considered. The paper also examines which model characteristics play a main role in modelling inflation rates. It turns out that inflation volatility feedback is a crucial feature that we should take into consideration when modelling inflation rates. The relevance of a leverage effect, however, is found to be rather ambiguous. Finally, the forecasting results using the log predictive score confirm these findings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bayes Factor; Garch; Inflation Volatility; Log Predictive Score; Marginal Likelihood; Stochastic Volatility; Bayesian Analysis; Comparative Study; Inflation; Modeling; Stochasticity,Bayesian analysis; comparative study; inflation; modeling; stochasticity,,,"I would like to thank Shinichi Nishiyama and Shuhei Takahashi for helpful comments and suggestions.

In construction, some review-based papers have been done to cover various issues in supply chain risk management (SCRM) such as risks associated with the adoption of supply chain management. However, limited review papers have been conducted to comprehensively classify supply chain risk (SCR) types and/or analyze SCRM processes (i.e. risk identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and risk monitoring). Therefore, this study aims to overcome such shortcomings of previous literature reviews by applying a review process with six specific stages. Accordingly, 30 relevant papers published during over the last two decades are first extracted from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Then, descriptive and content analyses are used to review these papers. It is found that a considerable amount of focus has been devoted to identifying and assessing risks while mitigating and monitoring risks have not yet received much attention from researchers. Finally, research gaps and opportunities are presented to guide further studies.

The aims of this research were to: (1) explore the individual- and country-level determinants of intentions to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, and (2) examine worldwide variation in vaccination intentions. This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic, involving 6697 respondents across 20 countries. Results showed that 72.9% of participants reported positive intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19, whereas 16.8% were undecided, and 10.3% reported they would not be vaccinated. At the individual level, prosociality was a significant positive predictor of vaccination intentions, whereas generic beliefs in conspiracy theories and religiosity were negative predictors. Country-level determinants, including cultural dimensions of individualism/collectivism and power distance, were not significant predictors of vaccination intentions. Altogether, this study identifies individual-level predictors that are common across multiple countries, provides further evidence on the importance of combating conspiracy theories, involving religious institutions in vaccination campaigns, and stimulating prosocial motives to encourage vaccine uptake. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Covid-19 Vaccines; Sars-cov-2 Vaccine; Behavior; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Human; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Vaccination; Covid-19; Covid-19 Vaccines; Cross-sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; Sars-cov-2; Vaccination,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; human; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,,COVID-19 Vaccines,"This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi [VCDSF/75-71015], The University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III [COV20/00086], co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) ”A way to make Europe.”","Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Solís Arce, Julio S., COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in low- and middle-income countries, Nature Medicine, 27, 8, pp. 1385-1394, (2021); International Review of Social Psychology, (2005); Handbook of Social Psychology, (1998); van Bavel, Jay Joseph, Using social and behavioural science to support COVID-19 pandemic response, Nature Human Behaviour, 4, 5, pp. 460-471, (2020); Böhm, Robert, Exploring and Promoting Prosocial Vaccination: A Cross-Cultural Experiment on Vaccination of Health Care Personnel, BioMed Research International, 2016, (2016); Böhm, Robert, The willingness to vaccinate increases when vaccination protects others who have low responsibility for not being vaccinated, Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 42, 3, pp. 381-391, (2019); Bruder, Martin, Measuring individual differences in generic beliefs in conspiracy theories across cultures: Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Cichocka, Aleksandra, They will not control us': Ingroup positivity and belief in intergroup conspiracies, British Journal of Psychology, 107, 3, pp. 556-576, (2016)",,Routledge,,,,,,15327027; 10410236,038726115X; 9780387261157,,35081848,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124147547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Findings show that GE crops have not been only targeted in input traits like GM crops, but also strengthened production ability in harsh environmental conditions, improving product quality and enhancement nutrition. Especially, these consumer-targeted traits pursued in GE applications could rise consumer acceptance. Consumer-targeted traits coupled with transgene-free crops has created a more balanced risk-benefit perception and given momentum to GE foods production. Nevertheless, the public has failed to distinguish bio-technologies, and regulators are treating GM and GE foods alike. Thus, it is vital to increase knowledge, communication and policy orientation. Policymakers should carefully assess novel bio-technologies and apply an appropriate regulatory approach to GE foods to promote the agricultural system and food safety. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Biotechnology; Crispr; Genetic Engineering; Genetically Modified Food; Genome Edited Food,,,,,"Abe, Kiyomi, Production of high oleic/low linoleic rice by genome editing, Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 131, pp. 58-62, (2018); Aldemita, Rhodora R., Trends in global approvals of biotech crops (1992-2014), GM Crops and Food, 6, 3, pp. 150-166, (2015); European Regions and the Knowledge Deficit Model in M Bauer and G Gaskell Eds Biotechnology the Making of A Global Controversy Pp 224 43, (2002); Gatica-Arias, Andrés M., Consumer attitudes toward food crops developed by CRISPR/Cas9 in Costa Rica, Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, 139, 2, pp. 417-427, (2019); Ashokkumar, Shanthinie, Creation of novel alleles of fragrance gene OsBADH2 in rice through CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing, PLOS ONE, 15, 8 August, (2020); Barman, Hirendra Nath, Generation of a new thermo-sensitive genic male sterile rice line by targeted mutagenesis of TMS5 gene through CRISPR/Cas9 system, BMC Plant Biology, 19, 1, (2019); Batista, Rita, Facts and fiction of genetically engineered food, Trends in Biotechnology, 27, 5, pp. 277-286, (2009); Bøhn, Thomas, Compositional differences in soybeans on the market: Glyphosate accumulates in Roundup Ready GM soybeans, Food Chemistry, 153, pp. 207-215, (2014); Bredahl, Lone, Consumer attitudes and decision-making with regard to genetically engineered food products - A review of the literature and a presentation of models for future research, Journal of Consumer Policy, 21, 3, pp. 251-277, (1998); Butt, Haroon, Efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing using a chimeric single-guide RNA molecule, Frontiers in Plant Science, 8, (2017)",,Routledge,,,,,,15286983; 08974438,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121695823,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the global numbers of mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68% from 1970 to 2016. One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably, perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast, perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government’s and international organizations’ funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,"We would like to send our gratitude to our colleagues, family, and friends for supporting us during the research, especially Prof. Vuong Quan Hoang (Phenikaa University).

However, understanding of service quality and satisfaction relations has been limited. This study seeks an appropriate method to demonstrate the nature of service quality-satisfaction relations. Thereby, research results can be methodologically, theoretically, and empirically defensible. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) and the three-factor theory, the most widely preferred for public transport service quality prioritization based on the importance of service factors to rider satisfaction, will be utilized. The study takes transit service in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, to demonstrate that the three-factor theory, which has been limitedly utilized despite being more advantageous and robust, is superior to the IPA. Although the extent to which the service quality factors affect satisfaction varied across rider segments, the types of service quality factors were found consistent. For example, captive riders considered all service factors as performance. Non-captive riders considered the environment factor as excitement. No basic factor was found across rider groups. This study contributes to the limited understanding of the non-linear and asymmetric relations between service quality and satisfaction of various rider groups, which is rarely found in transit service quality literature. Furthermore, it introduced a case study of Vietnamese urban transit services for the first time. It suggests that enhancing passenger information, rider care, and comfort are recommended as the most practical and economical measures in the short run. However, the city government should improve availability and accessibility to promote public transport ridership in the long run. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Importance-performance Analysis; Public Transport; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segments; Service Quality; Three-factor Theory; Factor Analysis; Quality Control; Importance-performance Analysis; Prioritization; Public Transport; Public Transport Service; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segment; Service Quality; Service Satisfaction; Three-factor Theory; Transit Services; Quality Of Service; Performance Assessment; Prioritization; Public Transport; Service Quality; Strategic Approach; Viet Nam,Factor analysis; Quality control; Importance-performance analysis; Prioritization; Public transport; Public transport service; Rider satisfaction; Rider segment; Service Quality; Service satisfaction; Three-factor theory; Transit services; Quality of service; performance assessment; prioritization; public transport; service quality; strategic approach; Viet Nam,,,Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the World Bank for the data.

Since 1986, Vietnam has adopted an open economic policy and promoted trade activities. Therefore, Vietnam’s exports have significantly increased and contributed to economic development. The benefits of exports are undeniable, but Vietnam also faces serious environmental problems caused by these activities. This paper analyzes the impact of Vietnam’s export activities on economics and the environment through comparison between carbon emissions and value-added embodied in exports using an input–output model, then provides some recommendations to adjust Vietnam's export strategy in the future. The main findings indicate that carbon dioxide emissions (CO<inf>2</inf>) embodied in exports have increased from 2006 to 2015. The carbon intensity of exports increases, while the value-added intensity decreases. As compared with production for the domestic market, production for domestic demand creates faster value-added and slower carbon emissions than production for exports. This study suggests that Vietnam should reform its export structure alongside technological improvements and other policy adjustments to curb Vietnam’s growing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Emissions; Economics; Environment; Exports; Value-added; Vietnam,,,,I am grateful to the reviewers for suggestions that greatly improved the paper.,"Banerjee, Suvajit, Addressing the Drivers of Carbon Emissions Embodied in Indian Exports: An Index Decomposition Analysis, Foreign Trade Review, 54, 4, pp. 300-333, (2019); Su, Bin, Input-output analysis of CO2 emissions embodied in trade: Competitive versus non-competitive imports, Energy Policy, 56, pp. 83-87, (2013); Journal of Economics and International Finance, (2011); Chaponnière, Jean Raphaë, Vietnam's export-led growth model and competition with China, Economie Internationale, 118, 2, pp. 101-130, (2009); Chen, Xikang, The estimation of domestic value-added and employment induced by exports: An application to Chinese exports to the United States, pp. 64-82, (2008); Dietzenbacher, Erik, Trade, production fragmentation, and China's carbon dioxide emissions, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 64, 1, pp. 88-101, (2012); Taking Stock an Update on Vietnams Recent Economic Developments Special Focus Reform Priorities for Reducing Trade Costs and Enhancing Competitiveness in Vietnam English, (2018); Eora Global Mrio, (2015); Fan, Bin, Trade openness and carbon leakage: Empirical evidence from China's industrial sector, Energies, 12, 6, (2019); Peters, Glen P., From production-based to consumption-based national emission inventories, Ecological Economics, 65, 1, pp. 13-23, (2008)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,21932409,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138062108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Checklists are one of the ways that can help students identify the most important pieces of information. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed at examining the impact of using educational checklists on the learning process of postgraduate students at Nagasaki University, Japan. Methods: Thirty-one Master's students, who finished a “how to write a research protocol” course were recruited by sending them an invitation email that had an attached link to a previously developed and tested questionnaire on the SurveyMonkey® platform. After signing the electronic informed consent, twenty-two participants (response rate = 71%) finished the survey. The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and expressed in the form of frequencies and percentages. Results: More than half of the students declared that they know the checklist will be used in the course that we investigated. Only two students used checklists as a means of studying (9%). Twelve students (55%) confirmed that no other courses or lessons in the School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health (TMGH) use checklists. No students found the usage of checklists not easy or not practical to apply. Many students thought the length of the checklist was suitable and not too short (64%), although three students (14%) found it lengthy. Moreover, most students described the checklist as beyond good (86%) and they would recommend using a checklist for teaching other college students (73%). Conclusion: Using checklists in education can facilitate the learning process, help in memorization, and deepen the concepts being studied. Further studies are required to examine the impact of checklists in teaching undergraduate students and students from other non-healthcare disciplines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Checklist; Research Education; Teaching Improvement; Adult; Article; Checklist; Clinical Article; College Student; E-mail; Education; Female; Global Health; Health Survey; Human; Human Experiment; Informed Consent; Japan; Learning; Male; Postgraduate Student; Questionnaire; Research Student; Software; Teaching; Tropical Medicine; Undergraduate Student; Student; University; Checklist; Humans; Learning; Students; Surveys And Questionnaires; Teaching; Universities,adult; article; checklist; clinical article; college student; e-mail; education; female; global health; health survey; human; human experiment; informed consent; Japan; learning; male; postgraduate student; questionnaire; research student; software; teaching; tropical medicine; undergraduate student; student; university; Checklist; Humans; Learning; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Teaching; Universities,,,The authors would like to thank the participants for undertaking this survey that can improve the education of future cohorts.,"Checklist Manifesto how to Get Things Right, (2009); Improving Achievement and Student Satisfaction Through Criteria Based Evaluation Checklists and Rubrics in Educational Research Courses, (1999); Nicole Lauzon Via Ldaoeng Checklists and Achievement Charts, (2014); Salinitri, Francine D., Reliability and validity of a checklist to evaluate student performance in a problem-based learning group, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 83, 8, pp. 1712-1722, (2019); Goodman, Daisy J., Feasibility and Acceptability of a Checklist and Learning Collaborative to Promote Quality and Safety in the Perinatal Care of Women with Opioid Use Disorders, Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health, 64, 1, pp. 104-111, (2019); Davis, Ronald L., The Biology of Forgetting—A Perspective, Neuron, 95, 3, pp. 490-503, (2017); Ponds, Rudolf W.H.M., Prevalence and covariates of subjective forgetfulness in a normal population in the Netherlands, International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 45, 3, pp. 207-221, (1997); Sharma, Akash, A Consensus-Based Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS), Journal of General Internal Medicine, 36, 10, pp. 3179-3187, (2021); Hoffman, Kelly Marie, Racial bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations, and false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113, 16, pp. 4296-4301, (2016); Meinema, Jennita G., Intervention Descriptions in Medical Education: What Can Be Improved?

It reviews the idea of “nature” in Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Tagalog, Cebuano, Lumad, Indonesian, Burmese, Nepali, Khmer, and Mongolian. It shows that the conceptual subtleties in the conceptualization of nature often hide wider and deeper cosmological mismatches. It concludes by suggesting that these diverse voices need to be represented in global reports on sustainability, which can be fostered by the direct involvement of experts from diverse traditions of thought who have access and interpretative knowledge of sources in languages other than English. To take into consideration the diversity of conceptualizations of nature can lead to better decisions about sustainability and improve the acceptability and efficiency of environmental policies in each local context, as well as internationally. Solutions and policies on the ground must be designed based on the local conceptual and cultural frames. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,"Funding text 1: The authors Sr. Amaro Joaquim de Ara\u00FAjo (Seu Ba\u00FA) received support during collection; the Coordena\u00E7\u00E3o de Aperfei\u00E7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00EDvel Superior\u2014CAPES and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00EDfico e Tecnol\u00F3gico (CNPq) gave financial support.; Funding text 2: We are grateful to Prof. Tran Van Quyen from Thang Long University for his help on the link between the Vietnamese concepts of nature and Ancient Chinese, and to Antonious Aditantyo for his help with the Indonesian contribution.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on data collected from 144 Vietnamese enterprises, this study employs partial least squares path modeling to analyze the direct and indirect relationships among external integration, information integration, process integration and economic performance. Findings: Analytical results indicate that of the three SCI practices, external integration has a significant and positive impact on economic performance. Process integration and information integration, on the one hand, reveal insignificant direct impact on economic performance, and on the other, show significant indirect effect on economic performance through external integration. Originality/value: This study sheds new light on the contribution of SCI to economic performance in developing economies and offers suggestions for not only local management but also foreign investors on the efficient allocation of resources to achieve higher economic performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Developing Country; Economic Performance; Empirical Study; Supply Chain Integration,,,,"The authors are grateful to the Editor, Associate Editor, and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and helpful suggestions.

Here we convened, as part of this Delphi study, a diverse, multidisciplinary panel of 386 academic, health, non-governmental organization, government and other experts in COVID-19 response from 112 countries and territories to recommend specific actions to end this persistent global threat to public health. The panel developed a set of 41 consensus statements and 57 recommendations to governments, health systems, industry and other key stakeholders across six domains: communication; health systems; vaccination; prevention; treatment and care; and inequities. In the wake of nearly three years of fragmented global and national responses, it is instructive to note that three of the highest-ranked recommendations call for the adoption of whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches1, while maintaining proven prevention measures using a vaccines-plus approach2 that employs a range of public health and financial support measures to complement vaccination. Other recommendations with at least 99% combined agreement advise governments and other stakeholders to improve communication, rebuild public trust and engage communities3 in the management of pandemic responses. The findings of the study, which have been further endorsed by 184 organizations globally, include points of unanimous agreement, as well as six recommendations with >5% disagreement, that provide health and social policy actions to address inadequacies in the pandemic response and help to bring this public health threat to an end. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Sars-cov-2 Vaccine; Covid-19; Government; Public Health; Social Policy; Article; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Delphi Study; Female; Financial Management; Health Care System; Human; Infection Prevention; Interpersonal Communication; Male; Pandemic; Policy; Stakeholder Engagement; Threat; Trust; Vaccination; Vaccine Hesitancy; Prevention And Control; Delphi Technique; Government; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; COVID-19; government; public health; social policy; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; Delphi study; female; financial management; health care system; human; infection prevention; interpersonal communication; male; pandemic; policy; stakeholder engagement; threat; trust; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; prevention and control; Delphi Technique; Government; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health,,,"Funding text 1: J.V.L. reports research grants to his institution from AbbVie, Gilead Sciences and MSD, and speaker fees from AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, Intercept, Janssen, MSD and ViiV, and an advisory board fee from AbbVie and Novavax, all unrelated to this work.

Butterflies are a conspicuous and ubiquitous component of urban nature across megacities that are highly urbanized with little opportunity for human-nature interactions. We evaluated public familiarity with, perceptions of and attitudes toward butterflies across nine megacities in East and Southeast Asia through face-to-face interviews with 1774 urban park users. A total of 79% of respondents had seen butterflies in their cities mostly in urban parks, indicating widespread familiarity with butterflies. Those who had seen butterflies also had higher perceptions of butterflies, whereas greater than 50% of respondents had positive attitudes toward butterflies. Frequent visits to natural places in urban neighbourhoods was associated with (i) sightings of caterpillars, indicating increased familiarity with urban wildlife, and (ii) increased connectedness to nature. We found two significant positive relationships: (i) between connectedness to nature and attitudes toward butterflies and (ii) between connectedness to nature and perceptions of butterflies, firmly linking parks users' thoughts and feelings about butterflies with their view of nature. This suggests that butterflies in urban parks can play a key role in building connectedness to nature and consequently pro-environmental behaviours and support for wildlife conservation among urban residents. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Butterflies; Conservation; Human-wildlife Interactions; Megacities; Nature Experiences; Urban Wildlife,,,,"Funding text 1: The authors thank Naresuan University, Kunming Institute of Zoology and the International Botanical Congress held in Shenzhen in 2017 for supporting this work.

Estimation results show strong evidence of the nonlinear relationship between the two variables. The influence of entrepreneurship density on natural resource rents is subject to two different regimes. In low- and upper-middle-income countries, an increase in entrepreneurship density increases natural resource rents to a certain level, but it reduces the rents afterwards. In high-income countries, the relationship is reversed.

Since MSMEs are diverse, however, the severity of the pandemic's impact on them varies considerably depending on their characteristics. Using online survey data of MSMEs from eight developing economies in South, Southeast, and Northeast Asia, this paper attempts to deepen our understanding of the impact of the pandemic on MSMEs, especially their employment, sales revenue, and cash flow. It also characterizes those firms that began participating in online commerce and tries to determine how their use of online commerce and their employment are related in this difficult time. This paper also examines the government support that MSMEs have received and the extent to which it has satisfied their support needs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash Shortage; Covid-19; Digitalization; Employment; Micro, Small And Medium Enterprises (msmes); Sales",,,,"We are grateful to Daisuke Miyakawa for his helpful comments.

Data for analysis were obtained from direct interviews with households in Quang Dien and Phong Dien coastal plain districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed to gain insight into factors driving household rehabilitation. The findings accentuated improvements in women's post-flood resilience as a result of effective interventions from communities, authorities and NGOs. Diversifying livelihoods into the non-agricultural sector was also an important factor to shorten the rehabilitation processes. Additionally, the results emphasized the efficacy of social interactions, notably between relatives and informal groups, after floods. The potential negative consequences of reliance on government support in household rehabilitation efforts are also preliminarily discussed.

This requires that teacher education institutes reorient and redefine their outcome standards as well as redesign their training programs accordingly to incorporate and implement Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Although many efforts have been made to promote ESD in teacher training, little information is available regarding to what extent ESD is integrated in teacher training programs or curricula. This study examines how ESD is incorporated in teacher training programs in terms of learning content, learning outcomes and didactic approach, through analyzing 429 course syllabi offered by the Hanoi National University of Education (HNUE) in Vietnam. HNUE training programs were found to contain some elements of ESD but they lack coherence or systematic inclusion. The results suggest needed strategic changes at organizational (university) and individual (instructor) levels to improve ESD in teacher education. This paper contributes to the discussion on the implementation of a holistic curricular assessment approach for three aspects of ESD (learning content, learning outcomes and didactic approach) and highlights the ongoing need for improving curricular assessment strategies for sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Curriculum Assessment; Education For Sustainable Development (esd); Higher Education; Teacher Education; Curricula; Electrostatic Devices; Personnel Training; Planning; Teaching; Curriculum Assessment; Education For Sustainable Development; High Educations; Learning Contents; Learning Outcome; Teacher Education; Teacher Training; Teachers Training Programs; Training Program; Sustainable Development,Curricula; Electrostatic devices; Personnel training; Planning; Teaching; Curriculum assessment; Education for sustainable development; High educations; Learning contents; Learning outcome; Teacher education; Teacher training; Teachers training programs; Training program; Sustainable development,,,This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 503.01-2020.302 .,"Albareda-Tiana, Sílvia, Implementing the sustainable development goals at University level, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 19, 3, pp. 473-497, (2018); Albareda-Tiana, Sílvia, Holistic approaches to develop sustainability and research competencies in pre-service teacher training, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 10, (2018); Implementing Sustainability in Higher Education Learning in an Age of Transformation, (2015); Barth, Matthias, Academic staff development as a catalyst for curriculum change towards education for sustainable development: An output perspective, Journal of Cleaner Production, 26, pp. 28-36, (2012); Barth, Matthias, Synthesising case-study research - ready for the next step?, Environmental Education Research, 18, 6, pp. 751-764, (2012); Comp A J Comp Int Educ, (2021); Boyd, Peter J., Becoming a university lecturer in teacher education: Expert school teachers reconstructing their pedagogy and identity, Professional Development in Education, 36, 1-2, pp. 9-24, (2010); Brandt, Jan Ole, Becoming a competent teacher in education for sustainable development: Learning outcomes and processes in teacher education, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 20, 4, pp. 630-653, (2019); Brundiers, Katja, Key competencies in sustainability in higher education—toward an agreed-upon reference framework, Sustainability Science, 16, 1, pp. 13-29, (2021); Bürgener, Lina, Sustainability competencies in teacher education: Making teacher education count in everyday school practice, Journal of Cleaner Production, 174, pp. 821-826, (2018)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,09596526,,JCROE,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132532259,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the feedback of 313 manufacturing enterprises in four sectors (electronics, agriculture, food, textiles) operating in Vietnam, this study found some important findings. Firstly, GSCM has a positive and significant influence on the operational performance of businesses in Vietnam. Secondly, the resulting effect of implementing GSCM is better for enterprises with large scale and high export rates. This has reaffirmed the need to improve the overall supply chain management and green supply chain of this group of businesses. Overall, the findings suggest that improving GSCM practices is important not only for businesses in developed countries but also for businesses in emerging economic regions such as Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Green Supply Chain Management; Operational Performance; Vietnam,,,,,"Ahi, Payman, A comparative literature analysis of definitions for green and sustainable supply chain management, Journal of Cleaner Production, 52, pp. 329-341, (2013); Aras, Güler, Managing corporate performance: Investigating the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in emerging markets, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 59, 3, pp. 229-254, (2010); Ramesh Babu, Balakrishnan, Electrical and electronic waste: A global environmental problem, Waste Management and Research, 25, 4, pp. 307-318, (2007); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Beamon, Benita M., Environmental and sustainability ethics in supply chain management, Science and Engineering Ethics, 11, 2, pp. 221-234, (2005); Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, (2018); Chan, Ricky Y.K., Corporate environmentalism pursuit by foreign firms competing in China, Journal of World Business, 45, 1, pp. 80-92, (2010); Chan, Ricky Y.K., Environmental orientation and corporate performance: The mediation mechanism of green supply chain management and moderating effect of competitive intensity, Industrial Marketing Management, 41, 4, pp. 621-630, (2012); Modern Methods for Business Research, (1998); Choi, Donghyun, The impact of green supply chain management practices on firm performance: the role of collaborative capability, Operations Management Research, 8, 3-4, pp. 69-83, (2015)",,Growing Science,,,,,,22916822; 22916830,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137367786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: A meta-analytic investigation of 32 studies was conducted to check hypotheses. Both uncorrected sample-size-weighted and corrected sample-size-weighted mean correlation coefficients were calculated. Meta-regression was used to assess moderation from EI and narcissism measures. Findings: The results indicated that the relationship between EI and narcissism varied, depending on how EI and narcissism were constructed and measured. Specifically, EI was positively related to grandiose narcissism (GN) and negatively related to vulnerable narcissism (VN). EI was also positively correlated with “composite measures” of narcissism when the measures focused on GN, and negatively correlated when the measures focused on VN. Furthermore, some EI and narcissism measures moderated the correlation between EI and narcissism. Originality/value: The current study enriches theory by synthesizing the literature to examine whether, and under which conditions, EI fosters or inhibits narcissism. By using the self-regulatory process of narcissism, carefully considering the multifaceted nature of narcissism and updating more data in the meta-analysis, this study contributes to explaining the inconsistency in the relationship between EI and narcissism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Emotional Intelligence; Grandiose Narcissism; Meta-analysis; Narcissism; Organizational Behavior; Self-regulatory Process; Vulnerable Narcissism,,,,Funding: The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research of this article: This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.02-2020.05.,"Ames, Daniel R., The NPI-16 as a short measure of narcissism, Journal of Research in Personality, 40, 4, pp. 440-450, (2006); Austin, Elizabeth J., Associations of the managing the emotions of others (MEOS) scale with personality, the Dark Triad and trait EI, Personality and Individual Differences, 65, pp. 8-13, (2014); Multi Health Systems, (1997); Begg, Colin B., Operating characteristics of a rank correlation test for publication bias, Biometrics, 50, 4, pp. 1088-1101, (1994); Brown, Ashley A., Perceived agency mediates the link between the narcissistic subtypes and self-esteem, Personality and Individual Differences, 90, pp. 124-129, (2016); Cǒté, Stéphane, Emotional Intelligence in Organizations, Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 1, pp. 459-488, (2014); Cragun, Ormonde Rhees, Making CEO Narcissism Research Great: A Review and Meta-Analysis of CEO Narcissism, Journal of Management, 46, 6, pp. 908-936, (2020); Derry, Kate Loren, Fearing Failure: Grandiose Narcissism, Vulnerable Narcissism, and Emotional Reactivity in Children, Child Development, 91, 3, pp. e581-e596, (2020); Duval, Sue J., Trim and fill: A simple funnel-plot-based method of testing and adjusting for publication bias in meta-analysis, Biometrics, 56, 2, pp. 455-463, (2000); Egger, Matthias, Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test, BMJ, 315, 7109, pp. 629-634, (1997)",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,,,,,20408269,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125046540,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, this study further reveals the diverse nature of university lecturers with regards to their tendencies to adopt active teaching methods using the segmentation technique of marketing. Design/methodology/approach: A structured survey was implemented with university lecturers in Hanoi (Vietnam), obtaining a sample of 218 respondents from six universities. Descriptive analysis was carried out to identify the extent of the adoption of these methods. In addition, cluster analysis and analysis of variance were computed to extract and define the segments of university lecturers. Findings: The findings show that the lecturers, on average, had a tendency to apply active teaching methods. However, the extent of the application of these methods differed among four clusters: “conservatives,” “liberals,” “junior conservatives” and “junior liberals.” In addition, it was found that the degree to which active methods were applied may have been affected by the lecturers' trust in and their empowerment of the students. The application of active methods may also have been influenced by various covert characteristics of the lecturers, including thinking styles (cognition-based) and emotional intelligence (affect-based). The lecturers' overt characteristics, such as age, education and experience, may also have affected their application of active methods, while biological sex seems not to have been a significant factor. Originality/value: The results of this study expand the literature by explaining the diversity of university lecturers from the perspective of the active teaching and learning methods. They also provide implications for the management of education reform based on the varied implementation of the said methods that has already taken place. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Active Methods; Affect-based Criteria; Cognition-based Criteria; Lecturer Segmentation; Vietnam's University,,,,,"Admiraal, Wilfried F., Teachers in school-based technology innovations: A typology of their beliefs on teaching and technology, Computers and Education, 114, pp. 57-68, (2017); Angulo, Fernando, A market segmentation approach for higher education based on rational and emotional factors, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 20, 1, pp. 1-17, (2010); Bandura, Albert, Perceived Self-Efficacy in Cognitive Development and Functioning, Educational Psychologist, 28, 2, pp. 117-148, (1993); Baumann, Chris, The role of culture, competitiveness and economic performance in explaining academic performance: A global market analysis for international student segmentation, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 21, 2, pp. 181-201, (2011); Boyatzis, Richard E., From learning styles to learning skills: The executive skills profile, Journal of Managerial Psychology, 10, 5, pp. 3-17, (1995); Business Research Methods and Statistics Using Spss, (2008); Carless, David Robert, Factors in the implementation of task-based teaching in primary schools, System, 31, 4, pp. 485-500, (2003); Cheng, Yin Cheong, Education reform phenomenon: A typology of multiple dilemmas, pp. 85-109, (2020); Constantinides, Efthymios, Potential of the social media as instruments of higher education marketing: A segmentation study, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 21, 1, pp. 7-24, (2011); Cook-Sather, Alison, Authorizing Students' Perspectives: Toward Trust, Dialogue, and Change in Education, Educational Researcher, 31, 4, pp. 3-14, (2002)",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,,,,,2515964X,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136926013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire surveys were conducted to collect the opinions of 212 household representatives living in Hanoi City. The survey tools were tested and adjusted through an online survey with 191 responses. Multivariate probit and linear regression models were used to identify determinants of respondents’ choices of measures and their WTP. Findings: Respondents expressed their strong preferences for three measures for air quality improvements, including: (1) increase of green spaces; (2) use of less polluting fuels; (3) expansion of public transportation. The mean WTP for the implementation of those measures was estimated at about 148,000–282,000 Vietnamese dong, equivalent to 0.09–0.16% of household income. The respondents’ choices appear to be consistent with their characteristics and needs, such as financial affordability, time on roads and their perceived impacts of air pollution. The WTP estimates increase with perception of air pollution impacts, time on roads, education and income; but are lower for older people. Practical implication: Increase of green spaces can be the measure to which policy makers should pay more attention. The match-up of residents needs and well-informed plans will be an important key to success. Originality/value: This appears to be the first attempt to test the validity of public opinions on choices of measures for improving urban air quality in Vietnam.

In addition, the positive effect of CSR practices on social sustainability performance (SSP) is examined. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of hypotheses between barriers, CSR practices and SSP is established. Using a survey questionnaire, empirical data are collected from 17 construction firms in Vietnam. PLS-SEM is used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that organizational and industrial barriers negatively affect CSR practices. This study also finds that education and training and government support could enable construction firms to reduce the impact of such barriers. Research limitations/implications: The data are collected in Vietnam; thereby the findings are only applicable in developing countries. Further research should also be conducted in other countries to improve the generalizability of the theoretical framework. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that construction firms could apply several strategies (e.g. providing their employees with CSR training and education; embedding CSR into their firm policy, mission and vision) to mitigate the impact of CSR barriers and, accordingly, ensure the success of adopting CSR practices.

Using a panel data set of more than 1000 Japanese listed firms from 2005 to 2014, we focus on firms that introduced female directors to their male-dominant boards for the first time and find that the first-introduced female directors are positively associated with a greater number of female officers and managers. The introduction of the first female director is also associated with better CSR performance. Our results are statistically significant and suggest that board gender diversity has an effect on promoting gender diversity at lower levels and CSR performance in listed firms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Board Gender Diversity; Corporate Governance; Csr; Female Directors; Japan,,,,"Funding text 1: We would like to thank Yoko Shirasu, Mahnoor Sattar, and seminar participants at the 44th Conference of the Japan Finance Association, the 32nd Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics Annual Conference, and the 8th Annual International Conference on Emerging Challenges: Contemporary Issues in Innovation and Management, 2021 New Zealand Finance Meeting for their helpful suggestions and comments.

Our findings also demonstrate the advantage but also the inherent limitation of traditional theories such as Davis's “Technological Acceptance Model” in accounting for of cross-cultural factors such as religions and regions, given the transfer of new technologies across borders.

Past research has placed a focus on the combination of this method and narrow reading, or the use of this method in teaching languages other than English. This study explored narrow listening as an independent method to improve EFL learners’ listening comprehension. The 38 participants in this study were intermediate EFL adult learners following a general English course. During the experiment, the treatment group were provided with narrow listening materials, while the control group were given listening exercises as homework. A pre-test and a post-test were used to measure the participants’ listening comprehension. The results indicated that the treatment group outperformed the control group on the post-test. Compared to their control group counterparts, the narrow listening learners gained significantly greater comprehension of the oral texts, even those about the topics they had not practiced during the treatment. The findings have suggested that narrow listening has a positive impact on EFL learners’ listening competence and that repetition in listening is advantageous to language acquisition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Efl Listening; Input Repetition; Listening Comprehension; Listening Skills; Narrow Listening,,,,,"Theoretical Models and Processes of Reading, (1994); Listening, (1988); British Journal of Education, (2015); Memoirs of the Osaka Institute of Technology, (2007); Boyle, Joseph P., Sex Differences in Listening Vocabulary, Language Learning, 37, 2, pp. 273-284, (1987); Teaching Listening, (2006); Assessing Listening, (2001); International Journal of Foreign Language Teaching Ijelt, (2005); Tlemc Teaching and Learning English in Multicultural Contexts, (2017); Chang, Anna Ching Shyang, EFFECTS of NARROW READING and LISTENING on L2 VOCABULARY LEARNING, Studies in Second Language Acquisition, 41, 4, pp. 769-794, (2019)",,Chulalongkorn University Language Institute,,,,,,22870024; 01252488,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148293562,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV service access and delivery in the Asia region. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional, online study, conducted between October-November 2020, assessed the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and care among people living with HIV (PLHIV), key populations (KPs), and healthcare providers (HCPs). The study populations were recruited across ten Asian countries/territories, covering Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Results Across the region, 702 PLHIV, 551 KPs, and 145 HCPs were recruited. Both PLHIV and KPs reported decreased or had yet to visit hospitals/clinics (PLHIV: 35.9%; KPs: 57.5%), reduced HIV RNA viral load testing (21.9%; 47.3%), and interruptions in antiretroviral therapy (ART) (22.3%) or decreased/complete stop of HIV prevention medication consumption (40.9%). Travel constraints (40.6%), financial issues (28.9%), and not receiving prescription refills (26.9%) were common reasons for interrupted ART access, whereas reduced engagements in behaviours that could increase the risks of HIV acquisition and transmission (57.7%), travel constraints (41.8%), and less hospital/clinic visits (36.7%) underlie the disruptions in HIV preventive medications. Decreased visits from PLHIV/KPs and rescheduled appointments due to clinic closure were respectively reported by 50.7%-52.1% and 15.6%-17.0% of HCPs; 43.6%-61.9% observed decreased ART/preventive medication refills. Although 85.0% of HCPs adopted telemedicine to deliver HIV care services, 56.4%- 64.1% of PLHIV/KPs were not using telehealth services. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic substantially disrupted HIV prevention to care continuum in Asia at the time of the study. The findings highlighted differences in HIV prevention to care continuum via telehealth services utilisation by PLHIV, KPs, and HCPs. Efforts are needed to optimise infrastructure and adapt systems for continued HIV care with minimal disruptions during health emergency crises. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Virus Rna; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy; Article; Asia; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Drug Use; Female; Financial Stress; Geographic Distribution; Health Behavior; Health Care Access; Health Care Delivery; Health Care Personnel; Health Care Utilization; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Major Clinical Study; Male; Public Health; Telemedicine; Travel; Treatment Interruption; Virus Load; Virus Transmission; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; Hong Kong; Pandemic; Patient Care; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Continuity Of Patient Care; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Health Personnel; Hiv Infections; Humans; Pandemics,virus RNA; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Asia; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; drug use; female; financial stress; geographic distribution; health behavior; health care access; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; public health; telemedicine; travel; treatment interruption; virus load; virus transmission; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Hong Kong; pandemic; patient care; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Continuity of Patient Care; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Personnel; HIV Infections; Humans; Pandemics,,,,"Competing Health Risks Associated with the Covid 19 Pandemic and Response A Scoping Review Medrxiv, (2021); WHO Releases Guidelines to Help Countries Maintain Essential Health Services During the Covid 19 Pandemic; Ji, Yunpeng, Potential association between COVID-19 mortality and health-care resource availability, The Lancet Global Health, 8, 4, (2020); Understanding the HIV Care Continuum, (2019); Fujita, Masami, A new analytical framework of 'continuum of prevention and care' to maximize HIV case detection and retention in care in Vietnam, BMC Health Services Research, 12, 1, (2012); HIV AIDS, (2025); Covid 19 and HIV, (2020); Inews Co Uk, (2020); Sun, Yinghui, Antiretroviral treatment interruption among people living with HIV during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a nationwide cross-sectional study, Journal of the International AIDS Society, 23, 11, (2020); Kowalska, Justyna Dominika, HIV care in times of the COVID-19 crisis — Where are we now in Central and Eastern Europe?, International Journal of Infectious Diseases, 96, pp. 311-314, (2020)",,Public Library of Science,,,,,,19326203,,POLNC,35857755,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134580527,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the capital of Vietnam, Hanoi, the municipal government is facing a number of difficulties in providing sufficient water in a sustainable manner due to the increasing urban population and the serious pollution of both surface and groundwater resources, but this is also due to a lack of resources to invest in the supply system. This study aimed to investigate water users’ willingness to pay for the improvement of Hanoi’s domestic water supply system. A contingent valuation process based on a survey of 402 respondents was used to explore citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the improvement of their urban water supply. The results show that Hanoi’s urban communities (more than 90%) were generally satisfied with the quantity of their water supply, but tended to be dissatisfied with its quality, with 80% of the respondents using advanced water purifiers before drinking and cooking.

This led to a rapid increase in solid waste generation,leading to problems and challenges in solid waste collection and management. This problem is alsobeing experienced by other developing countries of the world. Despite the existence of establishedwaste management strategies, targets set for the collection of recyclable waste have not been met.This study introduces solutions to the problems and challenges faced by the waste managementsector in Hoi An city and other developing countries. This study aimed to i) optimize the map of therecovery recycling stations in an urban community, ii) develop an effective solid waste collectionsystem, and iii) provide management tools to enhance recycling activities, contributing to improvingwaste management in Hoi An city.METHODS: The RRSs were integrated into a solid waste collection system in the urban communitiesof Hoi An City, were conducted through location-allocation analysis in a geographic informationsystem environment. Routing problems of carts were solved in the combination of the reschedulingof existing solid waste collection activities in the study site. The economic evaluation by scenarioswas also calculated for ten years to assess the feasibility of scenarios.FINDINGS: Thirty-four locations were identified and optimized to accommodate the RRSs and newcollection routes. The distances travelled and working time increased in proportion to the increasein waste separation effectiveness. Waste separation is vital to the effectiveness of the new solidwaste collection system. The optimal solid waste practice model (in scenarios 2 and 4) revealedthe positive results in improving the solid waste collection system, operating economy, and localadaptation.CONCLUSION: This study redesigned the solid waste collection system to solve the current problemsin the tourism destination of Hoi An city. This study contributed as a case study of integrating urbanrecovery recycling stations into optimizing a solid waste collection system in a tourism destination.Introducing strict waste separation was the pivotal first step in systematically upgrading the solidwaste collection system in Hoi An City.

Methods: Interviews with five diabetic patients were conducted at a tertiary general hospital located in southern Vietnam. The transcribed data were first subjected to quantitative text analysis using KH Coder to identify major categories of frequently used words, followed by a qualitative analysis of selected cases using the Steps for Coding and Theorization (SCAT) method. Results: The major categories of frequently used words were chronic health conditions, services, facilities, insurance, patient-doctor communication, and medication. SCAT analysis of three selected cases identified six themes: “Disregarding the disease at the early stage,” “Fear of complications,” “Satisfaction with hospital services and medical staff,” “Insurance-related problems,” “Long waiting times,” and “Communication barriers between patients and doctors.” Patients were satisfied with improved hospital facilities and services; however, the overloading of one hospital led to long waiting times and communication difficulties with doctors. Difficulties with health insurance were also observed, and patients were rather passive in disease management and needed to be empowered through improved communication with doctors and other care providers. Conclusion: These findings from our trial of introducing a qualitative study into service evaluation suggest that listening to patients can help health providers learn their perspectives and be more responsive to their needs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Diabetes; Qualitative Study; Quality Of Care; Quality Of Life; Vietnam,,,,"This project was supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency Partnership Program Promoting Evidence-based Patient-centered Health Services in Southern Vietnam: University and Medical Association Partnership Initiative (PI: AG) and in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 20K10539) (Co-PI: AG, PI: Hirohide Yokokawa at Juntendo University).","Binh, Tran Quang, Knowledge and Associated Factors Towards Type 2 Diabetes Among a Rural Population in the Red River Delta Region, Vietnam, Rural and Remote Health, 15, 3, pp. 1-12, (2015); Burge, Peter, Do patients always prefer quicker treatment?

This study attempted to shed light on these paradoxes by understanding the business collaboration between the host community and travel agencies through two case studies in central Vietnam. Data were obtained through empirical surveys conducted in 2018. The data were then analyzed by applying the three-stage framework of the CBT development process. These results highlight two implicit paradoxes that lead to dilemmatic scenarios during CBT development. First, the results heavily emphasize the role of the private sector in supporting tourism growth, yet excessive control leads to elite capture, wage gaps, unfair competition, and issues of non-authenticity. Second, tourism companies seek to transform the community’s resources into unique tourism values; unfortunately, these values do not include villagers’ trust, norms, and identity. Ultimately, this causes villagers to react negatively to these enterprises. Although examples of backlash unintentionally harmed tourism success, collective action and the persistence of traditional norms enabled host communities to maintain their value of honesty, customs, and beliefs against being too dependent on outside groups. Recognizing these issues, this study proposes tourism-related policy implications to avoid such situations, mitigate risks, and maximize the benefits for local community groups. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Central Vietnam; Community-based Tourism; Ethnic Minority; Paradoxes; Three-stage Framework,,,,"Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for their scholarship to support this work.

This paper investigates the effects of NTMs on Vietnamese exports. It considers NTMs imposed by importing countries and by the Vietnamese government itself. We find that for importing countries' NTMs the technical measures have a positive effect on Vietnamese exports, especially intermediate goods. Final products seem to be the target of non-technical measures used by importing countries. With regard to Vietnam's export-related NTMs, technical measures seem to be effective in increasing Vietnam's exports of final products to importing countries with a level of per capita income below US$11,462. For those importing country markets, the positive marginal effect of Vietnam's export-related technical measures on exports of final products is higher in poorer countries. On the other hand, the non-technical categories tend to negatively affect Vietnamese exports of intermediate goods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,"We thank Kiyotaka Sato, Nagendra Shrestha, Minako Fujio, and Teru Nishikawa for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this work.

Thus, a further understanding of consumer behaviour and loyalty towards such food is essential for food retailers. This study aims at exploring segments of consumer loyalty and its influential factors towards safe food brands in the country. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 250 consumers buying safe food in Hanoi city in February 2019, two-step cluster and multinomial logistic regression analyses were applied. Findings: The results show that four segments of brand loyalty were formed from the interaction between attitudinal and behavioural loyalty as the framework of Dick and Basu (1994), namely, true loyalty, spurious loyalty, latent loyalty and disloyalty. Notably, over 60% of the consumers were in latent loyalty and spurious loyalty, indicating variety-seeking behaviour, multi-brand loyalty or low recognition of the brand. Consumer satisfaction was the most vital motivating consumers to higher loyalty levels. Additionally, brand trust and brand familiarity played significant roles in developing true brand loyalty. An attractive selling store and friendly staff were also important in enhancing brand loyalty. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to elicit consumer loyalty and identify factors driving the loyalty towards brands of safe food in a developing country like Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brand Loyalty; Brands; Consumer Loyalty; Safe Food; Safe Vegetables; Vietnam,,,,"This study was partially funded by the QR programme, Kyushu University, Japan.

Our study aimed to identify important predictors of this set of behaviors. Whereas social and health psychological theories suggest a limited set of predictors, machine-learning analyses can identify correlates from a larger pool of candidate predictors. We used random forests to rank 115 candidate correlates of infection-prevention behavior in 56,072 participants across 28 countries, administered in March to May 2020. The machine-learning model predicted 52% of the variance in infection-prevention behavior in a separate test sample—exceeding the performance of psychological models of health behavior. Results indicated the two most important predictors related to individual-level injunctive norms. Illustrating how data-driven methods can complement theory, some of the most important predictors were not derived from theories of health behavior—and some theoretically derived predictors were relatively unimportant. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Dsml2: Proof-of-concept: Data Science Output Has Been Formulated, Implemented, And Tested For One Domain/problem; Health Behaviors; Machine Learning; Public Goods Dilemma; Random Forest; Social Norms; Decision Trees; Machine Learning; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Coronaviruses; Domain Problems; Dsml2: Proof-of-concept: Data Science Output Have Been Formulated, Implemented, And Tested For One Domain/problem; Health Behaviors; Proof Of Concept; Public Good Dilemma; Public Goods; Random Forests; Social Norm; Coronavirus","Decision trees; Machine learning; Coronavirus disease 2019; Coronaviruses; Domain problems; DSML2: proof-of-concept: data science output have been formulated, implemented, and tested for one domain/problem; Health behaviors; Proof of concept; Public good dilemma; Public goods; Random forests; Social norm; Coronavirus",,,"The lead author was funded by a NWO Veni Grant (NWO Grant Number VI.Veni.191G.090 ).

We used a legal doctrine method to review the updated Vietnamese legal frameworks, consisting of substantive, procedural, and preventive cybercrime law. We then combined the analysis of four cybercrime cases and in-depth interviews of seven senior police officials to analyse the application of cybercrime law. The main findings reveal that by updating its legal system, Vietnam has shown a determination to prevent and disrupt cybercrime. Despite positive results, Vietnam’s fight against cybercrime still faces legal challenges, including traditional and novel ones. Moreover, active and flexible approaches within Vietnam’s cyberspace management can increase the effectiveness of combating cybercriminal activities; however, they can cause concerns in balancing cybercrime control and human rights protection. These approaches could then constitute a useful case study for other similar situations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,We would like to thank Prof. Ken Miichi (Waseda University) for his advice and his comments on earlier versions of the article.,"World Internet Usage and Population Statistics, (2012); E Conomy Sea 2018, (2018); Economic Impact of Cybercrime, (2018); van Nguyen, Trong, Cybercrime in Vietnam: An analysis based on routine activity theory, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 14, 1, pp. 156-173, (2020); Bao Cao Tong Ket Nam 2010, (2010); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2014); van Nguyen, Trong, The structure of cybercrime networks: transnational computer fraud in Vietnam, Journal of Crime and Justice, 44, 4, pp. 419-440, (2021); van Nguyen, Trong, The modus operandi of transnational computer fraud: a crime script analysis in Vietnam, Trends in Organized Crime, 25, 2, pp. 226-247, (2022); Great Cyber Game in South China Sea, (2016)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,,,,,15730751; 09254994,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114691103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to identify the challenges faced by hotel managers in adopting MTs in their industry, such that the authors may determine the strategic positions for adopting and managing MTs and build a frame of reference for hotel management practices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a series of focus group interviews (FGIs) with the managers and executives of luxury hotels. FGIs were conducted in groups in a semi-structured format, asking questions about MT adoption in their hotels and the challenges they faced. The FGI transcripts were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Findings: Open and axial coding of FGI scripts revealed 15 underlying categories of challenges in adopting MTs in hotels. Subsequent selective coding revealed two underlying dimensions: viability-fit. With these two underlying dimensions, a strategic model for MT adoption is developed. This model identifies four MT adoption strategies in hotels: lookers, experimenters, explorers and leaders. Originality/value: The model developed and presented herein may help analyze a hotel’s strategic positioning in adopting MT’s.

Particularly, nursing students experience greater stress as their normal curriculum is interrupted and some of them face the risk of being infected as frontline workers. Nursing faculty members may face similar struggles, in addition to developing teaching materials for online learning. Thus, it is important to examine the faculty members' and students' views on their ability to adapt during the pandemic to obtain a holistic view of how learning and training has been affected. Design: The descriptive cross-sectional quantitative design was used. Settings: Data were collected from Southeast and East Asian Nursing Education and Research Network (SEANERN) affiliated nursing institutions from January 2021 to August 2021. Participants: A total of 1897 nursing students and 395 faculty members from SEANERN-affiliated nursing institutions in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam were recruited for this study. Methods: Quantitative surveys were used to explore the satisfaction levels in education modalities, confidence levels, psychosocial well-being, sense of coherence and stress levels of nursing students and faculty members during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Participants were mostly satisfied with the new education modalities, although most students felt that their education was compromised. Both groups showed positive levels of psychosocial well-being, despite scoring low to medium on the sense of coherence scale and experiencing great stress. The participants' sense of coherence was positively correlated with their psychosocial well-being and negatively correlated with stress levels. Conclusions: While the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted the lives of nursing students and faculty members, most of them had a healthy level of psychosocial well-being. Having a strong sense of coherence was associated with better psychosocial health and lower stress levels. As such, it may be helpful to develop interventions aimed at improving the sense of coherence of nursing students and staff to help them manage stressors better. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Education; Nursing Undergraduates; Pandemic; Salutogenesis; Sense Of Coherence; Cross-sectional Study; Epidemiology; Human; Nursing Education; Nursing Student; Pandemic; Psychology; Sense Of Coherence; University; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Education, Nursing; Faculty, Nursing; Humans; Pandemics; Sense Of Coherence; Students, Nursing; Universities","cross-sectional study; epidemiology; human; nursing education; nursing student; pandemic; psychology; sense of coherence; university; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing; Faculty, Nursing; Humans; Pandemics; Sense of Coherence; Students, Nursing; Universities",,,This research was funded by the South East and East Asian Nursing Education and Research Network and supported by the China Medical Board .,"Health Stress and Coping, (1979); Antonovsky, Aaron, The structure and properties of the sense of coherence scale, Social Science and Medicine, 36, 6, pp. 725-733, (1993); Aslan, Hakime, Nursing students' views on the COVID-19 pandemic and their percieved stress levels, Perspectives in Psychiatric Care, 57, 2, pp. 695-701, (2021); Cardeña, Etzel, Psychometric properties of the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ): A valid and reliable measure of acute stress, Journal of Traumatic Stress, 13, 4, pp. 719-734, (2000); Dewart, Georgia K., Nursing education in a pandemic: Academic challenges in response to COVID-19, Nurse Education Today, 92, (2020); Du, Shizheng, The knowledge, ability, and skills of primary health care providers in SEANERN countries: A multi-national cross-sectional study, BMC Health Services Research, 19, 1, (2019); Impact of Covid 19 on Education and on the Well Being of Teachers Parents and Students Challenges Related to Remote Online Learning and Opportunities for Advancing the Quality of Education, (2020); Efendi, Ferry, Nursing qualification and workforce for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community, Nursing Forum, 53, 2, pp. 197-203, (2018); Eriksson, Monica, Validity of Antonovsky's sense of coherence scale: A systematic review, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 59, 6, pp. 460-466, (2005); Eriksson, Monica, The level of sense of coherence among Swedish nursing staff, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 75, 11, pp. 2766-2772, (2019)",,Churchill Livingstone,,,,,,02606917; 15322793,,,35101809,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123587637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study is based on survey data from a group of international (non-Japanese) students in Japan and the theoretical foundation of fear appeal theory. The results, which are based on the panel data structure, show that individually, (1) the act of seeking out others to discuss risks in depth in the current pandemic context or (2) the observed adoption of advocated precautionary health behaviours is not necessarily a good indicator of mental management, but (3) the combined effect of (1) and (2) unexpectedly suggests a conciliatory effect on the fear of disasters. Moreover, this evidence-based finding (3) suggests that a reciprocal relationship exists between threat and efficacy in terms of mediating fear under the framework and theory of fear appeals, indirectly challenging the fear control response proposition of the extended parallel process model. Our empirical findings emphasize the role of risk discourse and information sharing combined with preventive health behaviours adopted within a community in the context of global health crises. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Covid-19; Extended Parallel Process Model; Fear Appeals Theory; Fear Of Disasters; Foreign Students In Japan; Risk Communication Networks,,,,,"Lewnard, Joseph A., Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in California and Washington: Prospective cohort study, BMJ, 369, 9, (2020); Covid 19 Strategy Update, (2020); Trevors, Gregory J., Correcting COVID-19 Misconceptions Requires Caution, Educational Researcher, 49, 7, pp. 538-542, (2020); Chen, Qiang, Unpacking the black box: How to promote citizen engagement through government social media during the COVID-19 crisis, Computers in Human Behavior, 110, (2020); Clark, Cory J., Predictors of COVID-19 voluntary compliance behaviors: An international investigation, Global Transitions, 2, pp. 76-82, (2020); Shaw, Rajib K., Governance, technology and citizen behavior in pandemic: Lessons from COVID-19 in East Asia, Progress in Disaster Science, 6, (2020); Reynolds, Barbara J., Crisis and emergency risk communication as an integrative model, Journal of Health Communication, 10, 1, pp. 43-55, (2005); Lee, Minjung, Psychological and behavioral responses in South Korea during the early stages of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 9, (2020); Communication Yearbook, (1995); Gómez, Oscar A., Lessons from international students’ reaction to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake: The case of the school of engineering at Tohoku University, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 4, 3, pp. 137-149, (2013)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,22124209,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123284189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using data from the Young Lives project for Vietnam, we examine the effects of exposure to historically abnormal rainfall among children in utero on the cognitive development of the same children from 5 to 15 years of age. Based on data on month and place of birth, we show that positive rainfall shocks are associated with better cognitive development in children up to 8 years of age. The effect is more pronounced when positive shocks occur in the early stage of gestation. However, such positive effects are not sustained: the impacts of positive rainfall shocks on cognition are completely absent at 10 and 15 years of age. We contribute to the literature by examining the importance of the timing and persistence of weather shocks during pregnancy on cognitive development by tracking the same children from in utero to school age. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Children Cognition; Early Life; Foetus Origin Hypothesis; Vietnam; Weather Shocks; Child Health; Cognition; Maternal Health; Precipitation Intensity; Weather Forecasting; Viet Nam,child health; cognition; maternal health; precipitation intensity; weather forecasting; Viet Nam,,,"Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank Tushar Bharati and Rashesh Shrestha for the insightful comments and the excellent suggestion of the literature.

H., Department of Psychology, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a global health crisis. Consequently, many countries have adopted restrictive measures that caused a substantial change in society. Within this framework, it is reasonable to suppose that a sentiment of societal discontent, defined as generalized concern about the precarious state of society, has arisen. Literature shows that collectively experienced situations can motivate people to help each other. Since societal discontent is conceptualized as a collective phenomenon, we argue that it could influence intention to help others, particularly those who suffer from coronavirus. Thus, in the present study, we aimed (a) to explore the relationship between societal discontent and intention to help at the individual level and (b) to investigate a possible moderating effect of societal discontent at the country level on this relationship. To fulfil our purposes, we used data collected in 42 countries (N = 61,734) from the PsyCorona Survey, a cross-national longitudinal study. Results of multilevel analysis showed that, when societal discontent is experienced by the entire community, individuals dissatisfied with society are more prone to help others. Testing the model with longitudinal data (N = 3,817) confirmed our results. Implications for those findings are discussed in relation to crisis management.

Inequalities have been greatly reduced in areas such as education or employment. Because inequalities lead to distress, this development has largely benefited women. One notable exception is the realm of parenting, which has remained rife with inequalities even in the most egalitarian countries. We hypothesized that experiencing inequality in parenting when one holds egalitarian values and raising a child in a country characterized by a high level of gender equality in other areas, increases mothers’ psychological distress in the specific area of parenting. Multilevel modeling analyses computed among 11,538 mothers from 40 countries confirmed this prediction: high egalitarian values at the individual level and high gender equality at the societal level are associated with higher burnout levels in mothers. The associations hold beyond differences in sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level and beyond economic disparities at the societal level. These findings show the importance of egalitarian values and gender equality and their paradoxical effect when inequalities are still present in specific areas as parenting. This study reveals the crucial need to act not only at the micro level but also at the macro level to promote gender equality in parenting and prevent parental burnout. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Culture; Egalitarian Values; Family Policies; Gender Equality Paradox; Parental Burnout,,,,,"Amato, Paul R., Continuity and change in marital quality between 1980 and 2000, Journal of Marriage and Family, 65, 1, pp. 1-22, (2003); Eryılmaz, Günce Sabah, Validation of the Turkish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 15-32, (2020); Bianchi, Suzanne M., Housework: Who did, does or will do it, and how much does it matter?, Social Forces, 91, 1, pp. 55-63, (2012); Brycz, Hanna, Cross-cultural differences in metacognitive self, Economics and Sociology, 8, 1, pp. 157-164, (2015); Theory of Fertility Decline, (1982); La Gobernabilidad En America Latina Balance Reciente Y Tendencias A Futuro, (2005); Egypt Statistics, (2021); Chen, Ying, Positive parenting improves multiple aspects of health and well-being in young adulthood, Nature Human Behaviour, 3, 7, pp. 684-691, (2019); Cheung, Gordon Wai Hung, Evaluating goodness-of-fit indexes for testing measurement invariance, Structural Equation Modeling, 9, 2, pp. 233-255, (2002); Coltrane, Scott E., Research on household labor: Modeling and measuring the social embeddedness of routine family work, Journal of Marriage and Family, 62, 4, pp. 1208-1233, (2000)",,SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,,,00220221; 15525422,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125801434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) Methods: Surveys were distributed to 578 participants in selected international companies in Turkey, Taiwan, Japan, and China. To reduce uncertainty and errors, the surveys were rigorously evaluated and did not show a normal distribution, as it was determined that 85 participants did not consciously fill out the questionnaires, and the questionnaires from the remaining 493 participants were used. By using the evaluation model of employee satisfaction based on a back propagation (BP) neural network, we explored the manifestation and impact of abusive management and self-efficacy. Using the listed real estate businesses as an example, we proposed a deep learning BP neural network-based employee job satisfaction evaluation model and a human–machine technology-based employee performance evaluation system under situational perception, according to the design requirements of human– machine interaction. (3) Results: The results show that the human–machine interface can log in according to the correct verbal instructions of the employees. In terms of age and education level variables, employees’ perceptions of leaders’ abusive management and self-efficacy are significantly different from their job performances, respectively (p < 0.01).

VEP and VFP are examined under two decompositions, idiosyncratic vulnerability and covariate vulnerability, by constructing a multilevel structure model. The analysis accounts for two critical problems (selection bias and endogeneity) through an endogenous switching regression model. Generally, the results indicate the positive impacts of credit uptake on poverty alleviation and VEP reduction. Nevertheless, credit uptake increases VFP. Noticeably, compared to other categories of credit, productive credit is found to be more pronounced in reducing either idiosyncratic or covariate vulnerability. There is also suggestive evidence that although credit has positive effects overall, taking on either formal or semiformal credit has negative impacts on both poverty and vulnerability reduction. Hence, towards formal credit, government policies should concentrate more on credit costs and support preferential loan rates for poor rural households for productive purposes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Households; Poverty; Rural Credit; Rural Vietnam; Vulnerability To Poverty; Credit Provision; Empirical Analysis; Poverty; Regression Analysis; Rural Area; Vulnerability; Viet Nam,credit provision; empirical analysis; poverty; regression analysis; rural area; vulnerability; Viet Nam,,,,"Adams, Dale W., Rural financial markets in low-income countries: Recent controversies and lessons, World Development, 14, 4, pp. 477-487, (1986); Econometrica, (1977); Austin, Peter C., An introduction to propensity score methods for reducing the effects of confounding in observational studies, Multivariate Behavioral Research, 46, 3, pp. 399-424, (2011); Characteristics of the Vietnamese Rural Economy Evidence from A 2016 Rural Household Survey in 12 Provinces of Viet Nam, (2017); Research Institute for Economics Business Administration Rieb Kobe University, (2012); Banerjee, Abhijit V., The miracle of microfinance?

New community cases, stringency index, number of tests, and active cases were analyzed. Using a linear regression model, an independent variable was utilized for a given date to predict the future number of community cases. Results: Research results show that outpatient cases, the stringency, and Google Mobility Trend were all significantly associated with the number of COVID-19 community cases from the sixth day to the ninth day. The model predicting community cases on the eighth day (R2=0.8906) was the most appropriate showing outpatients, residential index, grocery and pharmacy index, retail and recreation index, and workplaces index were positively related (β<inf>1</inf>=24.2, 95% CI: 20.3–26.3, P<0.0001; β<inf>2</inf>=277.7, 95% CI: 171.8–408.2, P<0.0001; β<inf>3</inf>=112.4, 95% CI: 79.8–158.3, P<0.0001; β<inf>4</inf>=73.1, 95% CI: 53- 04.4, P<0.0001; β<inf>5=</inf>57.2, 95% CI: 25.2–96.8, P=0.001, respectively). In contrast, inpatients, park index, and adjusted stringency index were negatively related to the number of community cases (β<inf>6</inf>=-2.8, 95% CI: -3.9 – -1.6, P<0.0001; β<inf>7</inf>=-33, 95% CI: -43.6 – -27, P<0.0001; β<inf>8</inf>=-14.4, 95% CI: -20.1– -12, P<0.0001, respectively). Conclusion: Outpatient cases and indexes of Community Mobility Reports were associated with COVID-19 community cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Covid-19; Health Policy; Introduction; Japan; Outpatients; Social Isolation,,,,"We would like to appreciate all the teams of Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) (Johns Hopkins University), Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and Google for public data of COVID-19.

This paper presents the results of an empirical study investigating the moderating roles of information technology link and information sharing on the relationship between supplier development, knowledge absorption from customers, and supply chain performance. Statistical techniques such as measurement test, correlation analysis, and regression analysis are applied to analyze the data collected during the Round 4 of the High Performance Manufacturing (HPM) Project. The data sample includes 304 manufacturing plants operating in 13 countries including Brazil, China, Finland, German, Italy, Israel, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Analytical results indicate that a supply chain would perform better when focal firms invest their effort in supplier development and knowledge absorption activities and develop a strong link with suppliers and customers through information technology systems. Information technology links with suppliers and customers have significant moderating roles in strengthening the relationship between supplier development, knowledge absorption from customers, and supply chain performance. Moreover, information sharing exchange with suppliers were found to make the association between supplier development and supply chain performance becomes more pronounced. The empirical results contribute to the existing literature of information sharing and supply chain coordination in supply chain management. In addition, this study provides several practical implications, such that information technology linkage and information sharing activities should be considered as the platforms for organizations to interact with different supply chain partners for achieving high supply chain performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Information Sharing; Information Technology Link; Knowledge Absorption; Supplier Development; Supply Chain Performance,,,,,"Baihaqi, Imam, The impact of information sharing in supply chains on organisational performance: An empirical study, Production Planning and Control, 24, 8-9, pp. 743-758, (2013); Braojos, Jessica, Impact of IT integration on the firm's knowledge absorption and desorption, Information and Management, 57, 7, (2020); Carr, Amelia S., Communication methods, information sharing, supplier development and performance: An empirical study of their relationships, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 27, 4, pp. 346-370, (2007); Chau, Ka Yin, Investigation of critical success factors for improving supply chain quality management in manufacturing, Enterprise Information Systems, 15, 10, pp. 1418-1437, (2021); Chen, Liang, A knowledge management perspective of supplier development: Evidence from supply chain scholars and consultants, Knowledge and Process Management, 25, 4, pp. 247-257, (2018); Fawcett, Stanley E., Information sharing and supply chain performance: The role of connectivity and willingness, Supply Chain Management, 12, 5, pp. 358-368, (2007); Flynn, Barbara B., On Theory in Supply Chain Uncertainty and its Implications for Supply Chain Integration, Journal of Supply Chain Management, 52, 3, pp. 3-27, (2016); Gassmann, Oliver, Negative side effects of customer integration, International Journal of Technology Management, 50, 1, pp. 43-63, (2010); Glavee-Geo, Richard, Does supplier development lead to supplier satisfaction and relationship continuation?, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, 3, (2019); MIS Quarterly, (2012)",,Technical University of Liberec,,,,,,12123609,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144190294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional notions have postulated that the Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers were replaced or absorbed into the Neolithic Austronesian farming communities. Yet, some evidence has indicated that sparse numbers of non-Austronesian individuals continued to live in the remote mountains as late as the 1800s. The cranial morphometric study of human skeletal remains unearthed from the Xiaoma Caves in eastern Taiwan, for the first time, validates the prior existence of small stature hunter-gatherers 6000 years ago in the preceramic phase. This female individual shared remarkable cranial affinities and small stature characteristics with the Indigenous Southeast Asians, particularly the Negritos in northern Luzon.

Design/methodology/approach - Eleven managers attended and applied the Q-sort method to evaluate the unidimensionality, reliability and validity of research concepts. Afterwards, a comparative model containing the single effects of risks on supply chain performance was developed as a basis for comparison with the theoretical model. The impacts of each risk on supply chain performance were demonstrated in both models. When the parameters of the theoretical model are greater than those in the competitive model, the resonant effect mechanism is proven and vice versa. Findings - 63% variance of supply chain performance was explained by our risk model, which includes positive and negative resonant effects between risks. It is a remarkable rate compared with the comparative model and previous studies. Whilst a positive relationship (α ≥ 0) increases the effect of the impacted risk on the output, a negative relationship (α ≤ 0) decreases this effect, bringing benefits for companies which “see” these opportunities. Thus, practitioners should treat risk as an opportunity rather than a threat. Research limitations/implications - A positive optimal resonant model is necessary to maximize the impact of risks on supply chain performance. Hence, companies can predict the worst-case scenario when six risks occur simultaneously. However, companies can devise mitigating techniques if a negative optimal resonant model is detected. Although risks can not be eliminated, their impact is likely to be abated by using a new paradigm. Originality/value - The data used in this research is from a large-scale survey supported by Japanese Government to promote ASEAN sustainable socio-economic development.

High-speed rail (HSR) has been mentioned recently and is expected as the best and most modern transport option in long-distance trips in Vietnam. However, research studies have paid scant regard to how HSR’s attributes may affect potential users, and therefore the motivations and barriers to adopting HSR are still unknown. Objectives: This study aimed at examining motivations and barriers to take-up HSR for considering customers’ preference on the proper attributes and levels of HSR. Method: This study drew on a nationwide survey and conjoint analysis to investigate customers’ behaviour. Results: In Vietnam’s context, HSR ticket was found to be the principal barrier to adoption, whereas the speed of HSR was identified as the least important behavioural driver amongst potential HSR users. The results show that HSR design and planning should provide a combination of minimum check-in and waiting time, a 20-min frequency, average speed of 250 km/h, all add-on services and facilities, ticketing of approximately VND 500-700 thousand per 300-500 km and nearby all-day parking. Conclusion: This investigation has demonstrated the value of conjoint analysis to compare a wide range of attributes associated with consumers’ decision to use HSR. The findings indicate that in countries such as Vietnam, in particular, where train usage is low, policymakers and transportation agencies seeking to boost the use of HSR must take attributes other than fare into consideration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attributes; Check-in And Waiting Time; Conjoint Analysis; High-speed Rail; Levels; Ticket Fare,,,,,"Álvarez-SanJaime, Óscar, A model of internal and external competition in a High Speed Rail line, Economics of Transportation, 4, 3, pp. 178-187, (2015); Behrens, Christiaan, Intermodal competition in the London-Paris passenger market: High-Speed Rail and air transport, Journal of Urban Economics, 71, 3, pp. 278-288, (2012); Borhan, Muhamad Nazri Bin, Extending the theory of planned behaviour to predict the intention to take the new high-speed rail for intercity travel in Libya: Assessment of the influence of novelty seeking, trust and external influence, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 130, pp. 373-384, (2019); Borsati, Mattia, On the modal shift from motorway to high-speed rail: evidence from Italy, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 137, pp. 145-164, (2020); Campa, Juan Luis, High speed rail effects on tourism: Spanish empirical evidence derived from China's modelling experience, Journal of Transport Geography, 57, pp. 44-54, (2016); Asrdlf 2012 Conference Special Session on High Speed Rail Tourism and Territories, (2012); Passengers Choice Between High Speed Train and Air Transport, (2022); Gehrt, Kenneth C., Understanding preference for high-speed rail service: A consumer logistics perspective, Innovative Marketing, 3, 4, pp. 32-41, (2007); Decision 318 Qd Ttg on Approving the Strategy for Developing Transportation Service to 2020 Oriented to 2030, (2014); Journal of Consumer Research, (1978)",,AOSIS (pty) Ltd,,,,,,23108789; 19955235,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136807123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study presents a case study to examine the financial feasibility of developing and operating a new metro line through property value capture and land-use control in Hanoi. First, property prices are estimated with local data for both residential and office properties, using hedonic price models. Next, a travel demand model, including trip generation and attraction, trip distribution, and travel mode choice sub-models, is estimated with person trip survey data, following a conventional four-step model framework. Subsequently, multiple scenarios are built for a hypothetical investment in an MRT line in Hanoi. The scenarios are assumed considering socio-demographics and transportation infrastructure in the context of new taxation levied on local properties near MRT stations and land-use controls with respect to population and employment to increase their densities near MRT stations. The estimated models are applied to each scenario to estimate the expected financial viability of MRT development and operation. The results reveal that the property value capture and land-use control could significantly improve the operator's profitability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Developing Cities; Financial Feasibility; Mass Rapid Transit; Property Value Capture; Transit-oriented Development,,,,The data on Japan's railway investment in the case study was partially provided by Tokyo Metro Co.

In other words, religious beliefs are indicative of the role of religion in the individual and social life of people, as well as adherence to values and beliefs in daily life, performing religious practices and rituals and participating in activities of religious organisations. Religious beliefs are a set of dos and don’ts, and values are considered one of the most important psychological supports that can provide meaning in all moments of life and save a person from meaninglessness by providing explanatory support in specific situations. In addition, work conscience is defined as a feeling of inner commitment to comply with agreed-upon requirements for work. In other words, work conscience means heartfelt satisfaction and practical commitment to the tasks that a person is supposed to perform properly, in a way that there will be no negligence in performing the duty even if no supervisor oversees the activity. Given the significant role of nurses in hospitals, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the religious beliefs of healthcare employees have become more important. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of religious beliefs on the work conscience of 1800 Muslim nurses in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Standard questionnaires were applied to assess the respondents’ religious beliefs and work conscience. In addition, data analyses (Cronbach’s alpha, Pearson’s correlation, etc.) were performed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). According to the results, religious beliefs have a positive effect on nurses’ work conscience (p = 0.822). Contribution: The findings of this study showed that the employees of an organisation, especially nurses and healthcare staff, can rely on their religious beliefs and benefit from their advantages in order to strengthen their work conscience during a hard time such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Muslim Nurses; Religion; Religious Beliefs; Work Conscience,,,,,"Afshari, Davood, Demographic predictors of resilience among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Work, 68, 2, pp. 297-303, (2021); Berkman, Lisa F., The role of social relations in health promotion, Psychosomatic Medicine, 57, 3, pp. 245-254, (1995); Cerit, Birgül, Being a Nurse at the Ground Zero of Care in Turkey During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study, Journal of Religion and Health, 61, 1, pp. 827-850, (2022); Costa, Paul T., The five-factor model of personality and its relevance to personality disorders, Journal of Personality Disorders, 6, 4, pp. 343-359, (1992); Journal of Hacettepe University Faculty of Nursing, (2020); Fernandez, Ritin Santiago, Implications for COVID-19: A systematic review of nurses’ experiences of working in acute care hospital settings during a respiratory pandemic, International Journal of Nursing Studies, 111, (2020); Journal of Happiness Studies, (2002); Medrxiv, (2020); Hui, David Shu Cheong, The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health — The latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, International Journal of Infectious Diseases, 91, pp. 264-266, (2020); Jiang, Lixin, Meaningful Work and Affective Commitment: A Moderated Mediation Model of Positive Work Reflection and Work Centrality, Journal of Business and Psychology, 33, 4, pp. 545-558, (2018)",,AOSIS (pty) Ltd,,,,,,20728050; 02599422,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134183204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of tourism policy and governance in Vietnam cannot set aside the evolution of the Marxist political economic doctrine regulating the socio-economic system of the country since 1975. The transition from the central plan to the market-driven economy has been reflected in tourism policy making and implementation. Owing to its high international integration, its exceptional vulnerability to changes in global trends while being well connected to domestic consumption and mobilization of resources for post-war development, tourism mirrors the notion of a transitional economy better than any other sector. Current trends towards environmental and cultural protection also clearly imprint on the policy of tourism development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,"Bähre, Heike, Privatisation during market economy transformation as a motor of development, pp. 33-58, (2006); Bianchi, Raoul V., The political economy of tourism development: A critical review, Annals of Tourism Research, 70, pp. 88-102, (2018); Bramwell, Bill, Governance, the state and sustainable tourism: A political economy approach, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 19, 4-5, pp. 459-477, (2011); Tourism and Development in Southeast Asia, (2020); Austrian Journal of South East Asian Studies, (2011); Burns, Peter M., Tourism and politics: Global frameworks and local realities, pp. 1-409, (2006); Cbre Hotels Insights Implications of Covid 19 on the Vietnam Hospitality Market, (2020); Pacific Tourism Review, (1997); Cooper, Malcolm J.M., Tourism in Vietnam: Doi Moi and the realities of tourism in the 1990s, pp. 167-177, (2012); Dredge, Dianne, Policy networks and the local organisation of tourism, Tourism Management, 27, 2, pp. 269-280, (2006)",,CABI International,,,,,,,9781789242782; 9781789242799,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129921937,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the mid-1960s, Japan has placed a strong focus on teacher factors for improving the quality of education. Japan, mainly through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has been providing support to strengthen teacher capacity by working together with partner countries through trial and error on the ground. As the education agenda and practices place increasing emphasis on learning in the 2010s, JICA’s focus is shifting from “teacher capacity” to “children’s learning” by paying attention to consistency and coherence between curriculum, textbooks, lessons, and assessment. This chapter describes the features of and changes to Japanese approaches in this field by dividing it into five stages. The chapter also discusses the historical background of each stage and connections between the stages. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Basic Education; Children’s Learning; Japan’s Oda; Learning Assessment; Mathematics And Science Education; Teacher Capacity; Teachers’ Classroom Practices; Textbook Development; Universal Primary Education,,,,"Consequently, in FY 1966, Japan started dispatching science education experts and providing the equipment they would need for instruction. The Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency (OTCA), the forerunner of JICA, was commissioned and financed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to carry out the program (JICA, 1981). Specifically, five countries were selected every year from among those in Asia and Africa. One science education expert4 (physics or chemistry) was dispatched to each of the partner countries, staying there for 6 months to give guidance and advice on science education. The countries were also provided with the equipment (three million yen per country) necessary for their instruction (Hayashi, 1970). The five countries selected for the first year were Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kenya, and Iran. In subsequent decades, one expert (or in some cases two) was dispatched to each country, mainly countries in Asia.","Ad Hoc Council on Educational Cooperation for Asian Countries, (1972); Akyeampong, Kwame, Improving teaching and learning of basic maths and reading in Africa: Does teacher preparation count?, International Journal of Educational Development, 33, 3, pp. 272-282, (2013); undefined; From, (2002); undefined; From, (2015); Monthly Journal of Monbusho, (1970); Firipin no Rika Kyoiku, (1969); Tai no Rika Kyoiku, (1969); Journal of International Cooperation in Education, (2011)",,Springer,,,,,,22149791; 15735397,,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127910880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
