Traditional analysis methods often suffer from subjectivity and may not capture complex, non-linear relationships between risk factors. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven approach to predict and diagnose depression more accurately by analyzing large and complex datasets. Methods: This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014 to predict depression using six supervised ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with a score of 10 or higher indicating moderate to severe depression. The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80% and 20%, respectively), and model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, AUC, and F1 score. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were used to identify the critical risk factors and interpret the contributions of each feature to the prediction. Results: XGBoost was identified as the best-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, AUC, and F1 score. SHAP analysis highlighted the most significant predictors of depression: the ratio family income to poverty (PIR), sex, hypertension, serum cotinine and hydroxycotine, BMI, education level, glucose levels, age, marital status, and renal function (eGFR). Conclusion: We developed ML models to predict depression and utilized SHAP for interpretation. This approach identifies key factors associated with depression, encompassing socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related aspects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Depression; Depressive disorder; eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost); Light Gradient Boosted Machine (Light-GBM); Logistic regression; Naïve bayes; Random forest; Shapley Addictive exPlanations (SHAP); Supervised machine learning; Support Vector Machine (SVM)","adult; aged; depression; diagnosis; female; human; machine learning; major depression; male; middle aged; nutrition; United States; young adult; Adult; Aged; Depressive Disorder; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: We would like to express our gratitude to all the participants who generously volunteered for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

However, it is still challenging to identify the structural factors that promote hydrogen insertion and extraction and to develop materials whose functional properties can be largely modulated by inserting and extracting hydrogen through solid-state reactions at room temperature. In this study, guided by theoretical calculations on the energies of oxygen reduction and hydrogen insertion reactions with oxygen-deficient perovskite oxides, we demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy ordering in Sr(Fe<inf>1−x</inf>Co<inf>x</inf>)O<inf>y</inf> (SFCO) epitaxial films can be stabilized by increasing the Co content (x ≥ 0.3) and revealed that it plays a key role in promoting proton accommodation into the SFCO lattice. We also show that the electrical resistance of SFCO films can be reversibly modulated by electrochemical proton insertion and extraction, and the modulation exceeds three orders of magnitude for Sr(Fe<inf>0.5</inf>Co<inf>0.5</inf>)O<inf>2.5</inf> epitaxial films. Our results provide guidelines for controlling material properties through the insertion and extraction of hydrogen and for designing and exploring hydrogen-insertion materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","cobalt; hydrogen; iron; oxide; oxygen; perovskite; strontium; proton; electrochemical method; extraction method; induced response; reduction; Article; controlled study; density functional theory; deprotonation; electric resistance; electrochemistry; energy; protonation; reaction analysis; reduction (chemistry); room temperature; solid state; article; calculation; epitaxy; hypoxia","","cobalt, 7440-48-4; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; oxide, 16833-27-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; perovskite, 12194-71-7, 61027-03-0; strontium, 7440-24-6; proton, 12408-02-5, 12586-59-3","This work was partly supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (no. 19H05816 (D.K.), 19H05823(Y.S.), 20H05883 (Y.M.), 20H02569 (Y.M.), 21H01810 (D.K.), 22KK0075 (Y.S.), 22H04617 (T.M.), 22H04620 (R.A.), 23H04110 (D.K.), 23H05457 (Y.S.), and 24KJ1371 (Y.I.)) and by grants for the Integrated Research Consortium on Chemical Sciences and the International Collaborative Research Program of the Institute for Chemical Research in Kyoto University from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.

To add new evidence and expand research, this study investigated the association between traffic congestion and booking orders of RH service users in Hanoi, Vietnam. A total of 50,767 booking records on RH users of a private operator in Hanoi were used for empirical analysis. The study established the following four hypotheses: (1) the frequency of RH bookings in congested areas is lower than that in less congested areas; (2) the frequency of RH bookings using an app-based method in congested areas is higher than that in less congested areas during evening-peak hours; (3) the effects of built environment, sociodemographics, and transportation facilities on the frequency of RH bookings in congested areas are less significant than those in less congested areas during evening-peak hours; and (4) the effects of built environment, sociodemographics, and transportation facilities on the frequency of RH bookings are lower in congested than in less congested areas. After identifying more and less congested areas, the four hypotheses were statistically tested with grid-zone-based data matched using the Mahalanobis distance method between the two areas. The results of the statistical tests showed that Hypotheses (1) and (2) were supported by empirical data. Next, the estimation results of the regression models to explain RH service bookings with built environment, sociodemographic, and transportation facilities factors by time period reveal that Hypotheses (3) and (4) were also supported. Finally, policy implications were presented from the findings, including (i) requiring RH service provides to improve their service quality and attract more users during periods of serious traffic congestion to promote a modal shift from private modes to RH services and thus reduce traffic congestion; (ii) providing technical support to traditional taxi companies to use web-based service apps so that the disparity between traditional taxi and RH services could be mitigated; and (iii) identifying the heterogeneity in RH service demand across urban characteristics for urban travel demand forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Booking order; Developing city; Ride-hailing; Time of day; Traffic congestion","service quality; taxi transport; traffic congestion; travel demand; urban transport; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","The RH booking data used in this study were provided by EMDDI Joint Stock Company, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.

However, as the industry pursues profit targets, there is also a pressing need to consider its sustainability. One challenge is the lack of detailed information on the life cycle of natural rubber products, particularly regarding energy consumption, which could hinder sustainable practices. Based on an on-site survey of six natural rubber processing companies in the Southeast and Central Highlands of Vietnam, this field research aims to evaluate the sustainability of the natural rubber industry by examining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy and water consumption throughout the life cycle of all products. Over two years, biogas, wastewater, and sludge samples were collected multiple times from each factory involved in the research and facilitated with both testing the characteristics and components of these samples, as well as calculating their carbon footprint by the 2006 Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). GHG emissions from the two most dominant Vietnamese natural rubber products were 589 and 133 kg CO<inf>2</inf>eq., respectively, generated from each ton of Standard Vietnamese Rubber (SVR) and Centrifuged Latex (CL) products produced. Our study identified three main sources of GHG emissions in the Vietnamese natural rubber industry: high electricity use during the SVR production process, vast ammonia requirements for the CL production process, and direct CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from the regulation tanks of the wastewater processes.

This study seeks to evaluate the extent to which these models can effectively meet the needs of older adults by examining responses to 23 questions posed to ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude AI, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Search. The responses were evaluated based on their accuracy, comprehensibility, relevance, and conciseness. Both the LLMs and a panel of seven researchers assessed the answers. ChatGPT received the highest ratings for accuracy and comprehensibility, Google Gemini for conciseness, and both ChatGPT and Claude AI were rated highest for reliability. These ratings were further analysed to compare the performance of the LLMs with that of the researchers. The LLMs generally awarded higher ratings of 4 or 5 most of the time whereas the ratings of the researchers were more varied. Microsoft Copilot most closely aligned with the researchers’ evaluations of accuracy and comprehensibility, while Claude AI and ChatGPT showed the closest alignment for conciseness and relevance, respectively. Furthermore, to identify which platform may be best suited for different types of information, the questions were divided into five categories, with ChatGPT emerging as the best suited LLM in most categories. These findings, along with the rubric and research methodologies utilised in this study, can be replicated to assess the performance of LLMs across different research areas and domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ChatGPT; Claude AI; Gerontechnology; Google Gemini; Large language models; Machine learning; Microsoft Copilot","ChatGPT; Claude AI; Gerontechnology; Google geminus; Google+; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; MicroSoft; Microsoft copilot","","","This study was supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) COI-NEXT Grant number JPMJPF2018.","Thirunavukarasu, Arun James, Large language models in medicine, Nature Medicine, 29, 8, pp. 1930-1940, (2023); Moor, Michael M., Foundation models for generalist medical artificial intelligence, Nature, 616, 7956, pp. 259-265, (2023); Hristidis, Vagelis, ChatGPT vs Google for Queries Related to Dementia and Other Cognitive Decline: Comparison of Results, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 25, (2023); Babylonian Journal of Machine Learning, (2023); Imran, Muhammad, Google Gemini as a next generation AI educational tool: a review of emerging educational technology, Smart Learning Environments, 11, 1, (2024); Moller, Johanna, Toward Innovation in Healthcare: An Analysis of the Digital Behavior of Older People in Europe and Japan for the Introduction of a Technological Coaching System, Healthcare (Switzerland), 12, 2, (2024); Dawadi, Research, Internet of things controlled home objects for the elderly, 5, pp. 244-251, (2017); Berner, Jessica S., Factors influencing Internet usage in older adults (65 years and above) living in rural and urban Sweden, Health Informatics Journal, 21, 3, pp. 237-249, (2015); Wilson-Menzfeld, Gemma, Understanding older adults' use of social technology and the factors influencing use, Ageing and Society, 43, 1, pp. 222-245, (2023); Aggarwal, Bhumika M., Impact of the use of the internet on quality of life in older adults: Review of literature, Primary Health Care Research and Development, 21, (2020)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","27310809","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004551296"

This study evaluates the performance of Ethereum-based IoT systems using resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 3) on a private blockchain. Performance metrics, including CPU, memory, disk usage, power consumption, and latency, were analyzed across three consensus mechanisms: Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). To address the blockchain’s latency performance, we introduced the metrics Transaction-oriented latency (ToL) and Block-oriented latency (BoL) to characterize latency under PoS, capturing the distinctive dynamics of PoS. Our findings show that PoA achieves the lowest resource consumption, with CPU usage reduced by 98% compared to PoW and 20% compared to PoS, and power consumption decreased by 50% from PoW and 14% from PoS. Further, to assess blockchain scalability, we varied transaction transmission rates under PoA, identifying its impact on performance.

However, the impact of residue quality on SOM dynamics in converted upland soils remains unclear. Here, we evaluated residue-derived carbon (C) accumulation patterns and stabilization pathways in converted upland soils using an in-situ incubation experiment with six different 13C/15N-labeled plant residues (leaf, stem, root) of soybean and maize (C:N ratios = 15.3−53.6; lignin = 5.9−9.2 %) applied to converted upland soils (pH = 6.15; SOM = 13.9 g C kg−1; clay = 32.8 %). Total C, N, and the atom percentages of 13C and 15N were measured in bulk soil and SOM fractions at 30, 90, 180, and 360 days after installation (DAI). The results showed that residue-derived C in mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) was similar, ranging 23.6 %–25.5 % of added C across residues, except for soybean root (28.3 %), while the accumulation rate and pathway varied by residue quality. In the initial stage (0–30 DAI), lower C:N ratios and lignin contents correlated with faster MAOM formation, indicating that high-quality residues rapidly generate MAOM. These rapidly neoformed residue-derived MAOM were dominant (74 % of total neoformed MAOM) and remained stable across 1-year incubation, as indicated by their consistent C:N ratio. Later (30–90 DAI), MAOM formation rates rose with increasing C:N ratios and lignin, showing lower-quality residues generated MAOM more rapidly and consistently—likely through continued conversion of free/occluded particulate organic matter, supported by a decline in their C:N ratios. Our study demonstrates that residue quality governs the rate and pathway of residue-derived C stabilization: high-quality residues rapidly form stable MAOM, whereas low-quality residues drive long-term MAOM accumulation. These insights underscore the critical role of residue type and quality in regulating SOM dynamics in converted upland soils. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","13C/15N double isotopic tracing; C sequestration; C:N ratios; Land use conversion; Lignin; Mineral-associated organic matter","Biological materials; Forestry; Grain (agricultural product); Land use; Landforms; Plants (botany); Soil pollution; Soil quality; Stabilization; 13C/15N double isotopic tracing; C sequestration; C:N ratio; Isotopic tracing; Land use conversion; Mineral-associated organic matter; Organics; Plant residues; Residue quality; Upland soil; Lignin; carbon; carbon 13; lignin; mineral associated organic matter; nitrogen 15; particulate organic matter; unclassified drug; mineral; nitrogen; accumulation rate; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; environmental conditions; isotopic analysis; land use change; nitrogen isotope; plant residue; soil organic matter; soybean; Article; bioaccumulation; bulk density; concentration (parameter); controlled study; converted upland soil; isotope tracing; maize; mineralization; nonhuman; paddy soil; particle size; plant leaf; plant root; plant stem; quality control; soil amendment; soil depth; soil water content; agriculture; chemistry; soil; Land Use; Organic Matter; Plant Residues; Quality; Ratios; Agriculture; Carbon; Glycine max; Minerals; Nitrogen; Plant Roots; Soil; Zea mays","","carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon 13, 14762-74-4; lignin, 9005-53-2; nitrogen 15, 14390-96-6; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Carbon; Lignin; Minerals; Nitrogen; Soil","The study was primarily supported by the NEDO-Moon Shot project (B-3J) and partially supported by JST Grant Number JPMJPF2014 and JSPS Grant Number 20H03113 , 24K01889 , and 24K23918 .

We recently developed a sorbitol-responsive in situ gelling material (SRG) solution, which increases viscosity by diffusing out pre-added sorbitol upon contact with heart tissue without external stimulation. Here, this study demonstrates that intramyocardial injection of MSC-loaded SRG (MSC/SRG) improves cardiac function and facilitates tissue repair following acute myocardial ischemia in rats, and the underlying mechanisms are elucidated. MSC/SRG is more effective than either MSC or SRG alone in preventing cardiac dysfunction and fibrotic remodeling while stimulating angiogenesis. The optimized SRG consists of 25 mg/mL boronic acid group-bearing polymer, 10 mg/mL polyvinyl alcohol, and 5 mg/mL sorbitol, which prolongs MSC survival and enhances their paracrine function in in vitro and in vivo assays. Sorbitol supplementation increases MSC proliferation, modulates cytokine secretion from MSCs in a concentration-dependent manner, and promotes angiogenesis in vitro. These findings suggest that the sorbitol in SRG supports MSC survival and enhances MSC paracrine activity. The SRG may facilitate the therapeutic potential of MSC and hydrogel-based interventions for myocardial ischemia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Angiogenesis; In situ gelling material; Mesenchymal stem cell; Myocardial infarction; Sorbitol","Cardiology; Cell culture; Gelation; Heart; Hydrogels; Medical applications; Rats; Repair; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Angiogenesis; Cell survival; In situ gelling material; In-situ-gelling; In-vitro; Mesenchymal stem cell; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial ischemia; Paracrine; Sorbitol; Flowcharting; Stem cells; cytokine; fibroblast growth factor 21; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; polymer; polyvinyl alcohol; sorbitol; transforming growth factor beta1; vasculotropin; gel; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biocompatibility; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; heart; heart function; heart infarction; heart infarction size; heart muscle ischemia; in vitro study; in vivo study; mesenchymal stem cell; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; rat; tissue repair; animal; cardiac muscle; cell culture; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; male; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; Sprague Dawley rat; therapy; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Gels; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Paracrine Communication; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","polyvinyl alcohol, 37380-95-3, 9002-89-5; sorbitol, 26566-34-7, 50-70-4, 53469-19-5; vasculotropin, 127464-60-2; Gels; Sorbitol","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Intramural Research Fund of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (21-1-29), AMED under grant number JP22bm1123003 to T.Y.

The accuracy of the numerical method is verified by comparing numerical results with experimental data through a grid sensitivity study. The roll decay tests of the vessel at full-scale and model-scale at various forward speeds are simulated, and it is noticed that scale effects on roll motion occur when forward speed is nil or low. To further understand the impacts of scale on damping components, forced roll tests with different forward speeds are simulated, roll damping coefficients are determined, the flow field created by roll motion and forward speed near bilge keels is observed. It is found that the scale effects affect both the frictional and bilge keel damping components. At low Froude number, the difference of the relative velocity distributions for the height (or breadth) of bilge keels between model (model-scale) and ship (full-scale) is proved as the cause of the scale effects on the bilge keel component. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bilge-keel component; Forced roll; Full-scale roll motion; Roll damping coefficient; Roll decay; Scale effects","Containers; Naval architecture; Numerical methods; Rolls (machine components); Ships; Velocity distribution; Bilge keel; Bilge-keel component; Damping coefficients; Forced roll; Full-scale roll motion; Roll damping; Roll damping coefficient; Roll decay; Roll motions; Scale effects; Damping","","","This work was financially supported by JST SPRING, Grant Number JPMJSP2139.","Zhang, Heng, Scale effect studies on hydrodynamic performance for DTMB 5415 Using CFD, Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE, 2, (2018); Song, Kewei, Experimental and numerical study on the scale effect of stern flap on ship resistance and flow field, Ships and Offshore Structures, 15, 9, pp. 981-997, (2020); Doğrul, Ali, Scale effect on ship resistance components and form factor, Ocean Engineering, 209, (2020); Doğrul, Ali, NUMERICAL PREDICTION OF SCALE EFFECTS ON THE PROPULSION PERFORMANCE OF JOUBERT BB2 SUBMARINE, Brodogradnja, 73, 2, pp. 17-42, (2022); Ma, Zhongxin, Influence of scale effect on flow field offset for ships in confined waters, Brodogradnja, 75, 1, (2024); Full Scale Investigation of Bilge Keel Effectiveness at Forward Speed, (2008); Broglia, Riccardo, Experimental and numerical analysis of the roll decay motion for a patrol boat, Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, pp. 709-716, (2009); Söder, Carl Johan, Assessment of ship roll damping through full scale and model scale experiments and semi-empirical methods, Fluid Mechanics and its Applications, 119, pp. 177-190, (2019); Proceedings of the 32nd Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics, (2018); Components of Roll Damping of Ship at Forward Speed, (1978)","","University of Zagreb Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture","","","","","","0007215X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015083385"

Leveraging this unique property, proaerolysin is widely used in diagnostic tests for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a disease caused by somatic mutations in the PIGA, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of GPI anchors. Beyond diagnostics, proaerolysin has recently been applied in basic research, including its use as a counter-selection agent in genetic manipulations and as an engineered nanopore for single-molecule detection. Although the bacterial expression and purification of proaerolysin have been previously reported, the yields were low due to its low solubility. Here, we demonstrate that using the SHuffle E. coli strain, which facilitates the disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm, significantly improves the solubility and proper folding of proaerolysin. We achieved a high yield of proaerolysin, approximately 3 mg from a 50 mL bacterial culture, with a purity exceeding 99 %. The functionality of recombinant proaerolysin was confirmed through testing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), demonstrating that this high-yield production method provides a reliable and cost-effective source of functional proaerolysin for a wide range of biotechnological applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","aerolysin; bacterial toxin; hemolysin; pore forming cytotoxic protein; recombinant protein; Aeromonas hydrophila; animal; biosynthesis; chemistry; Escherichia coli; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; mouse; mouse embryonic stem cell; solubility; Animals; Bacterial Toxins; Hemolysin Proteins; Mice; Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Solubility","","aerolysin, 53126-24-2; aerolysin; Bacterial Toxins; Hemolysin Proteins; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Recombinant Proteins","We appreciate all members of the Miyanari lab for their helpful discussion.

This study assessed whether GB improves drought tolerance in Passiflora edulis Sims f. flavicarpa, a crop sensitive to irregular rainfall. A 3 × 2 × 2 factorial design was employed, combining three drought levels (control, mild, and severe), two propagation methods (seedlings and cuttings), and two GB treatments (0 and 100 mM), with 60 plants and five replicates. Plants were grown under controlled conditions, and irrigation was adjusted to maintain target field capacities. Chlorophyll content was monitored daily, and agronomic and physiological traits were measured after 45 days. GB application influenced leaf water dynamics and stress responses. Cuttings generally showed clearer improvements in drought tolerance when treated with GB, while seedlings exhibited more variable outcomes. These differences appear linked to the propagation method and developmental stage as cuttings were at a more advanced phase, whereas seedlings remained vegetative. Overall, the results demonstrate that exogenous GB can enhance drought tolerance in passion fruit, although its effectiveness is propagation-dependent and context-specific, highlighting the need to tailor its application to cultivation practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","abiotic stress; fruit production; osmoprotectant; tropical horticulture","betaine; chlorophyll; agronomics; Article; chlorophyll content; controlled study; drought stress; drought tolerance; evapotranspiration; factorial design; field capacity; nonhuman; Passiflora edulis sims f. flavicarpa; passion fruit; plant epidermis; plant growth; plant leaf; plant metabolism; plant physiology; plant stoma; plant stress; plant water relation; seedling; stem cutting; vegetative propagation; drought; drug effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Passiflora; physiological stress; physiology; Betaine; Chlorophyll; Droughts; Plant Leaves; Seedlings; Stress, Physiological","","betaine, 107-43-7, 590-46-5; chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; Betaine; Chlorophyll","Funding text 1: The author gratefully acknowledges the Tokyo University of Agriculture for providing laboratory space and equipment used in the experiment.

This study aimed to establish a novel model for accurately predicting this performance in relation to drinking water treatment. The model was designed to enhance the flow within the submerged flat-sheet nanofiltration membrane module, which was organized as a cross-flow filtration system to prevent membrane fouling and ensure high performance. A mathematical expression was derived from experiments to estimate the full-scale flat-sheet nanofiltration permeate flux based on concentration polarization phenomenon on the membrane surface. The simulation results demonstrated that the efficiency between the tank with and without baffles was significant owing to the uniform distribution of the local shear stress, mass transfer coefficient, and permeate flux. Furthermore, the baffle configuration influenced the cost of nanofiltration for clean water production; a tank with five baffles demonstrated the lowest production cost at an optimal inlet flow rate of 3.6 m3 h−1, offering promising cost savings. Overall, by employing this model and simulating various tank configurations, the permeate flux of the submerged flat-sheet nanofiltration membrane module can be predicted, thereby enabling considerable optimization of tank design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational fluid dynamics; Concentration polarization; Cost optimization; Full-scale simulation; Loss model; Shear stress","computational fluid dynamics; concentration (composition); design; drinking water; filtration; model; optimization; shear stress; water treatment","","","This study was supported by the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency - Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (JPMJSA2201).","undefined, (2021); Watson, Bruce M., Low-energy membrane nanofiltration for removal of color, organics and hardness from drinking water supplies, Desalination, 72, 1-2, pp. 11-22, (1989); Fujioka, Takahiro, Submerged nanofiltration without pre-treatment for direct advanced drinking water treatment, Chemosphere, 265, (2021); Boivin, Sandrine, Membrane fouling control and contaminant removal during direct nanofiltration of surface water, Desalination, 581, (2024); Liu, Meihong, Submerged nanofiltration of biologically treated molasses fermentation wastewater for the removal of melanoidins, Chemical Engineering Journal, 223, pp. 388-394, (2013); Röhricht, Markus, Elimination of pharmaceuticals from wastewater by submerged nanofiltration plate modules, Desalination, 250, 3, pp. 1025-1026, (2010); Mohammad, Abdul Wahab, Prediction of permeate fluxes and rejections of highly concentrated salts in nanofiltration membranes, Journal of Membrane Science, 289, 1-2, pp. 40-50, (2007); Mahawer, Ketan, A modeling and experimental comparative study of a closed-loop forward osmosis-nanofiltration and standalone nanofiltration systems for fouling-prone wastewater treatment, Chemical Engineering Journal, 486, (2024); Wang, Ruoyu, Pore model for nanofiltration: History, theoretical framework, key predictions, limitations, and prospects, Journal of Membrane Science, 620, (2021); Košutić, Krešimir, On experimental parameters characterizing the reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes' active layer, Journal of Membrane Science, 282, 1-2, pp. 109-114, (2006)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","19443994; 19443986","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010284694"

By unveiling detailed N flows specifically in the food manufacturing sector (food processing, distribution, and food service), this study aims to analyse the recyclability of N losses quantitatively. Results showed approximately 60% of the total N input resulted in N loss. The N losses can be classified into highly recyclable nitrogen (high-RAN: 11%), low-recyclable nitrogen (low-RAN: 16%) and non-recyclable nitrogen (non-RAN: 73%). A comparative analysis was performed with three scenarios according to the Green Food System Strategy: a control scenario of 2050, Scenario l targeting chemical fertilizer reduction, and Scenario 2 targeting chemical fertilizer reduction and increased feed self-sufficiency. Compared to the control, both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 demonstrated improvements in N recycling efficiencies by 4.9% and 15.0%, respectively. Notably, the Scenario 2, which separately reutilised high-RAN and low-RAN, expanded the N demand for recycling, achieving a 6.4% enhanced N loss reduction compared to the Scenario 1. In conclusion, this study provides the suggestion that the sophistication of the reutilisation network can promote the reduction of N losses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Food system; Input–output analysis; Material flow analysis; Nitrogen flow; Recyclability","Agri-food; Breweries; Dairies; Packing plants; Refining; % reductions; Chemical fertilizers; Food system; Input/Output analysis; Materials flow analysis; N loss; Nitrogen flow; Nitrogen loss; Recyclability; Recyclables; Food industry","","","Funding text 1: Open Access funding provided by University of Yamanashi.; Funding text 2: We are grateful to Natsuki Matsuyama and Hiroshi Takeda for their suggestions and cooperation.

However, practical application of TEGs is constrained by the limited thermoelectric performance of traditional materials like bismuth telluride (Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf>)-based thermoelectric materials. Thick thermoelectric films frequently suffer from cracking, leading to reduced reliability and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this study investigates the incorporation of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) into Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf>-based thermoelectric films. CNF, a sustainable and biodegradable material, was hypothesized to improve thermoelectric performance by reducing thermal conductivity through enhanced phonon scattering while maintaining favorable electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. Crack-free CNF-Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf> composite films (400 μm thick) were synthesized using a pulsed electrodeposition method. Structural analysis confirmed that CNF introduced significant microstructural improvements, including grain refinement, enhanced grain boundary scattering, and optimized carrier transport pathways. At an optimal CNF concentration of 0.06 wt%, the ZT value of the composite films reached 0.76, representing a 625% improvement over the pure Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf> film. This remarkable enhancement was achieved through a significant reduction in thermal conductivity and balanced improvements in electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. These results highlight the potential of CNF as an effective additive for improving both the thermoelectric efficiency and structural integrity of Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf>-based materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bismuth telluride; cellulose nanofibers; micro-thermoelectric generator; nanocomposite; thermoelectric materials","Cellulose films; Electrochemical deposition; Grain boundaries; Nanocellulose; Nanocomposite films; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Tellurium compounds; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thick films; Waste heat utilization; Bismuth telluride; Cellulose nanofibers; Electrical conductivity; Micro-thermoelectric generator; Thermal; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermoelectric film; Thermoelectric generators; Thermoelectric material; Thermoelectric performance; Grain refinement; Bismuth; Efficiency; Grain; Materials; Performance; Scattering; Tellurium Compounds; Thermal Conductivity","","","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant No. 23K03706), the Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Area (Grant No. 24H02231), the JST/ASPIRE Program (Grant No. JPMJAP2413), and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (Grant No. JP21zf0127001).

An easily available hydraulic model can contribute to the design of urban flooding countermeasures and mitigation of urban heat islands by covering roads with pavements. Many studies have evaluated saturated hydraulic conductivity, but few studies of measurements and modeling of unsaturated hydraulic properties such as water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for roadbase materials have been done. Therefore, this study measured the unsaturated hydraulic properties of typical roadbase materials of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) using an evaporation method in the laboratory. To improve the water retention capacity, RCA blended with autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) grains were also used. The results showed that the Gardner–Campbell (GC) model described the hydraulic properties of tested roadbed materials well, and the inclusion of AAC grains increased the water-holding capacity effectively. As a case study, the GC model was incorporated into the Green–Ampt infiltration model to simulate the change in the infiltration rate over time. The simulated results analyzed the water infiltration characteristics well, and this approach would be a good tool to make a quick assessment of the infiltration process of roadbed materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC); Infiltration; Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA); Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity; Water retention","Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Concrete slabs; Hydraulic models; Infiltration; Positive temperature coefficient; Water aeration; Water recycling; Autoclaved aerated concrete; Concrete grains; Hydraulic properties; Recycled concrete aggregate; Recycled concrete aggregates; Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity; Unsaturated hydraulic properties; Water infiltration; Water retention; Hydraulic conductivity","","","This research was supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) \u2013 Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (No. JPMJSA1701).","Report on National Environment Solid Waste Hanoi Vietnam, (2011); Nguyen, Hoang Giang, Current management condition and waste composition characteristics of construction and demolition waste landfills in hanoi of vietnam, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 18, (2021); Thai, Hong Nam, Characterization of compaction and CBR properties of recycled concrete aggregates for unbound road base and subbase materials in Vietnam, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 24, 1, pp. 34-48, (2022); Pham, Van Nam, Mechanical, hydraulic, and particle breakage properties of recycled concrete aggregates blended with autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) grains for unbound road base and subbase materials in Vietnam, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 26, 2, pp. 845-859, (2024); Luo, Pingping, Flood inundation assessment for the Hanoi Central Area, Vietnam under historical and extreme rainfall conditions, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Pham, Van Nam, REVIEW OF WATER AND HEAT BALANCES AND CHALLENGES TO ADOPTION OF PERMEABLE PAVEMENT SYSTEM IN VIETNAM, International Journal of GEOMATE, 24, 103, pp. 84-95, (2023); Song, Jianying, Comparison between different infiltration models to describe the infiltration of permeable brick pavement system via a laboratory-scale experiment, Water Science and Technology, 84, 9, pp. 2214-2227, (2021); A Laboratory Scale Study of Infiltration from Pervious Pavements, (2006); Chu, Xuefeng, Determination of ponding condition and infiltration into layered soils under unsteady rainfall, Journal of Hydrology, 313, 3-4, pp. 195-207, (2005); Ma, Ying, Water infiltration in layered soils with air entrapment: Modified green-ampt model and experimental validation, Journal of Hydrologic Engineering - ASCE, 16, 8, pp. 628-638, (2011)","","Springer","","","","","","14384957; 16118227","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000428237"

Bats are known to exhibit highly diversified orofacial morphotypes within their clade, reflecting their varied diets and echolocation behaviors. The presence of bony discontinuities between the premaxilla and maxilla or among the premaxillae is a notable feature of bat orofacial morphology, observed in certain lineages. It is suggested that these unique orofacial morphotypes, not generally found in other mammals, have evolved in relation to dietary adaptations rather than merely for echolocation mode. Until now, the developmental background of the bony discontinuities in the bat orofacial complex has been insufficiently investigated. Here, we present a comparative study of the chondrocranium and epithelial organs in the orofacial complex of three bat species: Cynopterus sphinx, Rhinolophus malayanus, and Vespertilio sinensis. Our observations indicate that the preceding morphogenesis of orofacial cartilage and epithelial structures is remarkably different among these three species. In C. sphinx and V. sinensis, the region forming from the regression of the palatine process of the premaxilla was filled with orofacial cartilage and epithelial structures. We also found that the clefted morphology observed in R. malayanus and V. sinensis was formed via contrastingly divergent developmental processes. Midline clefts among Yangochiroptera have been previously categorized to represent a uniform morphotype, but our study highlights that attributing midline clefts into a singular category should be revisited, advocating for a nuanced categorization of cleft morphology based on their morphogenetic patterns. Further research on the bat orofacial complex may enhance our understanding of bat evolutionary diversification and offer insights into the developmental mechanisms of human cleft palate. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","chiroptera; craniofacial; echolocation; palate; upper jaw","isoflurane; anatomical concepts; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bat; cartilage; cleft palate; Cynopterus sphinx; echolocation; fetus; histology; immunohistochemistry; maxilla; micro-computed tomography; morphogenesis; morphology; morphotype; nonhuman; orofacial clefting; orofacial complex; phylogeny; Rhinolophus malayanus; Vespertilio sinensis; x-ray computed tomography; animal; evolution; physiology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Chiroptera; Cleft Palate","","isoflurane, 26675-46-7","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Naito Foundation, JSPS (21H02546, 21\u2009K19291, and 22KK0101), JST (JPMJFR2148) to DK, JSPS (23\u2009K14239) to FM, and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (QTHU01.01/22\u201023) to VTT.; Funding text 2: was collected by the authors in Hokkaido, Japan, under the permission granted by Shiribeshi Subprefecture Government (#268\u2013272). and were collected by VTT and DK under the permission granted by the Vietnam Administration of Forest, belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (No. 1072/TCLN\u2010BTTN and No.326/TCLN\u2010BTTN), guaranteeing compliance with local wildlife conservation laws and adhering to the highest ethical standards.

The formation of both midline and bilateral orofacial clefts in laryngeally echolocating bats, morphologically similar to the syndromic and non-syndromic cleft palate in humans, are not well understood. Developmental series of prenatal samples (n = 128) and adults (n = 10) of eight bat species (two pteropodids, four rhinolophoids, and two yangochiropterans), and two non-bat mammals (Mus musculus and Erinaceus amurensis), were CT-scanned and cranial bones forming the upper jaw complex were three-dimensionally visualised to assess whether differences in palate development can be observed across bat phylogeny. Volumetric data of bones composing the upper jaw complex were measured to quantify palate growth. The premaxilla is relatively reduced in bats compared to other mammals and its shape is heterogeneous depending on the presence and type of orofacial cleft across bat phylogeny. The palatine process of premaxillary bones is lacking in pteropodids and yangochiropterans, whereas the premaxilla is a mobile structure which is only in contact caudally with the maxilla by a fibrous membrane or suture in rhinolophoids. In all bats, maxillary bones progressively extend caudally and palatine bones, in some cases split into three branches, extend caudally so that they are completely fused to another one medially prior to the birth. Ossification of the vomer and fusion of the maxillary and palatine bones occur earlier in rhinolophoids than in pteropodids and yangochiropterans. The vomer ossifies bilaterally from two different ossification centres in yangochiropterans, which is uncommon in other bats and non-bat mammals. Analysis of ontogenetic allometric trajectories of the upper jaw complex revealed faster development of maxillary, vomer, and palatine bones in yangochiropterans compared to other bats, especially rhinolophoids. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that yangochiropterans have a higher magnitude of change in ossification rate compared to other bats and E. amurensis a lower magnitude compared to M. musculus and bats. This study provides new evidence of heterochronic shifts in craniofacial development and growth across bat phylogeny that can improve understanding of the developmental differences characterising nasal and oral emission strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chiroptera; development; evolutionary morphology; ontogenetic trajectory; skull; upper jaw bones","Article; bat; craniofacial development; echolocation; Erinaceus; flying fox; larynx; maxilla; morphology; Mus musculus; nonhuman; ossification; phylogeny; prenatal growth; animal; growth, development and aging; physiology; Animals; Chiroptera; Echolocation; Larynx; Maxilla; Phylogeny","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Naito Foundation, JSPS (21H02546, 21 K19291, and 22KK0101), JST (JPMJFR2148) to DK, and from the Australian Research Council to LABW (FT200100822).

This study presents Dense Multiscale Sample Entropy (DM-SamEn) as an innovative method for diminishing feature dimensions while maintaining the uniqueness of signal features. DM-SamEn employs a weighting mechanism that considers the dynamic properties of the signal, thereby reducing redundancy and improving the distinctiveness of features extracted from vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) signals in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Subsequent to the extraction process, correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and sequential backward selection (SBS) refine feature sets, improving algorithmic accuracy. To validate the feature extraction and selection stage, three classifiers—Adaptive Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (AW-KNN), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—were employed to evaluate classification efficacy and ascertain optimal performance across selection strategies, including CFS, SBS, and the hybrid SBS-CFS approach. K-fold cross-validation was employed to provide improved evaluation of model performance by assessing the model on various data subsets, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting and augmenting the robustness of the results. As a result, the model demonstrated a significant ability to differentiate between PD patients and healthy controls, with classification accuracy reported as ACC [CI 95%: 97.82–98.5%] for disease identification and ACC [CI 95%: 96.3–97.3%] for severity assessment. Optimal performance was primarily achieved through feature sets chosen using SBS and the integrated SBS-CFS methods. The findings highlight the model’s potential as an effective instrument for diagnosing PD and assessing its severity, contributing to advancements in clinical management of the condition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dense multiscale sample entropy; feature selection process; feature selection strategy; machine learning; Parkinson’s Disease detection","Image coding; Microdissection; Nearest neighbor search; Redundancy; Risk assessment; Support vector machines; Dense multiscale sample entropy; Disease detection; Feature selection process; Feature selection strategy; Features selection; Features sets; Machine-learning; Parkinson’s disease detection; Sample entropy; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","This work was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under Strategic Basic Research Programs Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) under Grant JPMJPR20M6.","Schalkamp, Ann Kathrin, Wearable movement-tracking data identify Parkinson’s disease years before clinical diagnosis, Nature Medicine, 29, 8, pp. 2048-2056, (2023); Telarovič, Srdana, Epidemiology of Parkinson’s Disease, Archives of Psychiatry Research, 59, 1, pp. 147-148, (2023); Pagano, Gaetano, Rehabilitation Outcome in Patients undergone Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery using Inertial Technology for Gait Analysis, (2020); Aşuroğlu, Tunç, A deep learning approach for parkinson’s disease severity assessment, Health and Technology, 12, 5, pp. 943-953, (2022); Zhao, Aite, A hybrid spatio-temporal model for detection and severity rating of Parkinson's disease from gait data, Neurocomputing, 315, pp. 1-8, (2018); Arxiv, (2019); Xv Multidisciplinary International Congress on Science and Technology Pp 318 Springer, (2020); Faisal, Md Ahasan Atick, NDDNet: a deep learning model for predicting neurodegenerative diseases from gait pattern, Applied Intelligence, 53, 17, pp. 20034-20046, (2023); Goldberger, Ary L., PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals., Circulation, 101, 23, pp. E215-220, (2000); Yogev-Seligmann, Galit, Dual tasking, gait rhythmicity, and Parkinson's disease: Which aspects of gait are attention demanding?, European Journal of Neuroscience, 22, 5, pp. 1248-1256, (2005)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215756314"

We have investigated the use of AI to provide the original authentic image after deepfake detection, which we believe is a reliable and persuasive solution. We call this “image-based automated fact verification,” a name that originated from a text-based fact-checking system used by journalists. We have developed a two-phase open framework that integrates detection and retrieval components. Additionally, inspired by a dataset proposed by Meta Fundamental AI Research, we further constructed a large-scale dataset that is specifically designed for this task. This dataset simulates real-world conditions and includes both content-preserving and content-aware manipulations that present a range of difficulty levels and have potential for ongoing research. This multi-task dataset is fully annotated, enabling it to be utilized for sub-tasks within the forgery identification and fact retrieval domains. This paper makes two main contributions: 1) We introduce a new task, ‘‘image-based automated fact verification,” and present a novel two-phase open framework combining “forgery identification” and “fact retrieval.” 2) We present a large-scale dataset tailored for this new task that features various hand-crafted image edits and machine learning-driven manipulations, with extensive annotations suitable for various sub-tasks. Extensive experimental results validate its practicality for fact verification research and clarify its difficulty levels for various sub-tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Datasets; fact verification; forgery detection; image copy detection; neural networks","Image processing; Large datasets; Learning systems; Dataset; Fact verification; Forgery detections; Image copy detection; Image-based; Multi tasks; Neural-networks; Open frameworks; Subtask; Two phase; Neural networks","","","This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI under Grant JP21H04907 and Grant JP24H00732, in part by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) including AIP Challenge Program under Grant JPMJCR20D3, in part by JST Advanced Integrated Intelligence Platform (AIP) Acceleration under Grant JPMJCR24U3, and in part by JST K Program Japan under Grant JPMJKP24C2.","Faceapp Face Editor Makeover and Beauty App, (2016); Reface Be Anyone, (2020); Kim, Hyeongwoo, Deep video portraits, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 37, 4, (2018); Tackling the Misinformation Epidemic within Event of Moon Disaster, (2020); Zakharov, Egor, Few-shot adversarial learning of realistic neural talking head models, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 9458-9467, (2019); Li, Lingzhi, Face X-ray for more general face forgery detection, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5000-5009, (2020); Masi, Iacopo, Two-Branch Recurrent Network for Isolating Deepfakes in Videos, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12352 LNCS, pp. 667-684, (2020); Matern, Falko, Exploiting visual artifacts to expose deepfakes and face manipulations, pp. 83-92, (2019); Qian, Yuyang, Thinking in Frequency: Face Forgery Detection by Mining Frequency-Aware Clues, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12357 LNCS, pp. 86-103, (2020); Wu, Xi, SSTNet: Detecting Manipulated Faces Through Spatial, Steganalysis and Temporal Features, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2020-May, pp. 2952-2956, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010149918"

However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision—language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide’s regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient—distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual—learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cancer subtyping; continual learning; gradient distillation; Lifelong learning; whole slide image analysis","Computer aided diagnosis; Diseases; E-learning; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Tissue; WSI circuits; Cancer diagnosis; Cancer subtyping; Continual learning; Gradient distillation; Image analyze; Image-analysis; Life long learning; Subtypings; Whole slide image analyze; Whole slide images; Distillation","","","This work was supported in part by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)-Advanced Technologies for CArbon-Neutral (ALCA-Next)-Next Program, Japan, under Grant JPMJAN23F4; in part by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), Japan, under Grant 22H00515; in part by the 2025 Priority Strategic Funds Promotion of Open Access Publication of Scholarly Articles; and in part by the Next Generation Researchers Challenging Research Program under Grant zk25010020.","Wu, Shaoxu, Artificial intelligence-based model for lymph node metastases detection on whole slide images in bladder cancer: a retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study, The Lancet Oncology, 24, 4, pp. 360-370, (2023); Cureus, (2023); Jahanifar, Mostafa, Domain Generalization in Computational Pathology: Survey and Guidelines, ACM Computing Surveys, 57, 11, (2025); International Conference on Machine Learning, (2019); Huang, Yanyan, ConSlide: Asynchronous Hierarchical Interaction Transformer with Breakup-Reorganize Rehearsal for Continual Whole Slide Image Analysis, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 21292-21303, (2023); Li, Zhizhong, Learning without Forgetting, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40, 12, pp. 2935-2947, (2018); Kirkpatrick, James, Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 114, 13, pp. 3521-3526, (2017); Zhu, Xinyu, Lifelong Histopathology Whole Slide Image Retrieval via Distance Consistency Rehearsal, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 15004 LNCS, pp. 274-284, (2024); New Insights on Reducing Abrupt Representation Change in Online Continual Learning, (2021); Efficient Lifelong Learning with A Gem, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008684609"

Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is one of the most dangerous diseases affecting cassava production in Africa. Since the first reported in Southeast Asia in 2015, the CMD prevalence has become a concern in Southeast Asia. To combat it, CMD resistance has been introduced from African cassava into Asian elite cultivars. However, efficient DNA markers for the selection of CMD resistance are not available. The CMD2 locus confers resistance to African cassava mosaic virus via non-synonymous substitutions in the DNA polymerase δ subunit 1 gene (MePOLD1). Here, we developed DNA markers to identify the mutations providing the resistance. We examined the association between the resistance score in CMD-infected fields and the genotypes of hybrids of CMD-resistant and -susceptible Asian lines. Our study provides powerful tools to the global cassava breeding community for selecting CMD resistant cassava. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cassava; cassava mosaic disease; CMD2; marker-assisted selection; MePOLD1","","","","This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21KK0110, the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) in a collaboration between the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Freshwater Lymnaea snails serve as intermediate hosts, contributing to the increasing prevalence of fascioliasis in cattle in coastal areas. The salinity tolerance of Lymnaea snails was investigated along with their distribution and Fasciola infection rates in both snails and grazing cattle in Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, and Soc Trang provinces in Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where seawater reversely enters into the paddy field during the dry season. Lymnaea snails were collected from 53 communes across the three provinces and analyzed for Fasciola larval infections. Additionally, cattle fecal samples were examined for the presence of Fasciola eggs. The salinity levels in the study areas ranged from 0.03% to 1.90%. In total, 1,152 Lymnaea snails including L. viridis and L. rubiginosa were collected. The maximum salinity levels of L. viridis and L. rubiginosa habitats were 0.64% and 0.74%, respectively. The Fasciola infection rates of L. viridis were 2.0% in low-salinity areas and 3.7% in high-salinity areas, whereas no L. rubiginosa infections were detected in either salinity area. The prevalence of cattle fascioliasis in high-salinity areas (35.7%) was similar to low-salinity areas (32.9%). This study is the first to demonstrate that L. viridis can thrive and sustain Fasciola transmission under high-salinity conditions, suggesting the salinity tolerance of these intermediate host snails as a key factor contributing to the expansion of fascioliasis in high-salinity coastal areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cattle; Fasciola; high-salinity coastal area; Lymnaea snails; Mekong Delta Vietnam","internal transcribed spacer 1; internal transcribed spacer 2; Article; Austropeplea viridis; bovine; cercaria; dry season; Fasciola; fascioliasis; Galba truncatula; health economics; human; infection rate; lepisanthes rubiginosa; lepisanthes viridis; livestock; lymnaea snail; paddy field; Paragonimus westermani; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; reliability; salinity; salt tolerance; seashore; sedimentation; sequence analysis; temperature; Viet Nam; animal; cattle disease; epidemiology; feces; Lymnaea; parasitology; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Fascioliasis; Feces; Prevalence; Salinity; Vietnam","","","The Japan Science and Technology Agency partially supported this research under the Fostering Advanced Human Resources to Lead Green Transformation project at the University of Tokyo (grant number: JPMJSP2108).","J Anim Sci Adv, (2013); Andrews, Stuart J., The Discovery of Fasciola hepatica and its Life Cycle, pp. 1-22, (2021); Zool Jb Physiol, (1991); Charoenchai, Apirom, Natural infection of trematodes in Lymnaea (Radix) Auricularia rubiginosa in water reservoirs in Amphoe Muang, Khon Kaen Province, Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health, 28 SUPPL. 1, pp. 209-212, (1997); Correa, Ana Cristina, Morphological and molecular characterization of Neotropic Lymnaeidae (Gastropoda: Lymnaeoidea), vectors of fasciolosis, Infection, Genetics and Evolution, 11, 8, pp. 1978-1988, (2011); Saltwater Intrusion Forecast Bulletin Ben Tre Province Area, (2024); Vietnam, (1980); J Vet Sci Tech, (2006); J Biol, (2012); Bui, Dungthi, Morphological and molecular characterization of lymnaeid snails and their potential role in transmission of Fasciola spp. in Vietnam, Korean Journal of Parasitology, 51, 6, pp. 657-662, (2013)","","Japanese Society of Veterinary Science","","","","","","09167250; 13477439","","","39880610","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000106749"

Therefore, we investigated mechanisms underlying PHA production from non-edible resources by Piscinibacter gummiphilus strain NS21T. Strain NS21T can utilize natural rubber as a carbon source on solid media and potentially produces PHA. Gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of NS21T cell extracts revealed the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) from natural rubber and glucose, respectively. Transcriptional analysis suggested that phaC is involved in PHA production. An increased PHBV accumulation rate under nitrogen-limiting conditions indicates the potential of this strain to be used as a PHBV production enhancement strategy. Furthermore, the disruption of PHA depolymerase genes resulted in enhanced PHA production, indicating the involvement of these genes in PHA degradation.

This study aimed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in surface water in Vietnam over two years. One-step quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays were employed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 and its variant-specific mutation sites (G339D/E484A) and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) from a total of 315 samples (105 samples per site) to compare with reported Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and environmental factors. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 38 % (40/105), 43 % (45/105), and 39 % (41/105) of water samples from Sites A, B, and C, respectively, with concentrations of 3.0–5.6 log<inf>10</inf> copies/L. PMMoV concentrations were 5.1–8.9 log<inf>10</inf> copies/L. SARS-CoV-2 levels were higher in winter compared with summer. There was a strong positive association between the mutant type and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations (Spearman's rho = 0.77, p < 0.01). The mean concentrations of mutant and nonmutant types were 2.3 and 1.8 log<inf>10</inf> copies/L, respectively. Peaks in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations preceded reported COVID-19 cases by 2–4 weeks, with the highest association observed at a 4-week delay (Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.46–0.53). Environmental factors, including temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity, correlated negatively with SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman's rho = −0.21, −0.28, and −0.21, respectively, p < 0.05), whereas average rainfall, humidity, and dissolved oxygen correlated positively (Spearman's rho = 0.20, 0.27, and 0.51, respectively, p < 0.05). These correlations highlight the significance of environmental variables in understanding viral prevalence in water. Our findings confirmed the utility of WBE as an early warning system for long-term monitoring.

Sampling was conducted according to the US.EPA Method TO-11A, from 2012 to 2016 in both the dry and the rainy seasons at twelve sites. The result shows that the carbonyl mixing ratios are high when compared to typical cities. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone are the most abundant carbonyls together accounting for 89% of the measured carbonyls. The carbonyl mixing ratio in rainy (46.0 ± 32.2 ppb) is about twofold higher than that in dry (23.7 ± 10.3 ppb). An inverse distance weighting method was adopted to map the spatial distribution of carbonyls across the city. The result shows that the carbonyl levels tended to be high in the city center. Three carbonyl sources are resolved by the PCA/APCS method: industrial sources and solvent usage (54%), vehicle exhausts (24%), cooking emissions (11%). Both lifetime cancer risk (LCR) and non-cancer hazard index (HIs) were calculated to estimate the health impacts on the community due to inhalation exposure to current carbonyl levels. The LCR values vary from 5.31 × 10−6 to 5.75 × 10−5 for formaldehyde higher than those of 6.61 × 10−7 to 1.36 × 10−5 for acetaldehyde, which mostly exceeded the US.EPA recommendation for five age groups. The hazard quotient values are 12.0 to 68.4 for acrolein, 0.44 to 2.84 for acetaldehyde, 0.55 to 1.85 for formaldehyde, and 0.13 to 0.89 for propionaldehyde. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbonyls; Exposure assessment; Formaldehyde; Health risk; PCA/APCS","Acetaldehyde; Acetone; Formaldehyde; Health risks; Holmium compounds; Risk perception; 'Dry' [; Atmospheric carbonyls; Cancer risk; Exposure assessment; Health impact; Health risk assessments; Mixing ratios; PCA/APCS; Sources appointments; [carbonyl; Risk assessment; acetaldehyde; acetone; acrolein; carbon monoxide; carbonyl derivative; carcinogen; crotonaldehyde; formaldehyde; ozone; propionaldehyde; cancer; carbonyl compound; exhaust emission; hazard assessment; health risk; industrial emission; mixing; principal component analysis; risk assessment; source apportionment; spatial distribution; spatial variation; temporal variation; absolute principal component score; air pollution; Article; cluster analysis; correlation analysis; health risk assessment; human; life expectancy; particulate matter; photolysis; population density; quality control; seasonal variation; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; thermal pollution; tropics; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; inhalational exposure; procedures; Viet Nam; Ho Chi Minh City; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Risk Assessment; Vehicle Emissions; Vietnam","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; acetone, 67-64-1; acrolein, 107-02-8; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; crotonaldehyde, 4170-30-3; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; ozone, 10028-15-6; propionaldehyde, 123-38-6; Acetaldehyde; Acetone; Air Pollutants; Formaldehyde; Vehicle Emissions","This research was partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS project entitled \u201CMulti-Beneficial Measure for Mitigation of Climate Change in Vietnam and Indochina Countries by Development of Biomass Energy\u201D).

The composite consisted of a photoconductive polymer of poly((4-diphenylamino)benzyl acrylate), a photoconductive plasticizer of (4-diphenylamino)phenyl)methanol, a sensitizer of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, and a nonlinear optical dye of (4-(azepan-1-yl)-benzylidene)malononitrile. The photorefractive properties and related quantities were dependent on the composition, which was related to the glass transition temperature of the photorefractive polymers. The quantum efficiency (QE) of photocarrier generation was evaluated from the initial slope of the transient photocurrent. Transient photocurrents were measured and showed two unique peaks: one in the range of 10−4 to 10−3 s and the other in the range of 10−1 to 1 s. The transient photocurrents was well simulated (or reproduced) by the expanded two-trapping site model with two kinds of photocarrier generation and recombination processes and two different trapping sites. The obtained photorefractive quantity of trap density was significantly related to the photoconductive parameters of QE. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric energy transfer; Diffraction efficiency; Photorefractive properties; Response time; Transient photocurrent; Two beam coupling","acrylic acid; butyric acid; dye; malononitrile; methanol; plasticizer; polymer; article; controlled study; diffraction; energy transfer; female; genetic recombination; glass transition temperature; nonhuman; reaction time; sensitization; simulation","","acrylic acid, 10344-93-1, 79-10-7; butyric acid, 107-92-6, 156-54-7, 461-55-2; malononitrile, 109-77-3; methanol, 67-56-1","This work is supported by the Strategic Promotion of Innovative Research and Development (S-Innovation) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and is partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant no.

In periodontitis, the most prevalent infectious disease in humans, immune cells accumulate in the oral mucosa and promote bone destruction by inducing receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteogenic cells such as osteoblasts and periodontal ligament cells. However, the detailed mechanism underlying immune–bone cell interactions in periodontitis is not fully understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis on mouse periodontal lesions and showed that neutrophil–osteogenic cell crosstalk is involved in periodontitis-induced bone loss. The periodontal lesions displayed marked infiltration of neutrophils, and in silico analyses suggested that the neutrophils interacted with osteogenic cells through cytokine production. Among the cytokines expressed in the periodontal neutrophils, oncostatin M (OSM) potently induced RANKL expression in the primary osteoblasts, and deletion of the OSM receptor in osteogenic cells significantly ameliorated periodontitis-induced bone loss. Epigenomic data analyses identified the OSM-regulated RANKL enhancer region in osteogenic cells, and mice lacking this enhancer showed decreased periodontal bone loss while maintaining physiological bone metabolism. These findings shed light on the role of neutrophils in bone regulation during bacterial infection, highlighting the novel mechanism underlying osteoimmune crosstalk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","oncostatin M; osteoclast differentiation factor; alveolar bone loss; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; bone cell; bone destruction; bone mass; bone metabolism; cell interaction; computer model; controlled study; cytokine production; enhancer region; etiology; human; immunocompetent cell; male; mouse; mouth mucosa; neutrophil; nonhuman; osteoblast; osteolysis; periodontal ligament; periodontitis; single cell RNA seq; stroma cell; Alveolar Bone Loss; Animals; Cytokines; Humans; Mice; Neutrophils; Osteogenesis; Periodontitis; RANK Ligand","","oncostatin M, 106956-32-5; osteoclast differentiation factor, 200145-93-3; Cytokines; RANK Ligand","We thank S.

The cartilage and muscles comprising the hyolarynx of laryngeally echolocating bats are morphologically modified compared to those of non-bat mammals, as represented by the hypertrophied intrinsic laryngeal muscle. Despite its crucial contribution to laryngeal echolocation, how the development of the hyolarynx in bats differs from that of other mammals is poorly documented. The genus Rhinolophus is one of the most sophisticated laryngeal echolocators, with the highest pulse frequency in bats. The present study provides the first detailed description of the three-dimensional anatomy and development of the skeleton, cartilage, muscle, and innervation patterns of the hyolaryngeal apparatus in two species of rhinolophid bats using micro-computed tomography images and serial tissue sections and compares them with those of laboratory mice. Furthermore, we measured the peak frequency of the echolocation pulse in active juvenile and adult individuals to correspond to echolocation pulses with hyolaryngeal morphology at each postnatal stage. Results: We found that the sagittal crests of the cricoid cartilage separated the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle in horseshoe bats, indicating that this unique morphology may be required to reinforce the repeated closure movement of the glottis during biosonar pulse emission. We also found that the cricothyroid muscle is ventrally hypertrophied throughout ontogeny, and that the cranial laryngeal nerve has a novel branch supplying the hypertrophied region of this muscle. Our bioacoustic analyses revealed that the peak frequency shows negative allometry against skull growth, and that the volumetric growth of all laryngeal cartilages is correlated with the pulse peak frequency. Conclusions: The unique patterns of muscle and innervation revealed in this study appear to have been obtained concomitantly with the acquisition of tracheal chambers in rhinolophids and hipposiderids, improving sound intensity during laryngeal echolocation. In addition, significant protrusion of the sagittal crest of the cricoid cartilage and the separated dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle may contribute to the sophisticated biosonar in this laryngeally echolocating lineage. Furthermore, our bioacoustic data suggested that the mineralization of these cartilages underpins the ontogeny of echolocation pulse generation. The results of the present study provide crucial insights into how the anatomy and development of the hyolaryngeal apparatus shape the acoustic diversity in bats. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bats; Bioacoustics; Hyolarynx; Laryngeal echolocation; Trachea","","","","Funding text 1: JSPS (19J20608, 22J00127, and 23K14255) to N.

The fetal and postnatal specimens of R. pusillus were collected by the authors in Japan and Vietnam. Rhinolophus pusillus from Japan was collected under the permission granted by the Gosen Local Government in Japan (No. 1–4-2021) and is stored at the University of Tsukuba (UT). The fetal specimens of R. malayanus were collected by the authors during field sampling in Vietnam under permission granted by the An Giang Province People’s Committee in Vietnam (No. 497/VPUBND-NC and No. 5893/VPUBND-KTN) and the Vietnam Administration of Forest, belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (No. 1072/TCLN-BTTN and No.326/TCLN-BTTN). Rhinolophus pusillus from Japan and Vietnam are considered to compose a single species, and geographic variation of the hyolaryngeal morphology was not detected between individuals from Japan and those from Vietnam. Our postnatal samples of R. pusillus comprehensively covered the overall ontogeny of the echolocation pulse, but some stages of prenatal specimens were lacking to describe the ossification sequence of the hyolaryngeal bony components. Therefore, fetal specimens of R. malayanus, both of which are members of the same genus Rhinolophus [], were additionally included. The examined specimens of R. pusillus and R. malayanus were first confirmed to show no significant difference in qualitative hyolaryngeal morphology. Animal ethics for mice sampling and experiments were approved at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan (A2019-060C3 and A2021-198A). All experiments were conducted following the ARRIVE guidelines following the Japanese law on animal welfare. All pregnant individuals captured in this study were euthanized by isoflurane inhalation. Fetal bat specimens were staged following Cretekos Stage (CS) []. The postnatal stage of bats was estimated by the time when the first birth was observed in the reproductive colony. The details of all specimens are summarized in Table . Fetal specimens examined in this study include stages from CS16 to CS24 (R. pusillus: CS16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24; R. malayanus: CS18, 20.5, 22). Postnatal specimens, all of which were R. pusillus, covered postnatal day 0, 14, 21, 30, 45, and adult. One adult individual of R. pusillus was loaned from the curatorial collection held in Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History (KPMNH), and all samples of R. malayanus from the curatorial collection held in the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology (IEBR). All mouse fetuses from E14.5 to E18.5 and postnatal specimens from P0 to adult (n = 10) were collected at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU). Pregnant mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The collected specimens were fixed using a mixture of ethyl alcohol:acetic acid:formalin (6:3:1) and stored in 70% ethyl alcohol.

To address this issue, this study explores the source apportionment of PM<inf>2.5</inf> by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and identifies potential regional sources through the weighted concentration-weighted trajectory (WCWT) model based on the field observation data of PM<inf>2.5</inf> in HCMC. 24-h PM<inf>2.5</inf> samples were collected in central HCMC for a year (September 2019–August 2020). Herein, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy was used to analyze trace elements, in addition to identifying PM<inf>2.5</inf> mass and other chemical species, such as water-soluble ions and carbonaceous species, reported in our former study. The PMF results showed that PM<inf>2.5</inf> in HCMC was dominated by anthropogenic-rich sources comprising biomass burning, coal combustion, transportation, and crustal origins (36.4% of PM<inf>2.5</inf> mass), followed by secondary ammonium sulfate (18.4%), sea salt (13.7%), road dust (9.6%), and coal and crude oil combustion (9.4%). WCWT results suggested that the geological sources of PM<inf>2.5</inf> were mainly from local areas and scattered to the northeast/southwest of HCMC. In addition, the long-range transport of PM<inf>2.5</inf> from surrounding countries was revealed during the assembly restriction and lockdown period in 2020.

Regular monitoring and vaccine efficacy of HAV are still lacking in different countries. This study aimed to investigate HAV and HEV prevalence in developed, developing, and least-developed Asian countries using wastewater as a surveillance tool. A total of 232 untreated wastewater samples were collected from six wastewater treatment plants, a sewage treatment plant, or an open drainage in six countries [Nepal (n = 51), Indonesia (n = 37), Thailand (n = 30), Vietnam (n = 27), the Philippines (n = 17), and Japan (n = 70)] between April and October 2022. Viruses in wastewater were concentrated by simple centrifugation or polyethylene glycol precipitation method, followed by viral RNA extraction and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HAV and HEV RNA were detected in the samples from Nepal (51 % for HAV and 2 % for HEV), Thailand (3 % for both viruses), and Japan (1 % for HAV and 24 % for HEV). Only HAV RNA was found in 11 % of the samples in Indonesia, whereas only HEV RNA was detected in Vietnam and the Philippines, with a positive ratio of 15 % and 12 %, respectively. These results highlighted the geographic variability in HAV and HEV prevalence, underscoring the need for localized public health strategies to address specific viral hepatitis challenges in each country. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian country; Hepatitis A virus; Hepatitis E virus; Wastewater-based epidemiology","Sewage aeration; Sewage treatment plants; Vaccines; Asian countries; Global health; Health concerns; Hepatitis A virus; Hepatitis E Virus; Indonesia; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam; Wastewater-based epidemiology; Wastewater treatment; disease prevalence; epidemiology; hepatitis; public health; virus; wastewater; Article; Asian; controlled study; DNA extraction; drug industry; hepatitis A; hepatitis E; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; quality control; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; scientific literature; vaccination; virus detection; Asia; genetics; Hepatitis E virus; isolation and purification; Japan; Nepal; virology; virus RNA; Hepatitis A; Hepatitis E; Prevalence; RNA, Viral; Vietnam; Wastewater","","RNA, Viral; Wastewater","This study was supported by the Hitachi Global Foundation through the Hitachi Fund Support for Research Related to Infectious Diseases, the Japan Science and Technology Agency through the e-ASIA Joint Research Program (grant no.

Using a GIS-based Analytic Hierarchy Process with multi-criteria decision-making (AHP-MCDM), this research integrates stakeholders’ opinions, environmental considerations, and technical factors to assess land suitability for wind energy development. The analysis reveals that Jamaica has the potential to increase its wind power output by 8.99% compared to the current production of 99 MW. This expansion could significantly contribute to offsetting fossil fuel-based energy consumption and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It identifies sites across several parishes, including Westmoreland, Clarendon, St. Mary, and St. James, as highly suitable for utility-scale wind farm development. By providing detailed spatial information and estimated energy outputs, this research offers valuable insights for energy planners, investors, and policymakers to create sustainable energy policies and advance Jamaica’s 50% renewable energy goal by 2030. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbon dioxide emission reduction; environmental evaluation; geographic information system (GIS); multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM); spatial energy systems planning","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; decision making; emission control; GIS; multicriteria analysis; policy making; spatial planning; wind farm; wind power; Jamaica","","","Funding text 1: The primary author thanks Helmut Yabar and Takeshi Mizunoya, who made the research possible.

We used data from 25,357 subjects for examination-based analyses and those from 53,042 subjects for questionnaire-based analyses in the Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort study. Metabolic phenotypes were defined by classifying subjects according to their body mass index (BMI; obesity: BMI ≥25 kg/m2; normal weight: BMI <25 kg/m2) and the number of metabolic abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities were defined according to metabolic syndrome components of the Joint Interim Statement criteria for examination-based analyses and self-reported histories of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for questionnaire-based analyses. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders were performed for total and site-specific cancer incidence rates according to metabolic phenotypes. Metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) was significantly associated with cancer incidence in both examination-based [HR (95% confidence interval), 1.17 (1.01–1.36)] and questionnaire-based analyses [HR (95% confidence interval), 1.15 (1.04–1.26)]. Regarding site-specific cancer in questionnaire-based analyses, metabolically healthy obesity and MUHO were associated with colorectum and liver cancers in all subjects and with breast cancer in female subjects. Subjects with a metabolically unhealthy normal weight had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer. Moreover, MUHO was associated with corpus uteri cancer in female subjects. This prospective cohort study suggests that metabolic phenotypes are important risk factors for total and some site-specific cancers in Japanese adults. Significance: The prospective cohort study in a large Japanese population suggested that metabolic phenotypes are important risk factors for total and some site-specific cancers in Japanese adults. Moreover, the risk of each site-specific cancer may differ according to metabolic phenotypes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; aged; clinical trial; cohort analysis; epidemiology; female; genetics; human; Japan; male; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; neoplasm; phenotype; prospective study; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Phenotype; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors","","","We thank all the contributors to the J-MICC study who are listed at supplementary file and the following site (as of August 2024): https://jmicc.com/ en/contributors.

However, the debate about the evolutionary origin of laryngeal echolocation in bats remains unresolved. The morphology of the larynx is known to reflect vocal adaptation and thus can potentially help in resolving this controversy. However, the morphological variations of the larynx are poorly known in bats, and a complete anatomical study remains to be conducted. Here, we compare the 3D laryngeal morphology of 23 extant bat species of 11 different families reconstructed by using iodine contrast-enhanced X-ray microtomography techniques. We find that, contrary to previously thought, laryngeal muscle hypertrophy is not a characteristic of all bats and presents differential development. The larynges of Pteropodidae are morphologically similar to those of non-bat mammals. Two morphotypes are described among laryngeal echolocating bats, illustrating morphological differences between Rhinolophoidea and Yangochiroptera, with the main variations being the cricothyroid muscle volume and the shape of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. For the first time we detail functional specialization for constant frequency echolocation among Rhinolophoidea. Lastly, the nasal-emitting taxa representing a polyphyletic group do not share the same laryngeal form, which raises questions about the potential modular nature of the bat larynx. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chiroptera; cricothyroid muscle; functional adaptation; larynx; mammalian nasopharyngeal morphology; vocal tract; X-ray microtomography","","","","Funding text 1: We thank Cody W.

However, the unpredictable and intermittent nature of available resources poses challenges for optimal MG scheduling. Hybrid AC–DC microgrids provide a solution, seamlessly integrating renewables while reducing energy losses and improving power grid reliability. Additionally, incentive-based demand response programs promote flexible energy consumption, further mitigating the variability of renewable generation and enhancing grid stability. This paper investigates the challenges and potential of high renewable penetration in hybrid AC–DC MGs, analysing the role of demand response programs in system optimization. The microgrid's energy management is modelled using MILP, while a Stackelberg game represents the demand response program. These models are integrated to optimize energy management and demand response jointly. Simulations demonstrate the cost-saving benefits of this integrated framework, achieved through coordinated flexible resource scheduling and incentive-based demand response programming. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","demand side management; energy management systems; micro grids; renewable energy sources","Clean energy; Demand side management; Hybrid power; Demand response programs; Demand-side; Energy; Environmental benefits; Incentive-based demand response; Management systems; Microgrid; Renewable energy source; Renewables; Use of renewable energies; Demand response","","","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), the third period of Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) \u201CSmart Energy Management System\u201D.

The mechanisms of wear, adhesion, and heat generation leading to seizure at the mesoscale were modelized without assumptions or theories based on empirical rules. In particular, we targeted on flash temperature during seizure process, which is difficult to measure directly in experiment and has not been simulated without using friction theory. Our model consisted of both a macroscopic elastoplastic consideration and a microscopic interfacial interaction consideration, and the heat generation scheme that 90% of the plastic strain energy is converted to heat energy were adopted in the model. The simulation demonstrated the seizure process in which the contact state is maintained by the strong interfacial interaction as the plastic strain progresses and the temperature rapidly rises. The flash temperature by the simulation provided a reasonable quantitative match at order level to a temperature estimated by substituting true contact area and interfacial heat flux obtained by the simulation into a theoretical formula of flash temperature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boundary lubrication; Flash temperature; Mesoscale; Seizure; Smoodthed Particle Hydrodynamics simulation","Boundary lubrications; Flash temperatures; Hydrodynamic simulation; Interfacial interaction; Meso scale; Particle hydrodynamics; Seizure; Seizure temperature; Smoodthed particle hydrodynamic simulation; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics","","","This work was primarily supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number JP20K04245, titled \u201CModel Development of mesoscale simulation on friction and wear of Boundary lubrication\u201D.

MMT and MMTP change over time; however, the changing directions show region-wide heterogeneity. We examined the heterogeneity of temporal changes in MMT and MMTP across multiple communities and in multiple countries. Methods: Daily time-series data for mortality and ambient mean temperature for 699 communities in 34 countries spanning 1986–2015 were analyzed using a two-stage meta-analysis. First, a quasi-Poisson regression was employed to estimate MMT and MMTP for each community during the designated subperiods. Second, we pooled the community-specific temporally varying estimates using mixed-effects meta-regressions to examine temporal changes in MMT and MMTP in the entire study population, as well as by climate zone, geographical region, and country. Results: Temporal increases in MMT and MMTP from 19.5 °C (17.9, 21.1) to 20.3 °C (18.5, 22.0) and from the 74.5 (68.3, 80.6) to 75.0 (71.0, 78.9) percentiles in the entire population were found, respectively. Temporal change was significantly heterogeneous across geographical regions (P < 0.001). Temporal increases in MMT were observed in East Asia (linear slope [LS] = 0.91, P = 0.02) and South-East Asia (LS = 0.62, P = 0.05), whereas a temporal decrease in MMT was observed in South Europe (LS = −0.46, P = 0.05). MMTP decreased temporally in North Europe (LS = −3.45, P = 0.02) and South Europe (LS = −2.86, P = 0.05). Conclusions: The temporal change in MMT or MMTP was largely heterogeneous. Population susceptibility in terms of optimum temperature may have changed under a warming climate, albeit with large region-dependent variations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate change; Heterogeneity; Human adaptation; Minimum mortality temperature; Temporal change","adaptation; Article; climate; climate change; environmental temperature; Europe; Far East; human; ICD-10; ICD-9; major clinical study; Monte Carlo method; mortality; observational study; Southeast Asia; temperature; time series analysis","","","D.Y. was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2022M3J6A1084843).

L-Proline (Pro) is one such osmolyte that is also being used as a feed stimulant in the aquaculture industry. Halomonas elongata OUT30018 is a moderately halophilic bacterium that accumulates ectoine (Ect), but not Pro, as an osmolyte. Due to its ability to utilize diverse biomass-derived carbon and nitrogen sources for growth, H. elongata OUT30018 is used in this work to create a strain that overproduces Pro, which could be used as a sustainable Pro-rich feed additive. To achieve this, we replaced the coding region of H. elongata OUT30018’s Ect biosynthetic operon with the artificial self-cloned proB<inf>m1</inf>AC gene cluster that encodes the Pro biosynthetic enzymes: feedback-inhibition insensitive mutant γ-glutamate kinase (γ-GKD118N/D119N), γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase, and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. Additionally, the putA gene, which encodes the key enzyme of Pro catabolism, was deleted from the genome to generate H. elongata HN6. While the Ect-deficient H. elongata KA1 could not grow in minimal media containing more than 4% NaCl, H. elongata HN6 thrived in the medium containing 8% NaCl by accumulating Pro in the cell instead of Ect, reaching a concentration of 353.1 ± 40.5 µmol/g cell fresh weight, comparable to the Ect accumulated in H. elongata OUT30018 in response to salt stress. With its genetic background, H. elongata HN6 has the potential to be developed into a Pro-rich cell factory for upcycling biomass waste into single-cell feed additives, contributing to a more sustainable aquaculture industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","aquaculture industry; Halomonas elongata; high salinity; metabolic engineering; osmolyte; proline biosynthesis; self-cloning","Bacteria; Clone cells; Enzymes; Gene encoding; Temperature scales; Aquaculture industry; Ectoine; Feed additives; Halomonas elongata; Halophilic bacteria; High salinity; L-proline; Osmolytes; Proline biosynthesis; Self-cloning; Metabolic engineering; aquaculture industry; bacterium; biomass; enzyme activity; gene expression; genome; salinity; stress; tolerance; bacterial protein; diamino acid; ectoine; inositol; proline; genetics; Halomonas; metabolic engineering; metabolism; salt stress; salt tolerance; Amino Acids, Diamino; Bacterial Proteins; Inositol; Metabolic Engineering; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Proline; Salinity; Salt Stress; Salt Tolerance","","ectoine, 96702-03-3; inositol, 55608-27-0, 6917-35-7, 87-89-8; proline, 147-85-3, 7005-20-1; Amino Acids, Diamino; Bacterial Proteins; ectoine; Inositol; Proline","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 19K12400 and 22K12446, JST grant number JPMJPF2117, and IFO grant number LA-2022-035.

This study investigated the effect of miR-27a-5p on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-stimulated hDPCs showed concurrent increases in the expression of miR-27a-5p and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1), and the increased expression was suppressed by NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-0785. Transfection of the miR-27a-5p mimic downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB activity, and the expression of NF-κB signaling activators (TAB1, IRAK4, RELA, and FSTL1) in LPS-stimulated hDPCs. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-27a-5p bound directly to the 3’-UTR of TAB1. siTAB1 downregulated NF-κB activity and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression, NF-κB activity, and NF-κB signaling activator expression (TAB1, IRAK4, and RELA) was also found in LPS-stimulated rat incisor pulp tissue explants following transfection with the miR-27a-5p mimic ex vivo. MiR-27a-5p, whose expression was induced by NF-κB signaling, negatively regulated the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines via targeting NF-κB signaling. In particular, TAB1, a potent NF-κB activator, was targeted by miR-27a-5p. These results provide insights into the negative regulatory effects of miR-27a-5p, particularly those targeting the TAB1-NF-κB signaling pathway, on pulp inflammation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","human dental pulp cell; microRNA-27a-5p; NF-κB signaling pathway; proinflammatory cytokine; pulpal inflammation","3 (4 tert butylphenylsulfonyl) 2 propenenitrile; follistatin like 1; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; ketamine; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 27a 5p; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; small interfering RNA; transcription factor RelA; transforming growth factor beta activated kinase 1 binding protein 1; unclassified drug; xylazine; cytokine; MIRN27 microRNA, human; signal transducing adaptor protein; 3' untranslated region; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell infiltration; cytometric bead array; down regulation; ex vivo study; explant; gene expression regulation; genetic transfection; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; inflammation; inflammatory cell; luciferase assay; male; mandibular central incisor; maxillary central incisor; mRNA expression level; NF kB signaling; nonhuman; protein depletion; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; pulpitis; rat; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tooth pulp; upregulation; vasodilatation; Western blotting; animal; cell culture; cytology; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; signal transduction; 3' Untranslated Regions; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; Dental Pulp; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; MicroRNAs; NF-kappa B; Rats; Signal Transduction","","interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; xylazine, 23076-35-9, 7361-61-7; 3' Untranslated Regions; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Cytokines; Lipopolysaccharides; MicroRNAs; MIRN27 microRNA, human; NF-kappa B","This research was funded by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), #21K09870ZA (N.K.), #21K16989ZA (M.F.), #22K09960ZA (T.O.), and TMDU WISE Program (II) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JSTSPRING) #JPMJSP2120 (S.W.).","Hahn, Chinlo, Relationships between Caries Bacteria, Host Responses, and Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Pulpitis, Journal of Endodontics, 33, 3, pp. 213-219, (2007); Jontell, M., Immune defense mechanisms of the dental pulp, Critical Reviews in Oral Biology and Medicine, 9, 2, pp. 179-200, (1998); Jiang, Hongwei, Expression of Toll Like Receptor 4 in Normal Human Odontoblasts and Dental Pulp Tissue, Journal of Endodontics, 32, 8, pp. 747-751, (2006); Mutoh, Noriko, Expression of Toll-like Receptor 2 and 4 in Dental Pulp, Journal of Endodontics, 33, 10, pp. 1183-1186, (2007); Takeuchi, Osamu, Pattern Recognition Receptors and Inflammation, Cell, 140, 6, pp. 805-820, (2010); Kokkas, Andreas B., Irreversible but not reversible pulpitis is associated with up-regulation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human pulp, International Endodontic Journal, 40, 3, pp. 198-203, (2007); Cooper, Paul R., Inflammation-regeneration interplay in the dentine-pulp complex, Journal of Dentistry, 38, 9, pp. 687-697, (2010); Hahn, Chinlo, Innate Immune Responses of the Dental Pulp to Caries, Journal of Endodontics, 33, 6, pp. 643-651, (2007); Giraud, Thomas, Pulp capping materials modulate the balance between inflammation and regeneration, Dental Materials, 35, 1, pp. 24-35, (2019); Lara, Vanessa Soares, Dentin-induced in vivo inflammatory response and in vitro activation of murine macrophages, Journal of Dental Research, 82, 6, pp. 460-465, (2003)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","14220067; 16616596","","","39273640","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203659891"

A random forest classifier with feature selection yielded modest success in the classification of high- and low-motivation states. Further analysis linked high-motivation states to the indices of autonomic nervous system activation reflective of reduced sympathetic activation and stronger, more intense expressions of happiness.

Chemical priming is a promising strategy to enhance tolerance to abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the use of 1-butanol as an effectual strategy to enhance drought stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. We first demonstrated that, among isopropanol, methanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol, pretreatment with 1-butanol was the most effective for enhancing drought tolerance. We tested the plants with a range of 1-butanol concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM) and further determined that 20 mM was the optimal concentration of 1-butanol that enhanced drought tolerance without compromising plant growth. Physiological tests showed that the enhancement of drought tolerance by 1-butanol pretreatment was associated with its stimulation of stomatal closure and improvement of leaf water retention. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between water- and 1-butanol-pretreated plants. The DEGs included genes involved in oxidative stress response processes. The DEGs identified here partially overlapped with those of ethanol-treated plants. Taken together, the results show that 1-butanol is a novel chemical priming agent that effectively enhances drought stress tolerance in Arabidopsis plants, and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-mediated abiotic stress tolerance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1-Butanol; Arabidopsis thaliana; Chemical priming; Drought stress tolerance; Stomatal closure; Transcriptome","butanol; water; Arabidopsis; drought; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; 1-Butanol; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Leaves; Stress, Physiological; Water","","butanol, 35296-72-1, 71-36-3; water, 7732-18-5; 1-Butanol; Water","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from RIKEN, Japan (to MS), including the RIKEN\u2013AIST Joint Research Fund (full research), Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (JPMJCR13B4 to MS), and A-STEP (JPMJTM19BS to MS) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan (Innovative Areas 18H04791 and 18H04705 to MS).; Funding text 2: We thank Chieko Torii, Kayoko Mizunashi, Kyoko Y.

Due to their water-absorbing and soil-binding properties, cellulose nanofibers (CNF) can be applied to soil to enhance soil water retention and aggregate stability. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the drying temperature, dosage, irrigation water quality, and soil type on the efficacy of CNFs. Our results revealed that CNF dried at 5°C is more effective at absorbing water than others, and adding 1% CNF enhanced soil water content up to 98%. The CNF samples absorbed water due to their hydrophilic molecular groups and morphological structure, as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. CNF addition increased the soil volumetric water content and prolonged water retention by 22 days in the paddy soil samples, highlighting its potential for drought-prone areas. Furthermore, irrigation water quality, such as pH and cation values, influenced the interactions between CNF and water molecules, suggesting adjustments to the water retention curve. In its hydrated state, CNF promotes colloid flocculation and binds to soil particles, thereby strengthening the bonds crucial for aggregate formation and stability. CNF enhanced macro-aggregate formation by up to 48% and 59% in the masa and paddy soil samples, respectively.

Films of natural rubber and deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR) prepared with urea were embedded in a mixture of ZnO, vulcanization accelerator and sulfur, and they were heated at 150 °C for 5 h. Migration of Zn from surface to inside of the films was observed by FIB-SEM-EDX. The Zn migrated from the surface to 14 μm for natural rubber, but not for DPNR. The optimum vulcanization time for natural rubber was short, i.e., about 4 min, whereas it was long for DPNR, i.e., about 15 min. To confirm the effect of the proteins, a latex-mixed rubber compound was prepared by mixing the latex with sulfur, ZnO and vulcanization accelerator followed by drying with a hotplate at 150 °C for 45 s since the proteins are segregated on the surface of natural rubber particles in the latex stage. Vulcanization was accelerated for the latex-mixed natural rubber compared with mechanically mixed natural rubber compound that was prepared by mixing natural rubber with ZnO, vulcanization accelerator and sulfur with a two-roll mill. The resulting latex-mixed natural rubber vulcanizate was superior in mechanical properties to the mechanically mixed natural rubber vulcanizate. It was found by rubber-state NMR spectroscopy that the difference in mechanical properties was attributed to the difference in the cis-1,4-average sequence length of the vulcanizates, which came from the difference in the dispersion of Zn. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Dispersions; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Film preparation; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Ion beams; Mixing; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Proteins; Scanning electron microscopy; Sulfur; Urea; Vulcanization; Zinc oxide; 150 ° C; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopies; Hot plates; Nanomatrix structures; Natural rubber compounds; Protein A; Rubber particles; Rubber vulcanizates; Vulcanisation; Rubber","","","Funding text 1: Krittidech Pamanuluk reports article publishing charges and equipment, drugs, or supplies were provided by Nagaoka University of Technology Department of Science of Technology Innovation.This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid (21K18316) for Challenging Research (Pioneering) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JST-aXis (JPMJAS2002) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and MEXT Project (JPMXS0430300121) for promoting public utilization of advanced research infrastructure (Program for the SHARE, GIGAKU-Innovation Equipment Sharing Network) at Nagaoka University of Technology.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid (21K18316) for Challenging Research (Pioneering) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JST-aXis (JPMJAS2002) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and MEXT Project (JPMXS0430300121) for promoting public utilization of advanced research infrastructure (Program for the SHARE, GIGAKU-Innovation Equipment Sharing Network) at Nagaoka University of Technology.","Kawahara, Seiichi, Discovery of island-nanomatrix structure in natural rubber, Polymer Journal, 55, 10, pp. 1007-1021, (2023); Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, (2023); Kawahara, Seiichi, Morphology and properties of natural rubber with nanomatrix of non-rubber components, Polymers for Advanced Technologies, 22, 12, pp. 2665-2667, (2011); Kosugi, Kenichiro, Natural rubber with nanomatrix of non-rubber components observed by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, Colloid and Polymer Science, 293, 1, pp. 135-141, (2015); Suchiva, Krisda, Structure properties of purified natural rubber, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 78, 8, pp. 1495-1504, (2000); Baxter, S., Stress relaxation of vulcanized rubbers I - Theoretical study, Polymer, 4, C, pp. 145-154, (1963); Ding, R., A kinetic model for sulfur accelerated vulcanization of a natural rubber compound, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 61, 3, pp. 455-463, (1996); Mukhopadhyay, Rabindra, Effect of vulcanization temperature and synergism of accelerators on the network and technical properties of efficiently vulcanized natural rubber mixes, Polymer, 19, 10, pp. 1176-1180, (1978); Mostoni, Silvia, Zinc-based curing activators: New trends for reducing zinc content in rubber vulcanization process, Catalysts, 9, 8, (2019); Ortega, Lucía, The effect of vulcanization additives on the dielectric response of styrene-butadiene rubber compounds, Polymer, 172, pp. 205-212, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00323861","","POLMA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195831748"

Through Bayesian logistic models compiled from 40 years of data and built from 684 planted mangrove stands worldwide, we found that biomass C stock culminated at 71 to 73% to that of intact stands ∼20 years after planting. Furthermore, prioritizing mixed-species planting including Rhizophora spp. would maximize C accumulation within the biomass compared to monospecific planting. Despite a 25% increase in the first 5 years following planting, no notable change was observed in the soil C stocks thereafter, which remains at a constant value of 75% to that of intact soil C stock, suggesting that planting effectively prevents further C losses due to land use change. These results have strong implications for mangrove restoration planning and serve as a baseline for future C buildup assessments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","C (programming language); Carbon; Bayesian; Carbon stocks; Constant values; Landuse change; Logistics model; Mixed species; Plantings; Restoration planning; Time frame; Land use; carbon; Bayes theorem; biomass; chemistry; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Rhizophoraceae; soil; wetland; Bayes Theorem; Biomass; Ecosystem; Soil; Wetlands","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Soil","Funding text 1: We would like to express our gratitude to the three anonymous reviewers whose insightful feedback and constructive suggestions significantly contributed to the enhancement of our manuscript.

This study investigates the utility of machine learning algorithms in predicting stroke and identifying key risk factors using data from the Suita study, comprising 7389 participants and 53 variables. Initially, unsupervised k-prototype clustering categorized participants into risk clusters, while five supervised models including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LightGBM) were employed to predict stroke outcomes. Stroke incidence disparities among identified risk clusters using the unsupervised k-prototype clustering method are substantial, according to the findings. Supervised learning, particularly RF, was a preferable option because of the higher levels of performance metrics. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method identified age, systolic blood pressure, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, metabolic syndrome, and blood glucose level as key predictors of stroke, aligning with findings from the unsupervised clustering approach in high-risk groups. Additionally, previously unidentified risk factors such as elbow joint thickness, fructosamine, hemoglobin, and calcium level demonstrate potential for stroke prediction. In conclusion, machine learning facilitated accurate stroke risk predictions and highlighted potential biomarkers, offering a data-driven framework for risk assessment and biomarker discovery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","extreme gradient boost (XGBoost); k-prototype clustering; light gradient boosted machine (LightGBM); logistic regression; random forest; Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP); stroke; supervised machine learning; support vector machine (SVM); unsupervised machine learning","biological marker; calcium; fructosamine; glucose; hemoglobin; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; Article; body mass; calcium blood level; cerebrovascular accident; comparative study; diagnostic test accuracy study; elbow; estimated glomerular filtration rate; extreme gradient boosting; female; fructosamine blood level; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertension; incidence; light gradient boosted machine; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; prediction; random forest; risk assessment; shapley additive explanations method; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; systolic blood pressure; triacylglycerol blood level; unsupervised machine learning","","calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; fructosamine, 4429-04-3; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0","This article was supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) COI-NEXT Grant number JPMJPF2018 to M.A.","Top 10 Causes of Death, (2020); Feigin, Valery L., World Stroke Organization (WSO): Global Stroke Fact Sheet 2022, International Journal of Stroke, 17, 1, pp. 18-29, (2022); Owolabi, Mayowa O., Primary stroke prevention worldwide: translating evidence into action, The Lancet Public Health, 7, 1, pp. e74-e85, (2022); Ambale-Venkatesh, Bharat, Cardiovascular Event Prediction by Machine Learning: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, Circulation Research, 121, 9, pp. 1092-1101, (2017); Kim, Joon-tae, Neural network-based clustering model of ischemic stroke patients with a maximally distinct distribution of 1-year vascular outcomes, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Dritsas, Elias, Stroke Risk Prediction with Machine Learning Techniques, Sensors, 22, 13, (2022); Tazin, Tahia, Stroke Disease Detection and Prediction Using Robust Learning Approaches, Journal of Healthcare Engineering, 2021, (2021); Kokubo, Yoshihiro, Impact of high-normal blood pressure on the risk of cardiovascular disease in a Japanese urban cohort: The Suita study, Hypertension, 52, 4, pp. 652-659, (2008); Kokubo, Yoshihiro, Interaction of blood pressure and body mass index with risk of incident Atrial fibrillation in a Japanese urban cohort: The suita study, American Journal of Hypertension, 28, 11, pp. 1355-1361, (2015); Nakao, Yoko M., Effectiveness of nationwide screening and lifestyle intervention for abdominal obesity and cardiometabolic risks in Japan: The metabolic syndrome and comprehensive lifestyle intervention study on nationwide database in Japan (MetS ACTION-J study), PLOS ONE, 13, 1, (2018)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","23083425","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199616810"

Pectin, a biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide, has shown promise for the synthesis of porous particles, especially in the biomedical and food industries. The high viscosity of pectin and CaCO<inf>3</inf> nanoparticle (NP) solutions has been a significant challenge for producing these particles. This study introduces a novel spray drying technique with a three-fluid nozzle, designed to handle high-viscosity solutions and to increase production rates by 30-fold over the conventional two-fluid nozzle. Using the proposed technique, notable improvements are achieved in particle surface areas and pore volumes by controlling the distribution of CaCO<inf>3</inf> NPs within the pectin particles, especially at a CaCO<inf>3</inf> NPs to pectin ratio of 15. This resulted in porous pectin particles with sizes of 3.4 to 6.2 μm, surface areas of up to 261 m2/g, and enhanced lysozyme adsorption capacities are obtained by varying types of precursor solutions.

Here, a novel gradient-pore-size titanium scaffold was designed and manufactured to address these requirements. The scaffold features a larger pore size (900 μm) on the top surface, gradually decreasing to small sizes (600 μm to 300 μm) towards the center, creating a gradient structure. To enhance its functionality, the additively manufactured scaffolds were biofunctionalized using simple chemical and heat treatments so as to incorporate calcium and iodine ions throughout the surface. This unique combination of varying pore sizes with a biofunctional surface provides highly desirable mechanical properties, bioactivity, and notably, long-lasting antibacterial activity. The target mechanical aspects, including low elastic modulus, high compression, compression-shear, and fatigue strength, were effectively achieved. Furthermore, the biofunctional surface exhibits remarkable in vitro bioactivity and potent antibacterial activity, even under conditions specifically altered to be favorable for bacterial growth. More importantly, the integration of small pores alongside larger ones ensures a sustained high release of iodine, resulting in antimicrobial activity that persisted for over three months, with full eradication of the bacteria. Taken together, this gradient structure exhibits obvious superiority in combining most of the desired properties, making it an ideal candidate for orthopedic and dental implant applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibacterial activity; Apatite; Biocompatibility; Gradient pores; Iodine; Mechanical properties; Selective laser melting","Bacteria; Iodine; Phosphate minerals; Pore size; Scaffolds; Selective laser melting; Anti-bacterial activity; Antibacterial properties; Bioactives; Biofunctional; Gradient pore; Gradient structure; Iodine ions; Long lasting; Mechanical; Biocompatibility; antiinfective agent; iodine; ion; titanium; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ions; Protective Devices; Titanium","","iodine, 7553-56-2; titanium, 7440-32-6; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Iodine; Ions; Titanium","This work was supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency , Gant Number JPMJTR20TA .

This data scarcity poses a significant obstacle to inland flood modeling. However, collecting detailed topographic data is demanding, time-consuming, and costly, making remote sensing techniques a promising solution for developing flood inundation analysis models worldwide. This study presents a novel understanding for utilizing topographical elevations obtained using remote sensing techniques to create a flood inundation analysis model. In a study of three watersheds, Kameda, Niitsu, and Shirone (Japan), the assessment of digital terrain models (DTMs) showed that remote sensing-based DTMs (RS-DTMs) exhibited high reliability of coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square errors, compared with the airborne LiDAR-based topography from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan. Comparing the flood modeling results from LiDAR data and RS-DTM, with Kameda and Niitsu performing favorable outcomes, Shirone exhibited less accurate results. We hypothesized that this was caused by the topographic distortions due to lack of evenly distributed reference points. Hence, we revised the topography by adjusting both the slope and intercept from the regression equation. This verification successfully showed that the flood inundation volume correlation improved, achieving R2 results for the three watersheds ranging from 0.975 to 0.997 and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiencies ranging from 0.938 to 0.986 between the resulting flood models based on the LiDAR data and RS-DTM. Based on these findings, we recognized the significance of uniformly distributed geodetic height points.

In this study, we report a mechanism for in-situ gel formation without external stimulation, resulting in an injectable and tissue-retainable hydrogel for MI treatment, and investigate its therapeutic outcomes. A liquid-like polymeric solution comprising poly(3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid-co-acrylamide) (BAAm), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and sorbitol (S) increases the viscous modulus by reducing the pre-added sorbitol concentration is developed. This solution achieves a sol-gel transition in-vitro in heart tissue by spontaneously diffusing the sorbitol. After intramyocardial injection, the BAAm/PVA/S with lower initial viscous modulus widely spreads in the myocardium and gelate compared to a viscoelastic alginate (ALG) hydrogel and is retained longer than the BAAm/S solution. Serial echocardiogram analyses prove that injecting the BAAm/PVA/S into the hearts of subacute MI rats significantly increases the fraction shortening and ejection shortening and attenuates the expansion of systolic LV diameter for up to 21 d after injection compared to the saline injection as a control, but the ALG injection does not. In addition, histological evaluation shows that only the BAAm/PVA/S decreases the infarct size and increases the wall thickness 21 d after injection. The BAAm/PVA/S intramyocardial injection is better at restraining systolic ventricular dilatation and cardiac failure in the rat MI model than in the control groups. Our findings highlight an effective injectable hydrogel therapy for MI by optimizing injectability-dependent distribution and retention of injected material. Statement of significance: In-situ gelling material is a promising strategy for intramyocardial hydrogel injection therapy for myocardial infarction (MI). Since the sol-gel transition of reported materials is driven by external stimulation such as temperature, pH, or ultraviolet, their application in vivo remains challenging. In this study, we first reported a synthetic in-situ gelling material (BAAm/PVA/S) whose gelation is stimulated by spontaneously reducing pre-added sorbitol after contacting the heart tissue. The BAAm/PVA/S solution spreads evenly, and is retained for at least 21 d in the heart tissue. Our study demonstrated that intramyocardial injection of the BAAm/PVA/S with more extensive distribution and longer retention had better effects on preventing LV dilation and improving cardiac function after MI than that of viscoelastic ALG and saline solution. We expect that these findings provide fundamental information for the optimum design of injectable biomaterials for treating MI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","In-situ gelling material; Injectability; Material distribution; Myocardial infarction; Sugar response; Tissue-retainability","Amides; Cardiology; Ductile fracture; Gelation; Heart; Hydrogels; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Acrylamides; External stimulation; Heart tissues; In-situ gelling material; In-situ-gelling; Injectability; Material distribution; Myocardial Infarction; Sugar response; Tissue-retainability; Tissue; alginic acid; copolymer; hydrogel; poly(3 acrylamidophenylboronic acid co acrylamide; polyvinyl alcohol; sodium chloride; sorbitol; unclassified drug; alprenolol; bromoacetylalprenololmenthane; polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate hydrogel; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biocompatibility; cardiac muscle; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; flow kinetics; gelation; H9c2(2-1) cell line; heart failure; heart infarction; heart infarction size; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart protection; heart tissue; heart ventricle remodeling; histopathology; in vitro study; left ventricular dilatation; left ventricular fractional shortening; left ventricular systolic diameter; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; left ventricular wall thickness; male; nonhuman; rat; shear rate; sol-gel; therapy effect; tissue distribution; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; transthoracic echocardiography; viscoelasticity; viscosity; viscous modulus; animal; pathology; Alprenolol; Animals; Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate; Rats; Sorbitol","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; polyvinyl alcohol, 37380-95-3, 9002-89-5; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1; sorbitol, 26566-34-7, 50-70-4, 53469-19-5; alprenolol, 13655-52-2, 13707-88-5, 39405-98-6, 58615-82-0; bromoacetylalprenololmenthane, 82870-40-4; polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate hydrogel, 25852-47-5; Alprenolol; bromoacetylalprenololmenthane; Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate; Hydrogels; Sorbitol","This work was supported by the Intramural Research Fund of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (21-1-29), JST Grant Number JPMJPF2018, and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21K20526.","Roth, Gregory A., Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors, 1990-2019: Update From the GBD 2019 Study, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 76, 25, pp. 2982-3021, (2020); World J Cardiol, (2017); Heidenreich, Paul A., 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines, Circulation, 145, 18, pp. E895-E1032, (2022); Jou, Stephanie, Heart transplantation: advances in expanding the donor pool and xenotransplantation, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 21, 1, pp. 25-36, (2024); Avolio, Elisa, The role of cardiac pericytes in health and disease: therapeutic targets for myocardial infarction, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 21, 2, pp. 106-118, (2024); Ménasché, Philippe, Cell therapy trials for heart regeneration — lessons learned and future directions, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 15, 11, pp. 659-671, (2018); Frangogiannis, Nikolaos Georgios, Pathophysiology of myocardial infarction, Comprehensive Physiology, 5, 4, pp. 1841-1875, (2015); Powers, Joseph D., Biomechanical signals regulating the structure of the heart, Current Opinion in Physiology, 25, (2022); Voorhees, Andrew P., Biomechanics of cardiac function, Comprehensive Physiology, 5, 4, pp. 1623-1644, (2015); Goonoo, Nowsheen, Tunable biomaterials for myocardial tissue regeneration: promising new strategies for advanced biointerface control and improved therapeutic outcomes, Biomaterials Science, 10, 7, pp. 1626-1646, (2022)","","Acta Materialia Inc","","","","","","18787568; 17427061","","","38242190","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184155897"

To examine the use of AAC scrap for roadbed materials, this study investigated mechanical properties such as compaction curves and bearing capacity [i.e., California bearing ratio (CBR)] as well as the particle breakage, and hydraulic properties of well– and poorly–graded recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) blended with AAC grains made from AAC grains in different proportions (f) on a mass basis.The results showed that the compaction curves were mainly affected by particle size distribution and f. The f ≤ 30% is recommended for use as unbound roadbed materials based on the CBR results. The breakage of RCA itself was reduced due to the cushioning effect with increasing of f and the easily breakable property of AAC grains controlled the mechanical and hydraulic properties.

HFMD-associated serotypes of Enterovirus A (EVA) family include EVA71, Coxsackievirus A type 6 (CVA6), 10 (CVA10), and 16 (CVA16). Although prevalent in numerous Asian countries, studies on HFMD-causing agents in wastewater are scarce. This study aimed to conduct wastewater surveillance in various Asian communities to detect and quantify serotypes of EVA associated with HFMD. In total, 77 wastewater samples were collected from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam from March 2022 to February 2023. The detection ratio for CVA6 RNA in samples from Vietnam was 40 % (8/20). The detection ratio for CVA6 and EVA71 RNA each was 25 % (5/20) for the Indonesian samples, indicating the need for clinical surveillance of CVA6, as clinical reports have been limited. For the Philippines, 12 % (2/17) of the samples were positive for CVA6 and EVA71 RNA each, with only one quantifiable sample each. Samples from Thailand had a lower detection ratio (1/20) for CVA6 RNA, and the concentration was unquantifiable. Conversely, CVA10 and CVA16 RNAs were not detected in any of the samples. The minimum and maximum concentrations of CVA6 RNA were 2.7 and 3.9 log<inf>10</inf> copies/L and those for EVA71 RNA were 2.5 and 4.9 log<inf>10</inf> copies/L, respectively. This study underscores the importance of wastewater surveillance in understanding the epidemiology of HFMD-associated EVA serotypes in Asian communities. Long-term wastewater surveillance is recommended to monitor changes in dominant serotypes, understand seasonality, and develop effective prevention and control strategies for HFMD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian countries; Coxsackievirus; Coxsackievirus A type 6; Enterovirus A serotype 71; Foot and mouth disease; Hand; Wastewater surveillance","Asian countries; Coxsackievirus; Coxsackievirus A type 6; Enterovirus A serotype 71; Foot and mouth disease; Hand; Philippines; Serotypes; Thailand; Wastewater surveillance; RNA; virus RNA; epidemiology; foot and mouth disease; quantitative analysis; virus; wastewater; Article; Asian; clinical monitoring; community assessment; controlled study; Coxsackievirus A6; Enterovirus; Enterovirus A71; hand foot and mouth disease; Indonesia; Japan; maximum concentration; minimum concentration; nonhuman; prevention and control; seasonal variation; Viet Nam; virus concentration; virus detection; wastewater-based epidemiology; water monitoring; water sampling; child; China; human; phylogeny; Child; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Phylogeny; Wastewater; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring","","RNA, 63231-63-0; RNA; Wastewater","This study was supported by the Hitachi Global Foundation through Hitachi Fund Support for Research Related to Infectious Diseases, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) through e-ASIA Joint Research Program (grant number JPMJSC20E2), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) through Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (grant number JP23H01536), and Indonesian Kemendikbudristek Research Grant (grant number 2473/IT1.C07.2/TA.00/2022).

Therefore, the pigs are required to have as low a PERV copy number as possible. In this study, firstly, we investigated the estimates of heritabilities for the PERV copy numbers in the Vietnamese native breeds. Genomic heritabilities for four genes on PERV were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood method with the genomic relationship matrix. The genomic heritability estimates of these genes ranged from 0.27 to 0.71, indicating that it would be possible for these genes not to follow the normal Mendelian inheritance. Secondly, we bred the pig population to reduce the pol gene number and estimated the heritability for the number. Despite the high heritability estimate for the pol gene (0.59), little improvement was progressed after selection for reducing the gene number in the three generations. In order to reduce the PERV copy numbers from the pig genome, it would be difficult to adapt only conventional breeding technology, and we need to consider using another technology like genome editing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","a pol gene; non-Mendelian inheritance; PERV; real-time PCR; REML","animal; breeding; copy number variation; endogenous retrovirus; genetics; pig; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; structural gene; Animals; Breeding; DNA Copy Number Variations; Endogenous Retroviruses; Genes, pol; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Swine","","","The authors would like to thank Satoshi Mikawa for the help on the analysis of this study.

Introducing multiple BPH resistance genes into rice cultivars is an effective and sustainable way to mitigate yield losses. A traditional rice cultivar, ‘Rathu Heenati’, has durable BPH resistance due to multiple resistance genes (including BPH3 and BPH17) and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, these genes have not been used in Japanese rice breeding owing to limited genetic information. To identify markers tightly linked to BPH3 and BPH17 introgressed into the ‘Sagabiyori’ (susceptible) genetic background, we performed substitution mapping. BPH3 was delimited between RM3132 and RM589 on chromosome 6, and BPH17 between RM16493 and RM16531 on chromosome 4. We also performed QTL analysis to identify additional BPH resistance genes from ‘Rathu Heenati’ and detected a QTL, denoted as qBPH3.1, on chromosome 3. The effect of pyramiding BPH3 and BPH17 was significantly greater against virulent BPH populations than that of either gene alone. The combination of BPH3, BPH17 and qBPH3.1 from ‘Rathu Heenati’ might be facilitated to improve commercial Japanese cultivars with more robust BPH resistance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BPH resistance; gene mapping; pyramiding; rice","","","","Funding text 1: We thank the staff of the Insect Pest Management Research Group, Kyushu Okinawa Agricultural Research Center, NARO, for rearing and providing the insect populations.

In Vietnam, however, being a developing country with a rapid rate of urbanization, especially in major cities, the substantial amount of CDW generated is still mainly treated by landfilling. To promote the recycling of CDW, studies of the performance of structural members fabricated with recycled aggregates must be conducted, which are lacking in quantity in Vietnam. Adopting a standard experiment set up of reinforced beams, the study employed local recycled coarse aggregates in Hanoi, Vietnam, produced from crushed concrete and crushed brick (which is mixed with crushed concrete at controlled percentages) to conduct experiments to observe flexural behaviors with reference to equivalent natural aggregate concrete (NAC) such as cracking load, ultimate load, crack pattern, crack width, etc. The results showed that the ultimate loads were only reduced by less than 10% for all percentages of recycled coarse aggregate produced from crushed brick in the concrete mix, compared to the reference beams using NAC. However, the cracking loads of RAC beams were significantly reduced by 17.86% to 50.45% when increasing the content of crushed brick from 0% to 70%. Moreover, together with an increase in the number of flexural cracks, the deflections of RAC beams also increased with increasing content of crushed brick, demonstrating a reduction in the stiffness of the beams. These observations may serve as recommendations to structural engineers in Vietnam when designing flexural RAC members. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction and demolition waste; Flexural strength; Recycled aggregate concrete; Reinforced concrete beam","","","","This research was supported by JST\u2013JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Nixon, Philip J., Recycled concrete as an aggregate for concrete-a review, Materiaux et constructions, 11, 5, pp. 371-378, (1978); Sri Ravindrarajah, R., Properties of concrete made with crushed concrete as coarse aggregate, Magazine of Concrete Research, 37, 130, pp. 29-38, (1985); de Oliveira, M.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with a low concentration of ethanol enhances abiotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis and cassava. Here, we show that ethanol treatment induces heat stress tolerance in tomato (Solanum lycopersicon L.) plants. Seedlings of the tomato cultivar ‘Micro-Tom’ were pretreated with ethanol solution and then subjected to heat stress. The survival rates of the ethanol-pretreated plants were significantly higher than those of the water-treated control plants. Similarly, the fruit numbers of the ethanol-pretreated plants were greater than those of the water-treated ones. Transcriptome analysis identified sets of genes that were differentially expressed in shoots and roots of seedlings and in mature green fruits of ethanol-pretreated plants compared with those in water-treated plants. Gene ontology analysis using these genes showed that stress-related gene ontology terms were found in the set of ethanol-induced genes. Metabolome analysis revealed that the contents of a wide range of metabolites differed between water- and ethanol-treated samples. They included sugars such as trehalose, sucrose, glucose, and fructose. From our results, we speculate that ethanol-induced heat stress tolerance in tomato is mainly the result of increased expression of stress-related genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination enzymes, and activated gluconeogenesis. Our results will be useful for establishing ethanol-based chemical priming technology to reduce heat stress damage in crops, especially in Solanaceae. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","chemical priming; ethanol; heat stress; metabolome; micro-tom; transcriptome","","","","Funding text 1: The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Counting accuracy is limited, especially at higher densities, when the faces are relatively small, unclear, and viewed at various angles. Furthermore, it is costly to create the ground-truth bounding boxes needed to train object detection methods. We formulate masked face detection as a fine-grained crowd-counting task, which is appropriate for tackling this challenging task when used with density map regression. However, adopting fine-grained crowd-counting methods for masked face counting is not trivial. It is necessary to identify strategies appropriate for both counting and multi-class classification. We contrasted the strategies of various approaches and examined their benefits and drawbacks. These strategies include (1) simple regression with mixed regression and detection for counting, (2) using class-aware density maps with semantic segmentation maps and class probabilities for classification, and (3) counting with or without depth information enhancement. Analysis of seven crowd-counting methods on three datasets with a total of about 900k annotations demonstrated that the level of congestion affects how well simple regression and mixed regression and detection work for counting. Meanwhile, the most effective approach for classification is using semantic segmentation maps. Evaluation of the usefulness of using depth data demonstrated the need for a depth map to achieve accurate counting. These findings should be useful for future studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comparative study; fine-grained counting; mask-wearing ratio estimation; masked face datasets; multi-class object counting","Classification (of information); Job analysis; Object detection; Regression analysis; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Annotation; Class objects; Comparatives studies; Crowdsensing; Density measurement; Fine grained; Fine-grained counting; Mask-wearing ratio estimation; Masked face dataset; Multi-class object counting; Object counting; Ratio estimations; Semantic segmentation; Task analysis; Face recognition","","","This work was supported in part by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI under Grant JP16H06302, Grant JP18H04120, Grant JP20K23355, Grant JP21H04907, and Grant JP21K18023; and in part by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST, Japan, under Grant JPMJCR18A6 and Grant JPMJCR20D3.","Almalki, Khalid Jaber, CATS: Crowd-based Alert and Tracing Services for building a Safe Community Cluster against COVID-19, pp. 697-701, (2021); An Automatic System to Monitor the Physical Distance and Face Mask Wearing of Construction Workers in Covid 19 Pandemic, (2021); Sindagi, Vishwanath A., A survey of recent advances in CNN-based single image crowd counting and density estimation, Pattern Recognition Letters, 107, pp. 3-16, (2018); Lin, Shengfuu, Estimation of number of people in crowded scenes using perspective transformation, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans, 31, 6, pp. 645-654, (2001); Li, Min, Estimating the number of people in crowded scenes by MID based foreground segmentation and head-shoulder detection, Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition, (2008); Li, Yuhong, CSRNet: Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks for Understanding the Highly Congested Scenes, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1091-1100, (2018); Liu, Jiang, DecideNet: Counting Varying Density Crowds Through Attention Guided Detection and Density Estimation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5197-5206, (2018); Eccv, (2018); Liu, Yuting, Point in, box out: Beyond counting persons in crowds, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019-June, pp. 6462-6471, (2019); Wan, Jia, Fine-Grained Crowd Counting, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 30, pp. 2114-2126, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186098756"

This poses a serious threat to eKYC systems and a danger to individuals' personal information and property. Existing deepfake datasets are not particularly appropriate for developing and evaluating eKYC systems, which require specific motions, such as head movement, for liveness detection. Furthermore, they do not contain ID information or protocols for facial verification evaluation, which is vital for eKYC. We found that eKYC systems without the ability to detect deepfakes can be easily compromised. We have thus created a large-scale collection of high-quality fake videos (more than 228,000 videos) that are diverse in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity, plus a corresponding facial image subset. The videos include a variety of head movements and facial expressions. This large collection of high-quality diverse videos is well-suited for developing and evaluating various tasks related to eKYC systems. Furthermore, we provide protocols for traditional deepfake detection and facial verification, which are widely used in eKYC systems. It is worth mentioning that systematic evaluation of facial recognition systems on deepfake detection has not been reported.

In our setup, CP violation is provided by dimensional-5 Yukawa interactions involving the complex scalar field. In contrast to previous studies in the literature, we exemplify a case in which a complex phase in the singlet scalar potential is transmitted to the fermion sector via the higher-dimensional operators and drives BAU. We point out that an electric dipole moment of the electron can be suppressed due to the Higgs mass degeneracy and the presence of a new electron Yukawa coupling.

However, the current methods are often expensive, complicated, and time-consuming, which limits their practical application. In this study, a simple and low-cost method was developed using the extract of Moringa oleifera (MO) seeds (MO method) to recover both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), murine norovirus (MNV), Aichivirus (AiV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and influenza A virus subtype H1N1[H1N1] in wastewater. The optimal conditions for the MO method were determined to be a concentration of MO extract at the UV<inf>280</inf> value of 0.308 cm−1 and an elution buffer (0.05 M KH<inf>2</inf>PO<inf>4</inf>, 1 M NaCl, 0.1 % Tween80 [v/v]) for recovering the tested viruses in wastewater. Compared to other commonly used virus concentration methods such as InnovaPrep, HA, PEG, and Centricon, the MO method was found to be more efficient and cost-effective in recovering the tested viruses. Moreover, the MO method was successfully applied to detect various types of viruses (PMMoV, AiV, norovirus of genotype II [NoV II], enterovirus [EV], influenza A virus [matrix gene] [IAV], and SARS-CoV-2) in raw wastewater. Thus, the developed MO method could offer a simple, low-cost, and efficient tool to concentrate viruses in wastewater. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficient tool; Low-cost; Moringa seed; Virus concentration; Wastewater","Cost effectiveness; Recovery; Sodium chloride; Efficient tool; Low cost methods; Low-costs; Moringa; Moringa oleifera; Moringa seed; Pepper mild mottle virus; Simple++; Virus concentration; Virus concentration methods; Viruses; macrogol; Moringa oleifera extract; comparative study; concentration (composition); seed; virus; wastewater; adsorption; Aichi virus; Article; cost; elution; Influenza A virus (H1N1); intermethod comparison; Murine hepatitis virus; Murine norovirus; nonhuman; pepper mild mottle virus; plant seed; plant virus; ultrafiltration; virus concentration; virus detection; wastewater-based epidemiology; animal; mouse; Norovirus; Animals; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Mice; Wastewater","","macrogol, 25322-68-3; Wastewater","We thank Dr. Ayato Takada at Hokkaido University for generously providing influenza virus H1N1.

However, the effects of past long-term land cover changes on the characteristics of recent landslides remains underexplored. We studied land cover evolution over a 56-year period on Omishima Island in western Japan to examine the spatial relations of landslides in the July 2018 storm event based on rainfall, land cover trajectories, and topography. We generated land cover maps for 1962, 1981, and 2018 by aerial photo interpretation. We also identified 512 new landslides. Based on 47-year precipitation records, we estimated the return periods of 1- to 264-h rainfalls during the storm using the generalised extreme value (GEV) distributions. Return periods showed wide variation when the derived GEV distributions were applied to 1-km grid rainfall distributions. Despite such pronounced spatial variations in rainfall, we did not observe a clear correlation between rainfall intensity and landslide distribution. In contrast, land cover trajectories had a pronounced effect on landslide occurrence. Landslides were more concentrated on slopes that experienced land cover changes after 1962. A comparison of slopes on farmland developed between 1962 and 1981 (mainly citrus orchards) indicated that landslide density and area ratio were significantly lower on slopes that had reverted to forests than on those remaining as farmland. However, the values of the reforested slopes exceeded those of forests and farmlands that remained since before 1962. Our geospatial analysis revealed that even if the field had shifted to forests, the effects of reduced slope stability due to orchard development had remained for at least 37 years.

A low-cost nanotechnological material method was employed for this work. The binary structure component consists of 17,557 nano-sized rods made of two lead–bismuth–gallium silicate glasses which were developed in-house. Those small rods are spatially arranged in such a way that, according to effective medium theory, the refractive index of this internal structure is constant in the radial direction and linearly changes following azimuthal angle. Numerical results demonstrated that a nanostructured vortex phase mask with a thickness of 19 μm can convert Gaussian beams into fundamental optical vortices over 290 nm wavelength bandwidth from 1275 to 1565 nm. This has been confirmed in experiments using three diode laser sources operating at 1310, 1550, and 1565 nm. The generation of vortex beams is verified through their uniform doughnut-like intensity distributions, clear astigmatic transformation patterns, and spiral as well as fork-like interferograms. This new flat-surface component can be directly mounted to an optical fiber tip for simplifying vortex generator systems as well as easier manipulation of the generated OVB in three-dimensional space. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","gallium; glass; glass fiber; article; astigmatism; bandwidth; controlled study; diode laser; generator; mask; optics; refraction index; thickness","","gallium, 7440-55-3, 14391-02-7","This work was supported by Narodowe Centrum Nauki (PRELUDIUM-20 UMO-2021/41/N/ST7/01517), HORIZON EIC Pathfinder (ReaCtor 101099405), Kakenhi Grants-in-Aid (Nos.

Infected patients could progress to severe plasma leakage and hemorrhagic shock, where current standard treatment remains supportive. Previous reports suggested that several flavonoid derivatives inhibited mosquito-borne flaviviruses. This work aimed to explore sulfonamide chalcone derivatives as dengue inhibitors and to identify molecular targets. We initially screened 27 sulfonamide chalcones using cell-based antiviral and cytotoxic screenings. Two potential compounds, SC22 and SC27, were identified with DENV1-4 EC<inf>50</inf>s in the range of 0.71–0.94 and 3.15–4.46 μM, and CC<inf>50</inf>s at 14.63 and 31.02 μM, respectively. The compounds did not show any elevation in ALT or Cr in C57BL/6 mice on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days after being administered intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg SC22 or SC27 in a single dose. Moreover, the SAM-binding site of NS5 methyltransferase was a potential target of SC27 identified by computational and enzyme-based assays. The main target of SC22 was in a late stage of viral replication, but the exact target molecule had yet to be identified. In summary, a sulfonamide chalcone, SC27, was a potential DENV inhibitor that targeted viral methyltransferase. Further investigation should be the study of the structure-activity relationship of SC27 derivatives for higher potency and lower toxicity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chalcone; Dengue; Flavonoid; Methyltransferase; Sulfonamide","ademetionine; alanine aminotransferase; antivirus agent; chalcone derivative; creatinine; methyltransferase; sulfonamide; virus enzyme; chalcone; viral nonstructural protein; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; antiviral activity; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; computer model; controlled study; creatinine blood level; Dengue virus; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; Dengue virus 3; Dengue virus 4; drug binding site; drug cytotoxicity; drug screening; EC50; enzyme assay; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; single drug dose; virus replication; animal; binding site; C57BL mouse; chemistry; dengue; human; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Binding Sites; Chalcone; Chalcones; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Humans; Methyltransferases; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Sulfonamides; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Virus Replication","","ademetionine, 29908-03-0, 485-80-3; alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4; chalcone, 94-41-7; Antiviral Agents; Chalcone; Chalcones; Methyltransferases; Sulfonamides; Viral Nonstructural Proteins","This research project is supported by Ratchadapiseksompotch Research fund, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University ( RA-MF-12/65 , RA 25/66 ).

In addition to protecting germs from antibiotics, biofilms reduce the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy. The nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related with the biofilm forming phenotype of Helicobacter pylori were studied. Results: Fifty-six H. pylori isolate from Bangladeshi patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Crystal violet assay was used to quantify biofilm amount, and the strains were classified into high- and low-biofilm formers As a result, strains were classified as 19.6% high- and 81.4% low-biofilm formers. These phenotypes were not related to specific clades in the phylogenetic analysis. The accessories genes associated with biofilm from whole-genome sequences were extracted and analysed, and SNPs among the previously reported biofilm-related genes were analysed. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with SNPs of alpA, alpB, cagE, cgt, csd4, csd5, futB, gluP, homD, and murF (P < 0.05). Among the SNPs reported in alpB, strains encoding the N156K, G160S, and A223V mutations were high-biofilm formers. Conclusions: This study revealed the potential role of SNPs in biofilm formation and proposed a method to detect mutation in biofilm from whole-genome sequences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibiotic resistance; Biofilm formation; Infectious disease; SNP; Variants; Whole-genome sequences","alpA gene; alpB gene; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genetics; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; Bangladeshi; biofilm; cagE gene; cgt gene; cladistics; controlled study; cross-sectional study; csd4 gene; csd5 gene; futB gene; gene identification; genetic association; genetic code; gluP gene; Helicobacter pylori; homD gene; human; human tissue; murF gene; nonhuman; phylogeny; randomized controlled trial; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing; genetics; Helicobacter infection; antiinfective agent; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biofilms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Phylogeny","","Anti-Bacterial Agents","Funding text 1: This study was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (DK62813) (YY) and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan (18KK0266, 19H03473, 21H00346 and 22H02871) (Y.Y.)

Nevertheless, this has been very challenging due to the lack of reliable room-temperature ferromagnetism in well-known group IV and III-V based semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature spin injection by using spin pumping in a BiSb/(Ga,Fe)Sb heterostructure, where (Ga,Fe)Sb is a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) with high Curie temperature (T<inf>C</inf>) and BiSb is a topological insulator (TI). Despite the very small magnetization of (Ga,Fe)Sb at room temperature (45 emu/cc), we detected spin injection from (Ga,Fe)Sb by utilizing the large inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in BiSb. Our study provides the first demonstration of spin injection at room temperature from a FMS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 20H05650, No. 18H03860, 18H05345, and No. 17H04922), CREST (JPMJCR1777, JPMJCR18T5) and PRESTO (JPMJPR19LB) of JST, the Spintronics Research Network of Japan (Spin-RNJ), and the Murata Science Foundation.

However, the brain processes involved in PW control, which encompass cortical regions and interregional interactions, are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the changes in regional activity and effective connectivity within the frontoparietal network associated with PW. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy data were recorded from adult subjects during treadmill walking tasks, including normal walking (NOR) and PW with visual cues, wherein the intercue distance was either fixed (FIX) or randomly varied (VAR) across steps. The superior parietal lobule (SPL), dorsal premotor area (PMd), supplementary motor area (SMA), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) were specifically targeted. The results revealed higher activities in SMA and left PMd, as well as left-to-right SPL connectivity, in VAR than in FIX. Activities in SMA and right dlPFC, along with dlPFC-to-SPL connectivity, were higher in VAR than in NOR. Overall, these findings provide insights into the roles of different brain regions and connectivity patterns within the frontoparietal network in facilitating gait control during PW, providing a useful baseline for further investigations into brain networks involved in locomotion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","brain connectivity; fNIRS; frontoparietal network; gait; precision walking","adult; Article; association; brain region; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; electroencephalogram; female; frontoparietal cortex; frontoparietal network; functional connectivity; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; normal human; precision walking; premotor cortex; step length; step width; superior parietal lobule; supplementary motor area; task performance; treadmill exercise; walking; walking distance; young adult; brain; brain mapping; near infrared spectroscopy; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cues; Humans; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Walking","","","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (20H04044 to SU and MM, 23K10503 to SU), research funds from Hiroshima University (187018 to SU), and JST SPRING (JPMJSP2132 to DTL).","Artoni, Fiorenzo, Unidirectional brain to muscle connectivity reveals motor cortex control of leg muscles during stereotyped walking, NeuroImage, 159, pp. 403-416, (2017); Ahsan Awais, Muhammad, Effective connectivity for decoding electroencephalographic motor imagery using a probabilistic neural network, Sensors, 21, 19, (2021); Bakker, Maaike, Cerebral correlates of motor imagery of normal and precision gait, NeuroImage, 41, 3, pp. 998-1010, (2008); Barbas, Helen, Architecture and intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex in the rhesus monkey, Journal of Comparative Neurology, 286, 3, pp. 353-375, (1989); Barnett, Lionel C., The MVGC multivariate Granger causality toolbox: A new approach to Granger-causal inference, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 223, pp. 50-68, (2014); Bellot, Emmanuelle, Moving Toward versus Away from Another: How Body Motion Direction Changes the Representation of Bodies and Actions in the Visual Cortex, Cerebral Cortex, 31, 5, pp. 2670-2685, (2021); Beurze, Sabine M., Reference frames for reach planning in human parietofrontal cortex, Journal of Neurophysiology, 104, 3, pp. 1736-1745, (2010); Blennerhassett, Jannette Maree, One-Quarter of People Leave Inpatient Stroke Rehabilitation with Physical Capacity for Community Ambulation, Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, 27, 12, pp. 3404-3410, (2018); Cavada, Carmen, Posterior parietal cortex in rhesus monkey: I.

Moreover, the obtained supported Au nanoparticles (NPs) were effective as catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation, intramolecular cyclization of alkynyl carboxylic acids, and isomerization of allylic esters. Their results suggested that the reduction of [Au(OH)(IPr)] proceeds rapidly from around 300°C, and the residual ligands should be attached to the surface of the Au NPs and protect them from drastic agglutination.

After adding Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, all flasks reported a significant increase in COD removal efficiency, especially for acetone-only and latex-only vials, from 36.9% to 14.30%–42.95% and 83.20%, respectively. Other highlighted results of COD balance showed that Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> involvement improved the degradation process of acetate, propionate, acetone, and the other COD parts, including the intermediate products of latex reduction. Besides, during the whole batch process, the order of reduction priority of the carbon sources in the synthetic wastewater was acetate, propionate and acetone. We also found that the acetate concentration appeared to be strongly related to reducing other carbon sources in natural rubber wastewater. Microbial community analysis revealed that protein-degrading bacteria Bacteroidetes vadinHA17 and Proteinniphilum and methylotrophic methanogens might play key roles in treating simulated deproteinized-natural-rubber wastewater. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetone; Deproteinized natural rubber production process; Ferroferric oxide; Microbial community analysis; Synthetic latex wastewater","Acetone; Biodegradation; Carbon; Chemical oxygen demand; Degradation; Magnetite; Microorganisms; Volatile fatty acids; Wastewater treatment; % reductions; Anaerobic degradation; Carbon source; Deproteinized natural rubber production process; Ferroferric oxides; Microbial community analysis; Production process; Rubber production; Rubber wastewater; Synthetic latex wastewater; Rubber; acetic acid; acetone; carbon; latex; magnetite; propionic acid; acetic acid derivative; rubber; anaerobic digestion; chemical oxygen demand; degradation; microbial activity; microbial community; reduction; wastewater; wastewater treatment; Article; batch process; biodiversity; carbon source; controlled study; nonhuman; reduction (chemistry); anaerobic growth; metabolism; microbiology; procedures; sewage; Acetates; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Latex; Propionates; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater","","acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1, 6131-90-4; acetone, 67-64-1; carbon, 7440-44-0; magnetite, 1309-38-2, 1317-61-9; propionic acid, 72-03-7, 79-09-4; rubber, 9006-04-6; Acetates; Acetone; Carbon; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Latex; Propionates; Rubber; Wastewater","This research was supported from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) – Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) SATREPS Program (JPMJSA2103).","Sci Works Univ Food Technol, (2018); Proceedings International Conference on Environmental Research and Technology, (2008); Baek, Gahyun, A long-term study on the effect of magnetite supplementation in continuous anaerobic digestion of dairy effluent – Enhancement in process performance and stability, Bioresource Technology, 222, pp. 344-354, (2016); Berntsson, Svante, Spectrophotometric Determination of Acetone by the Salicylaldehyde Method, Analytical Chemistry, 28, 8, (1956); Bottier, Céline, Biochemical composition of Hevea brasiliensis latex: A focus on the protein, lipid, carbohydrate and mineral contents, Advances in Botanical Research, 93, pp. 201-237, (2020); Bousquet, Jean J., Natural rubber latex allergy among health care workers: A systematic review of the evidence, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 118, 2, pp. 447-454, (2006); Caporaso, J.

AAC is a high-porosity material with a surface rich in metal hydroxides, which promotes both biofilm growth and phosphate binding. This study assessed the efficiency of using AAC grains for the recovery of phosphorus (P) and biological treatment of municipal wastewater (MWW). Batch adsorption tests using synthetic phosphate-rich wastewater determined the affinity of P for 3–5 mm and 5–10 mm AAC grains, and P adsorption profiles were obtained. AAC grains adsorbed P well with maximum adsorption of 1.1 mg P/g based on the Langmuir isotherm model and a P removal efficiency of >96% (initial P concentration 30 mg/L). Biofiltration through three reactor tanks with AAC particles (30–50 mm and 3–5 mm) was performed by circulating MWW with retention times of 19–40 h to evaluate the elimination efficiency (E) of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in each reactor tank. The biofiltration system effectively removed the target pollutants, with E values ranging from 80% to 90% for COD, 38% to 70% for TN, and 80% to 92% for TP. The high E values led to P recovery from MWW, resulting in a P content of 1.33 g/kg of AAC in the biofiltration system. This study demonstrated that AAC waste can serve as an inexpensive and easily recyclable P recovery material in the biofiltration system used to treat MWW. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC); Biofiltration; Municipal wastewater; Phosphorus; Sorption","Adsorption; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Efficiency; Isotherms; Recovery; Wastewater treatment; Autoclaved aerated concrete; Biofiltration systems; Biofiltrations; Chemical-oxygen demands; Concrete grains; E values; Municipal wastewaters; Total nitrogen; Total phosphorus; Phosphorus","","","This research was supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) — Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (No. JPMJSA1701 ).","Abd Roni, Norwardatun, The vertical recycled concrete aggregate filter for removal of phosphorus in wastewater, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 646, 1, (2021); Abou-Elela, Sohair I., Utilization of autoclaved aerated concrete solid waste as a bio-carrier in immobilized bioreactor for municipal wastewater treatment, Desalination and Water Treatment, 168, pp. 108-116, (2019); Ádám, Kinga, Phosphorus retention in the filter materials shellsand and Filtralite P®-Batch and column experiment with synthetic P solution and secondary wastewater, Ecological Engineering, 29, 2, pp. 200-208, (2007); Agyei, Nana M., The removal of phosphate ions from aqueous solution by fly ash, slag, ordinary Portland cement and related blends, Cement and Concrete Research, 32, 12, pp. 1889-1897, (2002); Azizian, Saeid, Adsorption isotherms and kinetics, Interface Science and Technology, 33, pp. 445-509, (2021); Bao, Teng, Advanced wastewater treatment with autoclaved aerated concrete particles in biological aerated filters, Journal of Water Process Engineering, 9, pp. 188-194, (2016); Bao, Teng, Use of autoclaved aerated concrete particles for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus as filter media from domestic wastewater, Environmental Technology (United Kingdom), 41, 23, pp. 3032-3042, (2020); Borrachero, María Victoria, Reusing Construction and Demolition Waste to Prepare Alkali-Activated Cement, Materials, 15, 10, (2022); Bui, Nguyen Khanh, Water environmental protection in craft villages of Vietnam, E3S Web of Conferences, 258, (2021); Geosci Eng, (2014)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","23521864","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158888116"

Moreover, Wi-Fi technology has undergone gradual development, with various standards and implementations. In a Wi-Fi network, a Wi-Fi client typically uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for its applications. Hence, it is essential to understand and quantify the TCP performance in such an environment. This work presents an emulator-based approach for investigating the TCP performance in Wi-Fi networks in a time- and cost-efficient manner. We introduce a new platform, which leverages the Mininet-WiFi emulator to construct various Wi-Fi networks for investigation while considering actual TCP implementations. The platform uniquely includes tools and scripts to assess TCP performance in the Wi-Fi networks quickly. First, to confirm the accuracy of our platform, we compare the emulated results to the results in a real Wi-Fi network, where the bufferbloat problem may occur. The two results are not only similar but also usable for finding the bufferbloat condition under different methods of TCP congestion control. Second, we conduct a similar evaluation in scenarios with the Wi-Fi link as a bottleneck and those with varying signal strengths. Third, we use the platform to compare the fairness performance of TCP congestion control algorithms in a Wi-Fi network with multiple clients. The results show the efficiency and convenience of our platform in recognizing TCP behaviors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","congestion control; emulator; evaluation; TCP; Wi-Fi","Internet of things; Traffic congestion; Transmission control protocol; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bufferbloat; Condition; Congestion control; Cost-efficient; Emulator; Evaluation; ITS applications; Protocol implementation; Time-efficient; Transmission control protocol performance; Wi-Fi","","","This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) under Grant 20H0417, 23H03377 and in part by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), with the establishment of university fellowships towards the creation of science technology innovation, Grant Number JPMJFS2107.","Zettabyte Era Trends and Analysis, (2025); Ganji, Anirudh, Characterizing the performance of wifi in dense IoT deployments, Proceedings - International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, ICCCN, 2019-July, (2019); Horie, Yuki, A Comparison of Congestion Control Algorithms in Emulated Wi-Fi Networks, International Conference on ICT Convergence, 2020-October, pp. 305-310, (2020); Ganji, Anirudh, Choosing TCP Variants for Cloud Tenants-A Measurement based Approach, Proceedings - International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, ICCCN, 2020-August, (2020); Lukaseder, Thomas, A Comparison of TCP Congestion Control Algorithms in 10G Networks, pp. 706-714, (2016); Taruk, Medi, Comparison of TCP variants in Long Term Evolution (LTE), 2018-January, pp. 131-134, (2017); Poorzare, Reza, Challenges on the way of implementing TCP over 5G networks, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 176393-176415, (2020); Polese, Michele, TCP and MP-TCP in 5G mmWave Networks, IEEE Internet Computing, 21, 5, pp. 12-19, (2017); Grieco, Luigi Alfredo, Performance evaluation and comparison of Westwood+, New Reno, and Vegas TCP congestion control, Computer Communication Review, 34, 2, pp. 25-38, (2004); Shi, Hanbing, Intelligent TCP Congestion Control Policy Optimization, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19995903","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166386487"

Nature complex structure of the respiratory system requires much effort to explore and comprehend the flow and the inhaled particle dynamics for precise health risk assessment. Therefore, this study applied the computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) method to elucidate the deposition characteristics of ultrafine-to-coarse particles in the human respiratory tract from nostrils to the 16th generation of terminal bronchi. Methods: The realistic bronchi up to the 8th generation are precisely and perfectly generated from computed tomography (CT) images, and an artificial model compensates for the 9th-16th bronchioles. Herein, the steady airflow is simulated at constant breathing flow rates of 7.5, 15, and 30 L/min, reproducing human resting-intense activity. Then, trajectories of the particle size ranging from 0.002 – 10 μm are tracked using a discrete phase model. Results: Here, we report reliable results of airflow patterns and particle deposition efficiency in the human respiratory system validated against experimental data. The individual-related focal point of ultrafine and fine particles deposition rates was actualized at the 8th generation; whilst the hot-spot of the deposited coarse particles was found in the 6th generation. Lobar deposition characterizes the dominance of coarse particles deposited in the right lower lobe, whereas the left upper-lower and right lower lobes simultaneously occupy high deposition rates for ultrafine particles. Finally, the results indicate a higher deposition in the right lung compared to its counterpart. Conclusions: From the results, the developed realistic human respiratory system down to the terminal bronchiole in this study, in coupling with the CFPD method, delivers the accurate prediction of a wide range of particles in terms of particle dosimetry and visualization of site-specific in the consecutive respiratory system. In addition, the series of CFPD analyses and their results are to offer in-depth information on particle behavior in human bronchioles, which may benefit health risk assessment or drug delivery studies © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational fluid-particle dynamics; Human respiratory tract; Particle deposition; Tracheobronchial airway; Ultrafine-to-coarse particles","Behavioral research; Biological organs; Computational fluid dynamics; Computerized tomography; Deposition rates; Dosimetry; Health risks; Particle size analysis; Respiratory system; Risk assessment; Coarse particles; Computational fluid-particle dynamics; Health risk assessments; Human respiratory system; Human respiratory tract; Particles depositions; Tracheobronchial airway; Ultra-fines; Ultrafine; Ultrafine-to-coarse particle; Particle size; airflow; Article; breathing; bronchiole; bronchus; computational fluid dynamics; computer assisted tomography; dosimetry; flow rate; human; lower respiratory tract; lung lobe; lung ventilation; particle size; prediction; respiratory system; right lung; simulation; tracheobronchial tree; ultrafine particulate matter; upper respiratory tract; biological model; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; lung; respiratory function; Bronchioles; Computer Simulation; Humans; Lung; Models, Biological; Particle Size; Respiratory Physiological Phenomena; Respiratory System","","","The authors thank Mr. Kiyoshi Nakazawa for his financial assistance in conducting this study and insightful guidance.

This study used UAVs, geographic information systems (GIS), and deep learning technology to monitor corn growth performance across different management practices. Two experimental corn fields were divided into four plots to evaluate the effects of varying corn management practices (i.e., seeding schedule, planting depth, and fertilization method) on corn growth performance. RGB and MicaSense multispectral cameras were mounted on UAVs to collect corn field images. YOLOv5 was investigated for counting corn plants. Plant height, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Red-Edge Index (NDRE), plant density, and plant volume were mapped based on UAV images. Additionally, the Otsu thresholding method was evaluated as an automatic method for separating plant height, NDVI, and NDRE values from the background. YOLOv5 and Otsu thresholding were efficient and accurate for automatically counting corn plants and extracting corn plant heights as well as VIs, respectively. The emergence rates of corn seeds were 40%, 33%, 41%, and 62% in plots A, B, C, and D, respectively. Variations in corn field management practices significantly affected the emergence rate, with fertilizer application close to seeds emerging as the optimal practice for achieving higher emergence rates across experimental plots. This study used deep learning and UAV to provide precise information and valuable insights into corn field practices, which can help farmers optimize corn cultivation.

Root plasticity is one of the key traits that play important roles in plant adaptation under such conditions. In this study, two contrasting genotypes, KDML105 and IRAT109, were examined to quantify the expression of plasticity in root branching at different positions in the toposequence (TP) and in a flat topography with a hardpan, both without a groundwater table, and subjected to SMF. Results showed that KDML105 exhibited improved adaptation to SMF conditions due to its greater root system because of the promoted nodal root production and development of lateral roots in the upper soil layer (0 – 20 cm soil depth) along the TP and above the hardpan in a flat topography, which led to the maintenance of its stomatal conductance and dry matter production. IRAT109, on the other hand, did not express root plasticity in deep-rooting due to the absence of groundwater table, particularly in the upper TP, as well as branching ability above the hardpan in a flat topography, which resulted in less water uptake and reduced dry matter production under SMF. Overall, the results indicated that root plasticity in the upper soil layer could be an important trait for the adaptation of rice, both in a sloping TP without a hardpan or in a flat topography with a hardpan, experiencing SMF. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hardpan; rainfed lowland; rice; root plasticity; toposequence","","","","This research was funded by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 15H02644) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).","Banoc, Dionisio M., Dry matter production and root system development of rice cultivars under fluctuating soil moisture, Plant Production Science, 3, 2, pp. 197-207, (2000); Banoc, Dionisio M., Genotypic variations in response of lateral root development to fluctuating soil moisture in rice, Plant Production Science, 3, 3, pp. 335-343, (2000); Boling, Anita A., The effect of toposequence position on soil properties, hydrology, and yield of rainfed lowland rice in Southeast Asia, Field Crops Research, 106, 1, pp. 22-33, (2008); Cairns, Jill E., Influence of the soil physical environment on rice (Oryza sativa L.) response to drought stress and its implications for drought research, Field Crops Research, 121, 3, pp. 303-310, (2011); Fukai, Shu, Increased productivity of rainfed lowland rice cropping systems of the Mekong region, Crop and Pasture Science, 63, 10, pp. 944-973, (2012); Henry, Amelia, Variation in root system architecture and drought response in rice (Oryza sativa): Phenotyping of the OryzaSNP panel in rainfed lowland fields, Field Crops Research, 120, 2, pp. 205-214, (2011); Jia, Xucun, Greater lateral root branching density in maize improves phosphorus acquisition from low phosphorus soil, Journal of Experimental Botany, 69, 20, pp. 4961-14790, (2018); Jongdee, Boonrat, Improving drought tolerance in rainfed lowland rice: An example from Thailand, Agricultural Water Management, 80, 1-3 SPEC.

In Indonesia, housing development in cities continues rising in parallel with high urbanization rates. This study aims to determine the typical layouts of apartments in Indonesia through qualitative and quantitative building typological analyses. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted using the building drawing information constructed across Indonesia from 1986 to 2021. A total of 268 public apartments and 268 private apartments from several major cities were included in the datasets, respectively. As a result, six typical layouts for public apartments and thirteen typical layouts for private apartments were determined for both 1BR and 2BR units. Furthermore, four typical unit layouts from public and private apartments associated with building-scale classifications were proposed, respectively, as the base models for the current typical apartments in Indonesia. The results showed that Indonesian public apartments tended to sacrifice semi-open spaces, such as a wide corridor and an internal void space, to increase the size of units and the number of rooms. Meanwhile, most private apartments were constructed with double-loaded corridor systems without internal voids, which potentially cause poor natural ventilation. The proposed typical layouts will be useful for further building simulations as standard testing models, such as to determine the appropriate cooling techniques for low-carbon apartments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","apartment; building typology; Indonesia; Rusunawa; standard design; typical layout","","","","Funding text 1: This research was partially supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) in collaboration with JST and JICA (JST, JPMJSA1904), YKK AP Inc. and the Asahi Glass Foundation.

Many engineering techniques have been proposed and applied to treat oily wastewater, but limited studies have investigated low-cost and effective techniques using by-products and waste/scrap materials from the construction industry. Materials to treat oily wastewater are needed not only to mitigate environmental pollution but also to promote the reuse and recycling of industrial by-products, especially in developing countries. This study, therefore, examined the sorption capacity of dispersed oil in wastewater (dispersed soybean oil in water; initial oil concentrations, C<inf>i</inf> = 10–1000 mg/L; oil droplet size in water <2 μm) onto the hydrophobized/oleophilized autoclaved porous aerated concrete (AAC) grains made from waste scrap in Vietnam by using batch sorption tests in the laboratory. The AAC grains (sizes 0.106–0.25, 0.25–0.85, and 0.85–2.00 mm) were hydrophobized/oleophilized using oleic and stearic acids (coating concentrations of 1.0, 5.0, and 10 g/kg), and two sands (0.18–2.00 and 0.30–2.00 mm) were used as control samples. The results showed that the hydrophobized/oleophilized AAC grains had high sorption capacity for dispersed oil (i.e., high oil removal efficiency) compared to the control sands. Especially, the removal of AAC grains coated with stearic acid was >80% in high oil concentration solutions (C<inf>i</inf> = 100 and 1000 mg/L), indicating that the hydrophobized/oleophilized AAC grains have high potential as useful adsorbents to trap dispersed oil in oily wastewater. Moreover, adsorption isotherms were drawn to examine the sorption characteristics of dispersed oil onto AAC grains. For all tested samples, the sorption of dispersed oil increased linearly with increasing equilibrium concentration. The commonly used Langmuir model, on the other hand, did not capture the measured isotherms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC); dispersed oil; oily wastewater; sorption; Vietnam","","","","This research was supported by the project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

The mean concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs ranged from 0.76 ng m−3 to 50.2 ng m−3 and 6.07 pg m−3 to 1.95 ng m−3, respectively. The concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs in winter were higher than in summer, except for NPAHs in XT. We found the benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)/benzo[ghi]perylene (BgPe) ratio could effectively identify biomass burning in this study, in which a higher [BaP]/[BgPe] value indicates a greater effect of biomass burning on PAHs and NPAHs. The results indicated that atmospheric PAHs and NPAHs were mainly affected by motor vehicles (especially the unique motorcycles in Southeast Asia) in the summer in Hanoi. In winter, all sites were affected by the burning of rice straw to varying degrees, especially DA. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) in Hanoi was first determined through ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption. The results showed that residents in Hanoi faced high health risks, while females experienced higher health risks than males.

In severe cases, V. vulnificus invades the skeletal muscle tissue, where bacterial proliferation leads to septicemia and necrotizing fasciitis with high mortality. Despite this characteristic, information on metabolic changes in tissue infected with V. vulnificus is not available. Here, we elucidated the metabolic changes in V. vulnificus-infected mouse skeletal muscle using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). Metabolome analysis revealed changes in muscle catabolites and energy metabolites during V. vulnificus infection. In particular, succinic acid accumulated but fumaric acid decreased in the infected muscle. However, the virulence factor deletion mutant revealed that changes in metabolites and bacterial proliferation were abolished in skeletal muscle infected with a multifunctional-autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) mutant. On the other hand, mice that were immunosuppressed via cyclophosphamide (CPA) treatment exhibited a similar level of bacterial counts and metabolites between the wild type and MARTX mutant. Therefore, our data indicate that V. vulnificus induces metabolic changes in mouse skeletal muscle and proliferates by using the MARTX toxin to evade the host immune system. This study indicates a new correlation between V. vulnificus infections and metabolic changes that lead to severe reactions or damage to host skeletal muscle. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CE-TOFMS; host metabolomics; MARTX toxin; TCA cycle; Vibrio vulnificus","2 oxoglutaric acid; aconitic acid; amino acid; bacterial toxin; carbohydrate; citric acid; creatine; creatinine; cyclophosphamide; fumaric acid; interleukin 6; isocitric acid; macrophage inflammatory protein 2; malic acid; multifunctional autoprocessing repeat in toxin; nucleic acid; ornithine; pentose phosphate; succinic acid; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; virulence factor; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial count; bacterial load; bacterial survival; capillary electrophoresis; carbohydrate metabolism; catabolism; cell count; cell proliferation; citric acid cycle; controlled study; creatinine blood level; deletion mutant; hierarchical clustering; male; metabolome; metabolomics; mouse; mRNA expression level; muscle metabolism; muscle tissue; nonhuman; nucleic acid metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; pentose phosphate cycle; skeletal muscle; time of flight mass spectrometry; Vibrio cholerae; Vibrio mimicus; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Vibrio vulnificus infection; Western blotting; human; metabolism; microbiology; vibriosis; Bacterial Toxins; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Vibrio Infections; Virulence Factors","","2 oxoglutaric acid, 328-50-7; aconitic acid, 499-12-7, 5976-98-7; amino acid, 65072-01-7; citric acid, 126-44-3, 5949-29-1, 77-92-9, 8002-14-0; creatine, 57-00-1; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0, 6055-19-2; fumaric acid, 110-17-8, 142-42-7; isocitric acid, 320-77-4; malic acid, 149-61-1, 6915-15-7; ornithine, 70-26-8, 7006-33-9; pentose phosphate, 27710-24-3; succinic acid, 110-15-6; Bacterial Toxins; Virulence Factors","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant 20H01616 and JST SPRING grant JPMJSP2113, Japan.

However, the circulation of low-quality and counterfeit vaccines seriously affects human health and the reputation of real vaccine manufacturers (VMs) and increases the amount of fear concerning vaccination. In this study, we address this problem by developing a blockchain-based COVID-19 vaccine tracking system called “Vacchain”. Our Vacchain allows users (USERs) to track and trace the route of vaccines. We propose three mechanisms, namely, a system manager (SYS-MAN), a mutual agreement concerning vaccine ownership, and vaccine passports, to enhance the security and reliability of data recorded in the Vacchain ledger. We develop this system on the Substrate platform with the Rust language. Our implementation, evaluation, and analysis have shown that Vacchain can trace and track vaccines smoothly. In addition, data security and reliability are enhanced by the abovementioned three mechanisms. The proposed system is expected to contribute to preventing the spread of COVID-19. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain for healthcare; COVID-19 vaccine tracking; cryptography; decentralized vaccine management; Substrate platform","","","","This work was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under Strategic Basic Research Programs Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) under grant number JPMJPR20M6.","undefined; 15 People Face Charges in Connection to A Conspiracy with Fake Covid 19 Vaccine Cards Da Says; Tip of the Iceberg Interpol Says Fake Covid 19 Vaccines Were Smuggled Across Continents; undefined; Cryptography Mailing List, (2009); Sadeghi, Mahsa, Adopting distributed ledger technology for the sustainable construction industry: evaluating the barriers using Ordinal Priority Approach, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 7, pp. 10495-10520, (2022); Blockchain Consensus an Analysis of Proof of Work and Its Applications, (2017); Ppcoin Peer to Peer Crypto Currency with Proof of Stake, (2012); Gao, Sheng, T-PBFT: An EigenTrust-based practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm, China Communications, 16, 12, pp. 111-123, (2019); A Next Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform, (2014)","","MDPI","","","","","","2410387X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151067071"

Therefore, it is very important to identify the main cause of deterioration to plan the maintenance works. This study conducted a structural health assessment for an elevated line on the Hokuriku Expressway to evaluate the functional value of the target structure. Polarizing microscope observation of the specimens collected from the target slab confirmed that chloride attack was the main cause of the deterioration, and ASR was not detected. The reduction in the stiffness and load-bearing capacity of the objective bridge due to chloride attack was also studied and reported by comparing the result obtained from the vehicle running tests and numerical analysis. Long–term monitoring of the responses of the objective bridge due to moving load based on bridge weigh in motion (BWIM) was also evaluated for ordinary vehicles. Further, a steel corrosion mitigation method using a detachable sacrificial anode attached to the lower surface of the slab was applied. To contribute to efficient structural health monitoring approaches, a self-powered remote-monitoring system using a vibration energy harvester is introduced to the target bridge. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BWIM; Chloride attack; Corrosion mitigation; Damage detection; Real-time remote monitoring; Vibration energy harvester","Bridges; Chlorine compounds; Deterioration; Energy harvesting; Remote control; Silica; Structural health monitoring; Alkali-silica reaction; Bridge weigh in motion; Chlorides attacks; Corrosion mitigations; Corrosion monitoring system; Frost damage; Health assessments; Real-time remote monitoring; Self-powered; Vibration energy harvesters; Damage detection","","","This study was conducted with the support of the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research—KAKENHI (Project No. 19K04574); JST SPRING, Grant Number JPMJSP2135; Program for Building Regional Innovation Ecosystems of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT); and Kanazawa Maintenance and Service Center of Central Nippon Expressway Co., Ltd.

In response, government authorities plan to implement a wide range of AI-driven healthcare solutions. These include care robots that assist the physically handicapped or elderly, chatbots that provide anonymous online mental health consultation, and diagnostic software utilizing machine learning. Yet one of the most popular smart technologies to augment the nation's already overstrained and undermanned healthcare system is a little known but emerging emotional AI technologies, i.e., deep learning systems trained to read, classify, and respond to human emotions. These technologies are being sold on a commercial level not only to the public but also to rehabilitation centers, local hospitals, and senior citizen residences. Although the augmentation of healthcare services to intelligent machines may seem like a logical step in a country well-known for its long-standing affection toward robots, Japanese society is also known for its adherence to established social relations and traditional institutional practices, especially, in the realm of medical care. In order to gauge Japanese acceptance of emotion-sensing technology, we analyze a dataset of 245 visitors to clinics and hospitals in a typical suburban area in Japan using multiple linear regression. The results show that in general, senior and male patients perceive the emotional AI technology more negatively. For behavioral variables, patients' level of familiarity has positive correlations with attitudes toward emotional AI-based applications in private setting (β<inf>Familiarity_AttitudePri</inf>=0.346, p<0.001) and public setting (β<inf>Familiarity_PublicAttitude</inf>=0.297, p<0.001); while concern for losing control to AI has negative correlations with the attitudes' variables: private setting (β<inf>LosingControl_AttitudePri</inf>=−0.262,p=0.002) and public setting (β <inf>LosingControl_AttitudePub</inf>=-0.188, p=0.044). Interestingly, concerns over violation of privacy and discrimination are non-significant correlates, which contradict the emerging literature on this subject. We further contextualize the findings with insights afforded by an understanding of Japanese culture as well as the relevant literature on care robots in Japan. Finally, policy and education implications to promote emotional AI acceptance to the general and senior members of the society are provided. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI in Healthcare; Artificial intelligence (AI); Emotional AI (EAI); Japan; Japanese elderly patients","Behavioral research; Deep learning; Engineering education; Health care; Hospitals; Learning systems; Linear regression; Aging population; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence in healthcare; Artificial intelligence technologies; Cross-sectional surveys; Emotional artificial intelligence; Healthcare systems; Healthcare workers; Japan; Japanese elderly patient; Diagnosis; aging population; artificial intelligence; elderly care; health care; machine learning; mental health; software","","","Funding text 1: This study is part of the project “Emotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life” funded by JST -UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6 .

Knowledge of the genetic basis of limb organogenesis in bats has increased but little has been documented regarding the differences between limb organogenesis in bats and that of other vertebrates. We conducted embryological comparisons of the timelines of limb organogenesis in 24 bat species and 72 non-bat amniotes. In bats, the time invested for forelimb organogenesis has been considerably extended and the appearance timing of the forelimb ridge has been significantly accelerated, whereas the timing of the finger and first appearance of the claw development has been delayed, facilitating the enlargement of the manus. Furthermore, we discovered that bats initiate the development of their hindlimbs earlier than their forelimbs compared with other placentals. Bat neonates are known to be able to cling continuously with their well-developed foot to the maternal bodies or habitat substrates soon after birth. We suggest that this unique life history of neonates, which possibly coevolved with powered flight, has driven the accelerated development of the hindlimb and precocious foot. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bat; flight; limb development; neonate","bat; biological development; evolution; flight activity; life history; limb; neonate; animal; flying; forelimb; genetics; hindlimb; human; newborn; organogenesis; placental mammal; vertebrate; Animals; Chiroptera; Eutheria; Flight, Animal; Forelimb; Hindlimb; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Organogenesis; Vertebrates","","","This study was supported by grants from JSPS (grant nos 18KK0207, 18K19359, 18H04816, 21H02546, 21K19291 and 22KK0101) and JST (grant no.

Patients in older age groups with high viral load and severe immunologic response during acute infection are likely to develop chronic arthritis and severe joint pain. Currently, no antiviral drug is available. Previous studies suggested that a flavone derivative, 8-bromobaicalein, was a potential dengue and Zika replication inhibitor in a cell-based system targeting flaviviral polymerase. Here we characterized that 8-bromobaicalein inhibited chikungunya virus replication with EC<inf>50</inf> of 0.49 ± 0.11 µM in Vero cells. The molecular target predicted at viral nsP1 methyltransferase using molecular binding and fragment molecular orbital calculation. Additionally, oral administration of 250 mg/kg twice daily treatment alleviated chikungunya-induced musculoskeletal inflammation and reduced viral load in healthy adult mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the 250 mg/kg administration maintained the compound level above EC<inf>99.9</inf> for 12 h. Therefore, 8-bromobaicalein should be a potential candidate for further development as a pan-arboviral drug. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","8-bromobaicalein; chikungunya virus; Drug discovery; flavone derivatives; flavonoid; in vivo efficacy","8 bromobaicalein; antivirus agent; baicalein; flavone derivative; methyltransferase; nonstructural protein 1; unclassified drug; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral activity; area under the curve; arthritis; Article; chikungunya; controlled study; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug efficacy; drug half life; EC50; maximum plasma concentration; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; mouse; multiple drug dose; nonhuman; plasma concentration-time curve; single drug dose; time to maximum plasma concentration; Vero cell line; virus load; virus replication; volume of distribution; aged; animal; Arbovirus; Chikungunya virus; Chlorocebus aethiops; human; inflammation; physiology; Zika fever; Zika virus; Adult; Aged; Animals; Arboviruses; Chikungunya Fever; Humans; Inflammation; Mice; Vero Cells; Viral Load; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","baicalein, 491-67-8; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4","This work was mainly supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University (FF67), and Chulalongkorn University (RA66-025) to S.B.

The use of host plant resistance has potential to reduce damage caused by BPH. The heat tolerance japonica rice ‘Sagabiyori’, with superior grain quality and high soluble starch in the stem, is highly suscepti-ble to damage by BPH. Here, to enhance its BPH resistance, we developed seven near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying BPH2, BPH17-ptb, BPH32, BPH3, BPH17, BPH20, and BPH21 through marker-assisted selection and evaluated resistance to two BPH populations. Most lines were more resistant to the Hadano-1966 BPH population than Sagabiyori but were less effective against the highly virulent Koshi-2013 population. Never-theless, in antixenosis tests, Koshi-2013 settled less on all NILs than on Sagabiyori. In addition, adult mortal-ity and the percentage of fresh weight loss of lines carrying BPH17 and BPH3 indicated that these lines have higher resistance to Koshi-2013 than Sagabiyori. Current study revealed that BPH resistance of Sagabiyori became stronger by transferring BPH3 and BPH17 genes. Thus, BPH3 and BPH17 might be valuable for breeding programs to enhance BPH resistance of high grain quality rice varieties with heat tolerance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BPH resistance gene; marker-assisted selection; Nilaparvata lugens; NILs","","","","Funding text 1: We thank the staff of the Insect Pest Management Research Group, Kyushu Okinawa Agricultural Research Center, NARO, for rearing and providing the insect populations.

There are many native pig breeds in Vietnam, but their origins remain unclear. This study investigated maternal lineages using the D-loop region on mtDNA of 260 samples collected from native pigs in 20 provinces across Vietnam. The D-loop region of all samples was amplified and sequenced. We obtained 713 bp sequences of the D-loop region for each sample excluding the repeat region, and variants on this region were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. We detected 50 haplotypes from Vietnamese native pigs, with 27 novel haplotypes. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed two haplotype groups: one for the MTSEA group, frequently found in domestic pigs in the mountainous areas of Cambodia and Laos; and the D2 group, found in pigs originating from Chinese pigs. No European haplotype was found. Haplotypes in northeast Vietnam comprised only haplotypes of the D2 group, whereas in areas from the northwest mountains to the south, we found haplotypes belonging to both the D2 and MTSEA groups.

However, superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be magnetized and detected in the presence of a relatively large external magnetic field in which other low field sensors and flux concentrators cannot be used since those are saturated in the bias field. To overcome this problem, we made submicron-sized orthogonal magnetic tunnel junctions with an appropriate perpendicular anisotropy free layer. By applying a perpendicular external magnetic field, the magnetization in the magnetic free layer is brought into an unstable state. As a result, relatively high field sensitivity of 1.3%/Oe is achieved in the external field of about 975 Oe for the 300nm magnetic tunnel junction. By tilting the angle of the bias field of 10 degrees from film normal, the maximum sensitivity of 4.5%/Oe was obtained at 295 Oe. We also investigated the low-frequency noise generated by the sensor for their capability to detect weak low-frequency magnetic signals. Noise equivalent signal of the device is estimated to be about 235 nT/√Hz from 1/f noise measurements which is suitable for single superparamagnetic nanoparticles detection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","low frequency 1/f noise; magnetic noise; magnetic tunnel junctions; magnetoresistive sensors; weak field detection","Magnetic devices; Magnetic sensors; Magnetometers; Nanomagnetics; Spurious signal noise; Superparamagnetism; Tunnel junctions; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Bias field; Field detections; Low frequency (1/f) noise; Lower frequencies; Magnetic noise; Magnetic tunnel junction; Magneto resistive sensors; Magnetoresistive sensors; Superparamagnetic nanoparticles; Weak field detection; Magnesia","","","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the Vietnamese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) with grant number NDT.88.JP/20.

Although Rousettus has been regarded as the only pteropodid capable of echolocation using tongue clicks, recent evidence suggests that other species of pteropodids are also capable of echolocation using wing clicks. Studies on laryngeal echolocators suggest that delicate ear movements are essential for the echolocation behavior of bats and that the cervicoauricularis muscles play a critical role in such ear movements. In this study, we observed the gross anatomy of cervicoauricularis muscles in three species of pteropodids (Cynopterus sphinx, Eonycteris spelaea, and Rousettus leschenaultii) to examine whether ear muscle anatomy varies among pteropodids with different echolocation types and between pteropodids and laryngeal echolocating bats. We found that M. cervicoauricularis profundus originates from the nuchal crest in tongue-click echolocators (R. leschenaultii) and from the midline in wing-click echolocators (C. sphinx and E. spelaea). In general, tongue-click echolocation using high click rates is considered to be more sophisticated in terms of sonar performance than wing-click echolocation. M. cervicoauricularis profundus originating from the nuchal crest (CPNC) is not common in non-bat laurasiatherian mammals, but can be found in laryngeal echolocating bats. As it pulls the ear pinna caudally in the horizontal plane and increases the access to sound, CPNC found in R. leschenaultii and laryngeal echolocating bats may be a key characteristic of the sophisticated active echolocation behavior of bats. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","comparative anatomy; echolocation; evolution; skull","article; auricle; comparative anatomy; echolocation; flying fox; larynx; Laurasiatheria; muscle; nonhuman; Rousettus; skull; sound; tongue; wing; animal; bat; evolution; physiology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Chiroptera; Ear Auricle; Echolocation; Muscles","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

While rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans are capable of laryngeal echolocation, pteropodids lack this ability. Delicate ear movements are essential for echolocation behavior in bats with laryngeal echolocation. Caudal auricular muscles, especially the cervicoauricularis group, play a critical role in such ear movements. Previously, caudal auricular muscles were studied in three species of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but to our knowledge, there have been no studies on non-laryngeal echolocators, the pteropodids. Here, we describe the gross anatomy of the cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation in Cynopterus sphinx by using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography and 3D reconstructions of immunohistochemically stained serial sections. A previous study on bats with laryngeal echolocation reported that rhinolophoids have four cervicoauricularis muscles and yangochiropterans have three. We observed three cervicoauricularis muscles in the pteropodid C. sphinx. The number of cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation pattern were comparable to those of non-bat boreoeutherian mammals and yangochiropterans, suggesting that pteropodids, and yangochiropterans maintain the general condition of boreoeutherian mammals and that rhinolophoids have a derived condition.

However, the hypothesis that expanding rail transport networks and implementing TOD policies will improve urban accessibility in developing cities has not been sufficiently analyzed. Therefore, this study selected four Asian cities of various sizes under different stages of development to explore how the expansion of rail transport networks and implementation in high-density development of the three TOD policies affect urban accessibility. The results suggest that rail transit network expansion would significantly increase overall accessibility, and TOD policy implementation would further increase accessibility in all cities.

Understanding mortality risk factors is crucial for the clinical management of severe COVID-19. Methods We conducted a retrospective study at an intensive care center in Ho Chi Minh City that urgently built by Bach Mai Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam, when the Delta variant predominated. Participants were laboratory-confirmed patients with SARSCoV- 2 infection, admitted in August 2021. Data on patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, radiographic and laboratory findings, treatment, and clinical time course were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Risk factors to mortality were assessed using logistic regression. Results Among 504 eligible COVID-19 patients, case fatality was 52.2%. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 61.2% of non-survivors and 43.6% of survivors (p < 0.001). The time from onset to hospital admission was 8 days in non-survivors and 7 days in survivors (p = 0.004). Among non-survivors, 90.2% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygen therapy was administered for all patients, but antiviral agent was given to 51.7% of nonsurvivors. 54.2% of non-survivors tested positive for the bacterial infection using blood culture. The risk factors for mortality were diabetes mellitus, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, vaccination status, time from onset to admission, and older age. Conclusions Critical patients with COVID-19 owing to the Delta variant in Vietnam had delayed hospital admission, leading to ARDS and death. Early availability of vaccines and preventing bacterial infections are crucial for reducing mortality of COVID-19, especially in low- and middleincome countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","dexamethasone; remdesivir; abnormal laboratory result; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; aging; Article; blood culture; breathing rate; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; drug bioavailability; female; health center; hospital admission; human; laboratory diagnosis; logistic regression analysis; low income country; major clinical study; male; middle income country; mortality risk; nonhuman; observational study; oxygen saturation; oxygen therapy; pandemic; radiography; retrospective study; risk factor; risk reduction; SARS-CoV-2 (variant B.1.617.2/Delta/India/mutant D614G, P681R); survivor; therapy delay; time to treatment; vaccination; very elderly; Viet Nam; young adult; critical illness; epidemiology; respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; Critical Illness; Humans; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Vietnam","","dexamethasone, 50-02-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3","Funding:ThisworkwassupportedbytheToyota FoundationInitiativeprogram,TheJapanSociety ofthePromotionofScience(JSPS),aGrant-in-Aid forScientificResearch(KAKENHI,Promotionof JointInternationalResearchB,#20KK0218),anda grantfromJapanScienceandTechnology(JST), JST-MiraiProgram(#20345310).Initialsofthe","Weekly Epidemiological Update on Covid 19 12 October 2022; Manabe, Toshie, Spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 during the first 7 months of the epidemic in Vietnam, BMC Infectious Diseases, 21, 1, (2021); Coronavirus Disease Covid 19 Pandemic; Rosato, Adriana E., Rapid detection of the widely circulating B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 variant, Pathology, 54, 3, pp. 351-356, (2022); Del Rio, Carlos D., Confronting the Delta Variant of SARS-CoV-2, Summer 2021, JAMA, 326, 11, pp. 1001-1002, (2021); Coleman, Kristen K., Viral Load of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Respiratory Aerosols Emitted by Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) While Breathing, Talking, and Singing, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 74, 10, pp. 1722-1728, (2022); Butt, Adeel Ajwad, Severity of Illness in Persons Infected With the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant vs Beta Variant in Qatar, JAMA Internal Medicine, 182, 2, pp. 197-205, (2022); Nguyen, The Phuong, Rapid impact assessments of COVID-19 control measures against the Delta variant and short-term projections of new confirmed cases in Vietnam, Journal of Global Health, 11, (2021); Lauring, Adam S., Variants of SARS-CoV-2, JAMA, 326, 9, (2021); Asian Pacific Journal of Disease Management, (2010)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","36662716","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146642240"

Four biovars (Psa biovar 1; Psa1, Psa biovar 3; Psa3, Psa biovar 5; Psa5, and Psa biovar 6; Psa6) were reported in Japan, and virulent Psa3 strains spread rapidly to kiwifruit production areas worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop critical management strategies for bacterial canker based on dissecting the dynamic interactions between Psa and kiwifruit. To investigate the molecular mechanism of Psa3 infection, we developed a rapid and reliable high-throughput flood-inoculation method using kiwifruit seedlings. Using this inoculation method, we screened 3000 Psa3 transposon insertion mutants and identified 91 reduced virulence mutants and characterized the transposon insertion sites in these mutants. We identified seven type III secretion system mutants, and four type III secretion effectors mutants including hopR1. Mature kiwifruit leaves spray-inoculated with the hopR1 mutant showed significantly reduced virulence compared to Psa3 wild-type, indicating that HopR1 has a critical role in Psa3 virulence. Deletion mutants of hopR1 in Psa1, Psa3, Psa5, and Psa6 revealed that the type III secretion effector HopR1 is a major virulence factor in these biovars. Moreover, hopR1 mutants of Psa3 failed to reopen stomata on kiwifruit leaves, suggesting that HopR1 facilitates Psa entry through stomata into plants. Furthermore, defense related genes were highly expressed in kiwifruit plants inoculated with hopR1 mutant compared to Psa wild-type, indicating that HopR1 suppresses defense-related genes of kiwifruit. These results suggest that HopR1 universally contributes to virulence in all Psa biovars by overcoming not only stomatal-based defense, but also apoplastic defense. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bacterial canker of kiwifruit canker; HopR1; Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae; stomatal-based defense; type three secretion system","","","","This research was funded by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) NOMURA Microbial Community Control Project, grant number JPMJER1502 and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, grant number 19K06045 and 21J10765.","Mansfield, John W., Top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology, Molecular Plant Pathology, 13, 6, pp. 614-629, (2012); Xin, Xiufang, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000: A model pathogen for probing disease susceptibility and hormone signaling in plants, Annual Review of Phytopathology, 51, pp. 473-498, (2013); Scortichini, Marco, Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae: A re-emerging, multi-faceted, pandemic pathogen, Molecular Plant Pathology, 13, 7, pp. 631-640, (2012); Annals of the Phytopathological Society of Japan, (1989); Fujikawa, T., Genome analysis of the kiwifruit canker pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 5, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Fujikawa, T., Genome analysis of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 6, which produces the phytotoxins, phaseolotoxin and coronatine, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Cameron, Alan James, Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae: Chemical control, resistance mechanisms and possible alternatives, Plant Pathology, 63, 1, pp. 1-11, (2014); J Gen Plant Pathol, (2002); Annals of the Phytopathological Society of Japan, (1989); New Zealand Plant Protection, (2003)","","MDPI","","","","","","22237747","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145860368"

Surgical interventions are known to provide acceptable functional and cosmetic results; however, the long-term post-surgery outcome is not well known. In silico analysis provides an objective measure to quantify the respiratory function in postoperative dogs which is critical for successful long-term outcomes. A virtual surgery to open the airway can explore the ability for improved breathing in an obstructed airway of a patient dog, thus supporting surgeons in pre-surgery planning using computational fluid dynamics. Methods: In this study five surgical interventions were generated with a gradual increment of decongested levels in a bulldog based on computed tomography images. The effects of the decongested airways on the breathing function of a patient bulldog, i.e., airflow characteristics, pressure drop, wall shear stress, and air-conditioning capacity, were quantified by benchmarking against a clinically healthy bulldog using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Results: Our findings demonstrated a promising decrease in excessive airstream velocity, pressure drop, and wall shear stress in virtual surgical scenarios, while constantly preserving adequate air-conditioning efficiency. A linear fit curve was proposed to correlate the reduction in the pressure drop and decongested level. Conclusions: The in silico analysis is a viable tool providing visual and quantitative insight into new unexplored surgical techniques. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS); Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Decongested trial effects; French bulldogs; Impaired breathing function; Virtual surgery","Air; Air conditioning; Computerized tomography; Drops; Pressure drop; Shear flow; Shear stress; Surgery; Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome; Breathing function; Computational fluid dynamic; Decongested trial effect; French bulldog; Impaired breathing function; In-silico; Silico analysis; Surgical interventions; Virtual surgery; Computational fluid dynamics; adult; air conditioning; airflow; airway; article; benchmarking; breathing; bulldog; computational fluid dynamics; computer assisted tomography; computer model; controlled study; dog; human; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; shear stress; surgeon; surgical technique; animal; health status; Animals; Dogs; Health Status","","","The computation was carried out using the computer resources offered under the category of Intensively Promoted Projects by the Research Institute for Information Technology, Kyushu University.

Among various methods of joining dissimilar materials, adhesive bonding has the advantage of being low weight. It is necessary to understand the failure criteria of adhesives in choosing the most preferable adhesive for improving the strength of a bonded structure. Experiments using pipe specimens with inclined surfaces bonded by epoxy adhesive were performed, whereby multiaxial stress states were realized simply by conducting a uniaxial tensile test. The failure function of the epoxy adhesive, expressed by the mean stress and octahedral shear stress, was then obtained from the experimental data and compared with that of acrylic adhesive previously reported in the literature. The obtained failure functions of both adhesives were then applied to the shape optimization of the adhesive layer under different loading conditions. The optimization object is the strengthening of bonded structures. The optimal shape for different loading conditions differed for the different adhesives because of the driving force generated by the applied stress. The final shapes were thus optimized numerically to attain the highest mechanical integrity of the adhesive layer and found to be strongly dependent on the initial shapes before optimization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acrylic adhesive; Adhesive; epoxy adhesive; failure criterion; multiaxial stress state; shape optimization","Adhesive joints; Dissimilar materials; Failure (mechanical); Shape optimization; Shear stress; Stress analysis; Structural optimization; Tensile testing; Acrylic adhesives; Adhesive layers; Bonded structure; Epoxy adhesives; Failure criteria; Loading condition; Multi materials; Multiaxial stress state; Optimisations; Shape-optimization; Adhesives; Failure; Loading; Materials; Optimization; Shape; Shear Stress; Stress Analysis","","","Funding text 1: The authors sincerely thank Yoshiki Yamauchi (Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) for assisting the present research and Akoo Mechanical Engineering Co., Ltd. for providing the pipe specimens.

Various biosensors using the unique optical responses of SWNTs have been proposed by many research groups. Most of these employed either colloidal suspensions of dispersed SWNTs or SWNT films on flat surfaces, such as electrodes. In this study, we attached DNA-wrapped SWNTs (DNA-SWNTs) to frustule (micron-sized nanoporous biosilica) surfaces, which were purified from cultured isolated diatoms. After the injection of an oxidant and a reductant, the SWNTs on the frustules showed prominent PL responses. This suggests that the biodevice functions as a micron-sized redox sensor. Frustules can be easily suspended in aqueous solutions because of their porous structures and can easily be collected as pellets by low-speed centrifugation. Thus, the removal of unbound SWNTs and the recovery of the fabricated DNA-SWNT frustules for reuse were achieved by gentle centrifugation.

As a test sample, we used diatom frustules (Nitzschia sp.) as the target objects. In the generally used sample preparation method, the frustule suspension is added dropwise onto a glass substrate or into a glass chamber. While our work confirms good observation of purified frustules using the typical sample preparation method, we also demonstrate a new procedure to observe unseparated structures of frustules prepared by baking them on a mica surface. The baked frustules on the mica surface were transferred to a glass chamber with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution. In this manner, the unseparated structures of the diatom frustules were clearly observed. Furthermore, metal-coated frustules prepared by sputtering onto them on a mica surface were also clearly observed using the same procedure. Our method can be applied for the observation of any target object that is pretreated on a solid surface. We expect our proposed method to be a basis for establishing DHM techniques for microscopic observations of biomaterials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anneal; diatom; digital holographic microscope; frustule; mica; sputtering","","","","This study was financially supported by JST SICORP Japan (grant number JPMJSC19E1).","Baczewska, Maria, Refractive Index Changes of Cells and Cellular Compartments Upon Paraformaldehyde Fixation Acquired by Tomographic Phase Microscopy, Cytometry Part A, 99, 4, pp. 388-398, (2021); Belashov, Andrey V., Determination of the refractive index of dehydrated cells by means of digital holographic microscopy, Technical Physics Letters, 43, 10, pp. 932-935, (2017); Bianco, Vittorio, Identification of Microplastics Based on the Fractal Properties of Their Holographic Fingerprint, ACS Photonics, 8, 7, pp. 2148-2157, (2021); Bohannon, Kevin Patrick, Refractive Index Imaging of Cells with Variable-Angle Near-Total Internal Reflection (TIR) Microscopy, Microscopy and Microanalysis, 23, 5, pp. 978-988, (2017); Cotte, Yann, Marker-free phase nanoscopy, Nature Photonics, 7, 2, pp. 113-117, (2013); Doblas, Ana, Diabetes screening by telecentric digital holographic microscopy, Journal of Microscopy, 261, 3, pp. 285-290, (2016); Donnarumma, Dario, Blood flow imaging in zebrafish by laser doppler digital holography, Microscopy Research and Technique, 81, 2, pp. 153-161, (2018); Donnarumma, Dario, High-speed quantitative 3D imaging by dual-illumination holographic microscopy, Microscopy Research and Technique, 81, 12, pp. 1361-1365, (2018); Frómeta, Magalee R., Optimized setup for integral refractive index direct determination applying digital holographic microscopy by reflection and transmission, Optics Communications, 387, pp. 252-256, (2017); Funamizu, Hideki, Three-dimensional quantitative phase imaging of blood coagulation structures by optical projection tomography in flow cytometry using digital holographic microscopy, Journal of Biomedical Optics, 24, 3, (2019)","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","14319276; 14358115","","MIMIF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142289064"

Nocardia farcinica NBRC 15,532, a gram-positive rubber-degrading bacterium, can utilize poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) as the sole source of carbon and energy to produce oligo-isoprene metabolites containing aldehyde and keto end groups. A homology-based search of the genome revealed a gene encoding a latex-clearing protein (Lcp). Gene disruption analysis indicated that this gene is essential for the utilization of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in this strain. Further analysis of the genome sequence identified aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes as potential candidates for oxidative degradation of oligo-isoprene aldehydes. Based on the enzymatic activity of the ALDH candidates, NF2_RS14000 and NF2_RS14385 may be involved in the degradation of oligo-isoprene aldehydes. Analysis of the reaction products revealed that these ALDHs oxidized tri- to penta-isoprene aldehydes, which were generated by the reaction of Lcp. Based on the inability of ALDH gene deletion mutants, we concluded that NF2_RS14000 is mainly involved in the utilization of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) and the oxidative degradation of oligo-isoprene aldehydes in Nocardia farcinica NBRC 15,532. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","aldehyde dehydrogenase; latex-clearing protein; Nocardia farcinica; poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) utilization","","","","This work was supported by JST-Mirai Program Grant Number JPMJMI19E6 from the Japan Science and Technology Agency, and the Moonshot Research and Development Program of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, Japan.","Backhaus, Ralph Andrew, Rubber formation in plants — A mini-review, Israel Journal of Botany, 34, 2-4, pp. 283-293, (1985); Nayanashree, G., Biodegradation of Natural Rubber by Laccase and Manganese Peroxidase Enzyme of Bacillus subtilis, Environmental Processes, 2, 4, pp. 761-772, (2015); Bode, Helge Björn, Bacterial degradation of natural and synthetic rubber, Biomacromolecules, 2, 1, pp. 295-303, (2001); Yikmis, Meral, Historical and recent achievements in the field of microbial degradation of natural and synthetic rubber, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 78, 13, pp. 4543-4551, (2012); Braaz, Reinhard, Novel type of heme-dependent oxygenase catalyzes oxidative cleavage of rubber (poly-cis-1,4-isoprene), Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 70, 12, pp. 7388-7395, (2004); Bröker, Daniel, The genomes of the non-clearing-zone-forming and natural-rubber-degrading species Gordonia polyisoprenivorans and Gordonia westfalica harbor genes expressing Lcp activity in Streptomyces strains, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 74, 8, pp. 2288-2297, (2008); Yikmis, Meral, Secretion and transcriptional regulation of the latex-clearing protein, Lcp, by the rubber-degrading bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain K30, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 74, 17, pp. 5373-5382, (2008); Hiessl, Sebastian, Involvement of two latex-clearing proteins during rubber degradation and insights into the subsequent degradation pathway revealed by the genome sequence of Gordonia polyisoprenivorans strain VH2, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 78, 8, pp. 2874-2887, (2012); Luo, Quan, Insights into the microbial degradation of rubber and gutta-percha by analysis of the complete genome of Nocardia nova SH22a, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 80, 13, pp. 3895-3907, (2014); Watcharakul, Sirimaporn, Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of purified Latex Clearing Protein (Lcp) from newly isolated rubber degrading Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain RPK1 reveals novel properties of Lcp, BMC Microbiology, 16, 1, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20762607","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144730407"

Here, we demonstrate that, compared to other breeds, VnPs have fewer copies of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), which pose a risk for xenotransplantation of pig organs to humans. More specifically, we sought to characterize non-reference PERVs (nrPERVs) that were previously unidentified in the reference genome. To this end, we used whole-genome sequencing data to identify nrPERV loci with long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences in VnPs. RetroSeq was used to estimate nrPERV loci based on the most current porcine reference genome (Sscrofa11.1). LTRs were detected using de novo sequencing read assembly near the loci containing the target site duplication sequences in the inferred regions. A total of 21 non-reference LTR loci were identified and separated into two subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, PERVs within the detected LTR loci were identified, the presence of which was confirmed using conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing. These novel loci represent previously unknown PERVs as they have not been identified in the porcine reference genome. Thus, our RetroSeq method accurately detects novel PERV loci, and can be applied for development of a useful biomedical model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","animal; Asian; endogenous retrovirus; Gammaretrovirus; genetics; human; long terminal repeat; phylogeny; pig; xenograft; Animals; Asians; Endogenous Retroviruses; Humans; Phylogeny; Swine; Terminal Repeat Sequences; Transplantation, Heterologous","","","This study was funded in part by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS; No. JPMJSA1404) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JST/JICA) and by Accelerating Social Implementation for SDGs Achievement (aXis; No. JPMJAS2006) from JST.

In this study, nipa sap was successfully fermented to acetic acid by the industrially important Moorella thermoacetica without additional trace metals, without inorganics, or without yeast extract. Although microbial growth kinetics differed from one nutrient condition to another, acetic acid concentrations obtained without trace metals, without inorganics, and without yeast extract supplements were in the same range as that with full nutrient, confirming that nipa sap is a good nutrient source for M. thermoacetica. Fermentations in vials and fermenters showed comparable acetic acid production trends but acetic acid concentrations were higher in fermenters. Upon economic analysis, it was found that the most profitable nutrient condition was without yeast extract. It reduced the cost of culture medium from $1.7 to only $0.3/L, given that yeast extract costs $281/kg, while nipa sap can be available from $0.08/kg. Minimal medium instead of the traditional complex nutrient simplifies the process. This work also opens opportunities for profitable anaerobic co-digestion and co-fermentation of nipa sap with other biomass resources where nipa sap will serve as an inexpensive nutrient source and substrate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acetic acid; minimal media; Moorella thermoacetica (f.

At the same time, the region is facing various challenges, ranging from extreme weather events, saline water intrusion, and other anthropogenic pressures. This study examines how saline water intrusion and drought have affected rice yield in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Applying the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the maximum and minimum values of annual average salinity, we spatially examine the effects of drought and saline water intrusion on rice yields over a 40-year period (1980–2019). Our results highlight that 42% of the natural land area of the VMD has experienced increased drought occurrence during the winter-spring (WS) rice cropping season, while certain inland regions have additionally experienced increased drought occurrence during the summer-autumn (SA) rice cropping season. The Tri Ton Station, which has a significant Sen’s slope of −0.025 and a p-value of 0.05, represents an upstream semi-mountainous part of the delta, indicative of a rising severity of reoccurring drought. It should be noted that the yield decreases during the summer-autumn season as the positive SPI_SA increases. Salinity, on the other hand, is associated with SPI_WS during the winter-spring season. Our results highlight the need for improved evidence-based planning and investments in priority adaptation for both sustainable water infrastructure and to improve system resilience. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adaptation; drought; Mekong Delta; rice yield; saline water intrusion; Standardized Precipitation Index","Investments; Saline water; Water conservation; Adaptation; Cropping seasons; Extreme weather events; Growing regions; Mekong Delta; Rice yield; Saline water intrusion; Standardized precipitation index; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Drought; crop yield; cropping practice; drought; extreme event; livelihood; saline intrusion","","","This research work is partly funded by the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training (research code: B2021-TCT-13).

We introduce a new genus and species, Triadoleucella meensis, for these specimens that represent the oldest known member of the order Ophioleucida. The ophiuroids were found in mudstones deposited in outer shelf environments below storm wave base. The intact articulation, combined with random orientation and intense fragmentation of individuals suggest effective burial by downslope mudflow prior to or soon after death. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Me area; new taxa; Ninh Binh Province; paleoenvironment; Suoi Bang Formation; taphonomy","","","","We wish to thank Hung Ba Nguyen (Vietnam National Museum of Nature, Hanoi) for his assistance in the geological survey.

Good seedling root development will be crucial to cope with the combined effects of low P and water availability. Upland rice genebank accession DJ123 was used as a donor for P efficiency and root vigor traits in a cross with inefficient local variety Nerica4 and a set of backcross lines were used to characterize the seedling stage response of upland rice to low P availability and to identify associated QTL in field trials in Japan and Madagascar. Ten QTL were detected for crown root number, root, shoot and total dry weight per plant in a highly P deficient field in Japan using the BC<inf>1</inf>F<inf>3</inf> generation. Of these, qPef9 on chromosome 9 affected multiple traits, increasing root number, root weight and total biomass, whereas a neighboring QTL on chromosome 9 (qPef9-2) increased shoot biomass. Field trials with derived BC<inf>1</inf>F<inf>5</inf> lines in a low-P field in Madagascar confirmed a highly influential region on chromosome 9. However, qPef9-2 appeared more influential than qPef9, as the shoot and root biomass contrast between lines carrying DJ123 or Nerica4 alleles at qPef9-2 was +23.8% and +13.5% compared to +19.2% and +14.4% at qPef9. This advantage increased further during the growing season, leading to 46% higher shoot biomass at the late vegetative stage. Results suggest an introgression between 8.0 and 12.9 Mb on chromosome 9 from P efficient donor DJ123 can improve plant performance under P-limited conditions. The QTL identified here have practical relevance because they were confirmed in the target genetic background of the local variety Nerica4 and can therefore be applied directly to improve its performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crop establishment; crown root number; NERICA; phosphorus deficiency; seedling vigor","","","","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)—Grant No. JPMJSA1608.","Alewell, C., Global phosphorus shortage will be aggravated by soil erosion, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Sust Agric Res, (2015); Baird, Nathan A., Rapid SNP discovery and genetic mapping using sequenced RAD markers, PLOS ONE, 3, 10, (2008); Bolger, Anthony M., Trimmomatic: A flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data, Bioinformatics, 30, 15, pp. 2114-2120, (2014); Bradbury, Peter J., TASSEL: Software for association mapping of complex traits in diverse samples, Bioinformatics, 23, 19, pp. 2633-2635, (2007); Broman, Karl W., R/qtl: QTL mapping in experimental crosses, Bioinformatics, 19, 7, pp. 889-890, (2003); Courtois, Brigitte, Locating QTLs controlling constitutive root traits in the rice population IAC 165 x Co39, Euphytica, 134, 3, pp. 335-345, (2003); Daněček, Petr, The variant call format and VCFtools, Bioinformatics, 27, 15, pp. 2156-2158, (2011); Gamuyao, Rico, The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency, Nature, 488, 7412, pp. 535-539, (2012); Gonzalez, Daniel, Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Upland-Rice Root Architecture in Relation to Phosphate: 3D Simulations Highlight the Importance of S-Type Lateral Roots for Reducing the Pay-Off Time, Frontiers in Plant Science, 12, (2021)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","1664462X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141406252"

However, the effects of ethanol application on increased drought tolerance in woody plants, such as the tropical crop “cassava,” remain unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses of cassava plants subjected to ethanol pretreatment and subsequent drought stress treatment. Ethanol pretreatment induced a slight accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and stomatal closure, resulting in a reduced transpiration rate, higher water content in the leaves during drought stress treatment and the starch accumulation in leaves. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ethanol pretreatment upregulated the expression of ABA signaling-related genes, such as PP2Cs and AITRs, and stress response and protein-folding-related genes, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs). In addition, the upregulation of drought-inducible genes during drought treatment was delayed in ethanol-pretreated plants compared with that in water-pretreated control plants. These results suggest that ethanol pretreatment induces stomatal closure through activation of the ABA signaling pathway, protein folding-related response by activating the HSP/chaperone network and the changes in sugar and starch metabolism, resulting in increased drought avoidance in plants. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cassava; Drought avoidance; Ethanol; Stomatal closure; Sugar and starch metabolism","abscisic acid; alcohol; carbohydrate; heat shock protein; plant protein; starch; water; drought; gene expression regulation; genetics; Manihot; metabolism; physiological stress; Abscisic Acid; Droughts; Ethanol; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Heat-Shock Proteins; Plant Proteins; Starch; Stress, Physiological; Sugars; Water","","abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; alcohol, 64-17-5; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; water, 7732-18-5; Abscisic Acid; Ethanol; Heat-Shock Proteins; Plant Proteins; Starch; Sugars; Water","This work was supported by grants from RIKEN, Japan (to MS), including the RIKEN\u2013AIST Joint Research Fund (full research), Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (JPMJCR13B4 to MS), and A-STEP (JPMJTM19BS to MS) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan (Innovative Areas 18H04791 and 18H04705 to MS).","Aina, Olufemi O., Effect of soil moisture stress on growth and yield of cassava in Nigeria, Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences, 10, 18, pp. 3085-3090, (2007); Bashir, Khurram, Ethanol-Mediated Novel Survival Strategy against Drought Stress in Plants, Plant and Cell Physiology, 63, 9, pp. 1181-1192, (2022); Bhaskara, Govinal Badiger, Unique drought resistance functions of the highly ABA-induced clade a protein phosphatase 2Cs, Plant Physiology, 160, 1, pp. 379-395, (2012); Afr Crop Sci Conf Proceed, (2013); Clément, Mathilde, The cytosolic/nuclear HSC70 and HSP90 molecular chaperones are important for stomatal closure and modulate abscisic acid-dependent physiological responses in arabidopsis, Plant Physiology, 156, 3, pp. 1481-1492, (2011); El-Sharkawy, Mabrouk A., Cassava biology and physiology., Plant Molecular Biology, 56, 4, pp. 481-501, (2004); El-Sharkawy, Mabrouk A., Physiological characteristics of cassava tolerance to prolonged drought in the tropics: Implications for breeding cultivars adapted to seasonally dry and semiarid environments, Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology, 19, 4, pp. 257-286, (2007); Fu, Lili, Physiological investigation and transcriptome analysis of polyethylene glycol (Peg)-induced dehydration stress in Cassava, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 17, 3, (2016); Guttikonda, Satish Kumar, Overexpression of AtDREB1D transcription factor improves drought tolerance in soybean, Molecular Biology Reports, 41, 12, pp. 7995-8008, (2014); van Ha, Chien, Positive regulatory role of strigolactone in plant responses to drought and salt stress, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 2, pp. 851-856, (2014)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15735028; 01674412","","PMBID","35969295","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135984929"

Asbestos or other fibers are still identified in residential environments due to the emission from asbestos-used building materials. The respiratory system is the primary route of asbestos exposure; under a longer residence time, asbestos-related adverse health effects are inevitable. Currently, asbestos fibers have been replaced with man-made vitreous fibers (MMVFs); however, studies have revealed some similar biological effects of MMVFs with asbestos. Therefore, MMVFs-induced diseases need to be determined by analyzing their deposition characteristics and foci in human respiratory tracts. In this study, we used computational fluid dynamics method to investigate fibers' airflow and deposition patterns in two realistic human respiratory models. Two drag models were used to predict the deposition of uniform 1 μm (asbestos) and 3.66 μm (carbon fiber-CF) diameter, 15–300 μm long fibers. Two drag models provided comparable results with the experimental data. Comparatively, asbestos deposition was independent of fiber length, while CF deposition increased proportionally to fiber length. The highest level of local deposition was detected in the anterior nasal cavity. The results obtained from this study can extend current knowledge of human vitreous fiber exposure-related lung diseases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","asbestos; computational fluid dynamics; drag force; human respiratory system; man-made vitreous fiber (MMVF)-like carbon fiber","Air; Asbestos; Carbon fibers; Deposition; Drag; Respiratory system; Asbestos fibers; Drag forces; Drag model; Fiber length; Human respiratory system; Human respiratory tract models; In-silico; Man-made vitreous fibers; Man-make vitreous fiber -like carbon fiber; Silico studies; Computational fluid dynamics","","","Funding text 1: This study was partially supported by Japan Science and Technology (JST), CREST Japan (grant Number JP 20356547), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research (Fostering Joint International Research (B)) (grant number JP 20KK0099).; Funding text 2: This study was partially supported by Japan Science and Technology (JST), CREST Japan (grant Number JP 20356547), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants\u2010in\u2010Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research (Fostering Joint International Research (B)) (grant number JP 20KK0099).","Riediker, Michael, Particle toxicology and health - Where are we?, Particle and Fibre Toxicology, 16, 1, (2019); Cheng, Kuo Hsi, In vivo measurements of nasal airway dimensions and ultrafine aerosol deposition in the human nasal and oral airways, Journal of Aerosol Science, 27, 5, pp. 785-801, (1996); Cheng, Yungsung, Nasal Deposition of Ultrafine Particles in Human Volunteers and Its Relationship to Airway Geometry, Aerosol Science and Technology, 25, 3, pp. 274-291, (1996); Hsu, Der Jen, In-vivo measurements of micrometer-sized particle deposition in the nasal cavities of Taiwanese adults, Aerosol Science and Technology, 46, 6, pp. 631-638, (2012); Cheng, Kuo Hsi, Deposition of ultrafine aerosols in the head airways during natural breathing and during simulated breath holding using replicate human upper airway casts, Aerosol Science and Technology, 23, 3, pp. 465-474, (1995); Cheng, Yungsung, Deposition of ultrafine aerosols in a human oral cast, Aerosol Science and Technology, 12, 4, pp. 1075-1081, (1990); Kelly, James T., Particle deposition in human nasal airway replicas manufactured by different methods.

Face-to-face interview methods were used to investigate the current status of construction and demolition waste (CDW) management (collection, transportation, treatment, and storage) as well as reveal attitudes of governmental agencies and enterprises towards CDW recycling and recycled material products in Hai Phong City, Vietnam. Waste generation rates (WGRs) of the works were also determined by site surveys and as-built drawings method of typical old buildings to be demolished and two licensed new construction works. WGRs of 34.5 kg/m2 and 758 kg/m2 were identified during the construction and demolition of small private houses, respectively, while WGRs at public house demolition sites were 1053 kg/m2. To effectively manage the CDW, the gross floor area of new construction work was estimated by a multiple regression equation with the population and gross region domestic product growth.

To accomplish this purpose, a series of 1 g model experiments on slopes using Komaoka volcanic coarse-grained soils as materials was conducted with a spray nozzle and shaking table. In the experiments, shear strain, acceleration, pore water pressure, and saturation degree were monitored and measured to provide an understanding of the failure mechanism of the model embankment with different fine particle contents during post-rainfall earthquakes. The results show that the increase in the fines content of the volcanic soil reduces the permeability of the volcanic embankment but has no signif-icant effect on rainfall-induced slope failure until the shear strain is less than 6%.

The study aimed to explore an impact of urban emission from the HCMC downtown on the air quality at the downwind region. The urban outflow was characterized by higher concentrations of WSIs in PM<inf>2.5</inf> and their gaseous precursors even during the rainy months, and lower sea-salt fractions when compared to those observed under marine air masses. In PM<inf>2.5</inf>, SO<inf>4</inf>2− was the most dominant species accounting for approximately 50% of the total ion content, followed by NO<inf>3</inf>−, K+, and NH<inf>4</inf>+. SO<inf>4</inf>2− is mainly formed through gas-phase reactions especially under urban outflow when stronger oxidation capacity and higher levels of its precursors were observed. Based on Hysplit backward trajectories and concentration weighted trajectory analysis, it is found that the contribution of biomass burning to PM<inf>2.5</inf> potassium was elevated consistent with the effect of air masses originated from the equatorial Southeast Asia countries. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed very strong correlation among three components K+–Cl−–NO<inf>3</inf>−, indicating that secondary NO<inf>3</inf>− formation through heterogeneous process was heavily dependent on the presence of biomass burning aerosols. The findings imply that the sampling site is impacted by urban emission and can be adopted as the mix receptor site for air quality management in the HCMC metropolitan area, an emerging megacity in developing country. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass burning; Ho Chi Minh City; PM2.5; Urban outflow; Water-soluble ion","Air quality; Developing countries; Hierarchical systems; Ions; Phase interfaces; Quality management; Urban growth; Air mass; Biomass-burning; Gaseous precursors; Ho chi minh city; PM 2.5; Sea salts; Urban emissions; Urban outflow; Viet Nam; Water-soluble ions; Cluster analysis; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; biomass burning; concentration (composition); ion exchange; metropolitan area; particulate matter; urban area; Ho Chi Minh City","","","This research was partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency , the Japan International Cooperation Agency , and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS project entitled “Multi-Beneficial Measure for Mitigation of Climate Change in Vietnam and Indochina Countries by Development of Biomass Energy”).","Arai, Hironori, Greenhouse gas emissions from rice straw burning and straw-mushroom cultivation in a triple rice cropping system in the Mekong Delta, Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 61, 4, pp. 719-735, (2015); Openair Open Source Tools for the Analysis of Air Pollution Data, (2012); Sci Technol Dev J Nat Sci, (2018); Engling, Guenter, Assessing the regional impact of indonesian biomass burning emissions based on organic molecular tracers and chemical mass balance modeling, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 14, 15, pp. 8043-8054, (2014); Fang, Yanhua, Relative humidity and O3 concentration as two prerequisites for sulfate formation, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 19, 19, pp. 12295-12307, (2019); Farren, Naomi J., Chemical characterisation of water-soluble ions in atmospheric particulate matter on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 19, 3, pp. 1537-1553, (2019); Hanoi, (2020); Hai, Caodung, Effects of local, regional meteorology and emission sources on mass and compositions of particulate matter in Hanoi, Atmospheric Environment, 78, pp. 105-112, (2013); Hien, To Thi, Current status of fine particulate matter (Pm2.5) in vietnam’s most populous city, ho chi minh city, Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 19, 10, pp. 2239-2251, (2019); Hien, To Thi, Comprehensive volatile organic compound measurements and their implications for ground-level ozone formation in the two main urban areas of Vietnam, Atmospheric Environment, 269, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01698095","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126580947"

In this study, fluorouracil (FU), which is an anticancer agent and a quorum sensing (QS) inhibitor to some of the Gram-negative bacteria was found to inhibit methane production from sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions, as shown in a result where methane production in the presence of FU was eight times lower than the control (sewage sludge without FU). Whereas FU did not influence the hydrolysis process, in the acidogenesis/acetogenesis process, butyrate, and acetate accumulated in samples with FU. Also, in the methanogenesis process, FU remarkably inhibited methane production by acetoclastic methanogens rather than by the hydrogenotrophic ones. This result agreed with the result that growth and methane production of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A was inhibited in the presence of FU. However, the inhibitory effect of FU was high in the condition that both bacteria and archaea were active. It indicates that FU influences methanogens and bacteria in the process of methane fermentation. The analyses of microbial communities (bacteria and archaea) showed that the abundance ratio of the Firmicutes phyla is high, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens become dominant in the presence of FU. Conversely, the abundance of Spirochaetes significantly decreased under FU. The inhibition of methane production by FU was due to the growth inhibition of methanogenic archaea and the changes in the composition of the bacterial population. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic digestion; Fluorouracil; Methane production; Pollutant; Sewage sludge","Bacteria; Methane; Methanogens; Population statistics; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Volatile fatty acids; 5-fluorouracil; Anaerobic conditions; Anti-cancer agents; Archaeon; Bacterial interactions; Fluorouracil; Gram-negative bacteria; Methane production; Microbial consortium; Quorum-sensing inhibitors; Anaerobic digestion; 5 bromouracil; acetic acid; ampicillin; butyric acid; fluorouracil; hydrolase; penicillin G sodium; proteinase; RNA 16S; streptomycin sulfate; vancomycin; methane; abundance; anaerobic digestion; methanogenesis; sewage; acetogenesis; acidogenic fermentation; Article; bacterial growth; controlled study; DNA synthesis; Firmicutes; gas chromatography; Gram negative bacterium; growth inhibition; high performance liquid chromatography; high throughput sequencing; hydrogenotrophic methanogen; hydrolysis; methanogenic fermentation; Methanosarcina acetivorans; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial consortium; microbial diversity; monoculture; nonhuman; pH; pollutant; quorum sensing; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; sludge digestion; species richness; spirochete; anaerobic growth; archaeon; bacterium; bioreactor; microbiology; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Bioreactors; Sewage","","5 bromouracil, 51-20-7; acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1, 6131-90-4; ampicillin, 69-52-3, 69-53-4, 7177-48-2, 74083-13-9, 94586-58-0; butyric acid, 107-92-6, 156-54-7, 461-55-2; fluorouracil, 51-21-8; hydrolase, 9027-41-2; penicillin G sodium, 69-57-8; proteinase, 9001-92-7; streptomycin sulfate, 3810-74-0; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9; methane, 74-82-8; Fluorouracil; Methane; Sewage","The work was supported by a grant (No. JPMJAS 2004 ) of aXis program ( Accelerating Social Implementation for SDGs Achievement ) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency and a grant from Shorai Foundation for Science and Technology, Japan .

The estimated evapotranspiration during the pre- and post-thinning periods were 840 and 910 and 780 and 860 mm/year in the catchments K<inf>T</inf> and K<inf>C</inf>, respectively. According to a paired catchment analysis of estimated evapotranspiration, monthly evapotranspiration increased from 3 to 20 mm from June to December, while it decreased from 7 to 31 mm from January to May. The estimated annual and monthly evapotranspiration was compatible with the values monitored in the plot-scale interception, canopy transpiration, and ground surface evapotranspiration. Our findings showed that the decreases in evapotranspiration due to 50% thinning were similar or different in different methods of measurement when compared with thinning in the other catchments around the world.

It may cause several health problems in humans in addition to its damage to aquatic organisms and its adverse effects on the environment. Among the wastewater treatment techniques of heavy metals, adsorption is much favored due to its cost-effectiveness and easy availability, especially in developing countries in tropical and semi-tropical climate regions. Moreover, natural geo-adsorbents like laterite and its crushed grains can be adopted as an attractive alternative adsorbent in floatation and filtration water treatment systems. In this review, the application of natural and pre-treated laterite grains as a low-cost adsorbent was examined based on selected journal articles published during 1990–2020. This paper summarizes basic physical and chemical properties including surface charge and element compositions of tested samples, batch adsorption results including initial conditions, isotherm and kinetic models, and adsorption and thermodynamic parameters such as the maximum adsorption capacity, removal percentage, and Gibbs free energy that categorize the natural and pre-treated laterite grains. In addition, the results of some previous studies of column experiments and desorption/regeneration of adsorbed heavy metals are described together with prospects for future studies and the applicability of laterite in wastewater treatment for heavy metal remediation © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorbent; Adsorption; Heavy metals; Laterite; Wastewater treatment","","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by JST–JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership. for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 2: This research was supported by JST–JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership. for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701)","Undp Sgds Goals; American Journal of Water Resources, (2013); Nikagolla, Chandima, Using water quality and isotope studies to inform research in chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology endemic areas in Sri Lanka, Science of the Total Environment, 745, (2020); Kobya, Mehmet, Adsorption of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions by activated carbon prepared from apricot stone, Bioresource Technology, 96, 13, pp. 1518-1521, (2005); Abdolali, Atefeh, Application of a breakthrough biosorbent for removing heavy metals from synthetic and real wastewaters in a lab-scale continuous fixed-bed column, Bioresource Technology, 229, pp. 78-87, (2017); Ha, Chu Thi Thu, Accumulation of arsenic and heavy metals in native and cultivated plant species in a lead recycling area in Vietnam, Minerals, 9, 2, (2019); Afr J Environ Sci Technol, (2017); Li, Zhangtao, Zeolite-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron: New findings on simultaneous adsorption of Cd(II), Pb(II), and As(III) in aqueous solution and soil, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 344, pp. 1-11, (2018); Chan, Brenda K.C., Reverse osmosis removal of arsenic residues from bioleaching of refractory gold concentrates, Minerals Engineering, 21, 4, pp. 272-278, (2008); Ouhadi, Vahid Reza, Impact of carbonate on the efficiency of heavy metal removal from kaolinite soil by the electrokinetic soil remediation method, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 173, 1-3, pp. 87-94, (2010)","","GEOMATE International Society","","","","","","21862982; 21862990","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131438942"

However, impact of continuous dose of vanillin on treatment performance and microbial activities in MBR are still unknown. In this study, effects of vanillin on production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial community was investigated in lab-scale MBR under continuous dose of vanillin. Vanillin dose remarkably reduced membrane fouling in accordance with less development of cake layer. It was probably because bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components and became less adhesive by lower abundance of Xanthomonadaceae and Chitonophagaceae, which are known to produce viscous EPS and hydrophobic lipopolysaccharides. In addition, filtration resistance of cake layer was probably reduced by less contents of SMP and LB-EPS due to inhibition of Flavobacterium and Xanthomonadaceae, which are biofilm forming bacteria and EPS producers. These results suggest that interference to microbial activity by continuous dose of vanillin alters characteristics of sludge EPS, thus effectively mitigate biofouling in MBR. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioactive substances; Extracellular polymeric substances; Membrane bioreactor; Quorum sensing; Size-polarity matrix","","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists A (Grant No. 15H05535), Fostering Joint International Research (Grant No. 16KK0146), JST Mirai Program (Grant No. JPMJMI18DC) and Kurita Water and Environment Foundation.

This is the first report of cassava transformation in Asian elite varieties using friable embryogenic calli. Abstract: Agrobacterium-mediated cassava transformation via friable embryogenic calli (FEC) has enabled the robust production of transgenic cassava. So far, mostly the model cassava variety 60444 and African varieties have been transformed because of their good production and regeneration from embryogenic tissues. It is important to develop transformation methods for elite Asian cassava varieties to meet the changing needs in one of the world’s major cassava production areas. However, a suitable transformation method for the Asian elite variety Kasetsart 50 (KU50) has not been developed. Here, we report a transformation method for KU50, the cultivar with the highest planting area in Thailand and Vietnam. In cassava transformation, the preparation of FEC as the target tissue for transgene integration is a key step. FEC induction from KU50 was improved by using media with reduced nutrients and excess vitamin B1, and somatic embryo and plant regeneration optimized by manipulation of naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), and benzylamino purine (BAP). The transformation efficiency for KU50 was 22%, approximately half that of 60444 at 45%. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of genes related to cell-wall loosening was upregulated in FEC from KU50 compared with 60444, indicating that cell-wall production and assembly were disproportionate in the Asian variety. The transformation system for KU50 reported here will contribute to the molecular breeding of cassava plants for Asian farmers using transgenic and genome-editing technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian elite variety; Cassava; FEC; KU50; Transformation","Agrobacterium; genetic transformation; genetics; Manihot; transgene; transgenic plant; Plants, Genetically Modified; Transformation, Genetic; Transgenes","","","This work was supported by the following funding: Strategic Funds for the Promotion of Science and Technology, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Program for Advancing Strategic International Networks to Accelerate the Circulation of Talented Researchers, EIG CONCERT-Japan 4th Call under the Strategic International Research Cooperative Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST, JPMJSC16C4), the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) in collaboration with the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST, JPMJSA1508) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the grant from RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science (CSRS).

Flowering time is correlated with the expression patterns of MeFT1 and homologs of Arabidopsis GI, PHYA, and NF-Ys. Abstract: Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a tropical crop that is propagated vegetatively rather than sexually by seed. Flowering rarely occurs in the erect-type variety grown in Southeast Asia, but it is known that cassava produces flowers every year in mountainous regions. Data pertaining to the effect of environmental factors on flowering time and gene expression in cassava, however, is limited. The aim of the present study was to determine the kinds of environmental conditions that regulate flowering time in cassava and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The flowering status of KU50, a popular variety in Southeast Asia and late-branching type of cassava, was monitored in six fields in Vietnam and Cambodia. At non-flowering and flowering field locations in North Vietnam, the two FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-like genes, MeFT1 and MeFT2, were characterized by qPCR, and the pattern of expression of flowering-related genes and genes responsive to environmental signals were analyzed by using RNA sequencing data from time-series samples. Results indicate that cassava flowering was induced in the dry season in the mountain region, and that flowering time was correlated with the expression of MeFT1, and homologs of Arabidopsis GI, PHYA, and NF-Ys. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that floral induction in cassava is triggered by some conditions present in the mountain regions during the dry season. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cassava; Field transcriptome; Flowering; Manihot esculenta; MeFT1","plant protein; Arabidopsis; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; Manihot; metabolism; Southeast Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Proteins","","Plant Proteins","Funding text 1: The authors from AGI were supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Vietnam under decision No. 364/QD-BNN-HTQT.

To avoid depleting natural granular materials, recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) from construction and demolition waste are now commonly used as an alternative. The mechanical behavior of RCA used in road construction is highly influ-enced by field conditions such as traffic load and moisture variation. The particle breakage of RCA influences long-term pavement performance because it changes the RCA grading over time. How-ever, the effect of moisture content (m.c.) on mechanical behavior and particle breakage during compaction and cyclic loading is often neglected. The aims of the study were to investigate the mechanism of permanent deformation development due to moisture change, the breakage response of RCA in this process, and the assessment of existing permanent deformation prediction model. The results showed that initial m.c. effectively controlled the deformation of RCA; the permanent axial strain (εpa) was enhanced, and the breakage of coarse fraction (19~9.5 mm) under cyclic loading was reduced at higher levels of m.c. Based on the experimental results, a modified model for predicting εpa was proposed, incorporating a deviation factor induced by m.c. The model fitted the experimental data well, suggesting that it is useful to have a quantitative estimation of εpa of RCA with different m.c. under cyclic loading. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cyclic loading; moisture; pavement; permanent deformation; recycled concrete aggregates","breakage; compaction; cyclic loading; deformation; demolition; infrastructure planning; moisture content; pavement; road construction","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was partially supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on science, and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

A gram-positive rubber-degrading bacterium, Rhodococcus sp. strain RDE2, was isolated from the waste of a rubber-processing factory in Vietnam. This strain grew on natural rubber as a sole source of carbon and energy and produced oligo-isoprenoid metabolites containing aldehyde groups from poly(cis-1,4-isoprene). To identify the genes responsible for poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation, the complete genome sequence of this strain was determined. The complete genome sequence consists of a 5,715,406 bp chromosome and 6 plasmids (GenBank accession numbers AP025186.1 to AP025192.1) with an average GC content of 67.9%. The genome contains 5358 protein-coding sequences and 12 and 68 copies of rRNA and tRNA genes, respectively. Based on genome sequence analysis, the lcp gene (RDE2_08,770), responsible for the initial step of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation, was identified. The gene product obtained from Escherichia coli depolymerizes poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) to low-molecular-weight oligo-isoprenoids. The transcription of this gene is activated during the utilization of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in strain RDE2. The lcpR gene (RDE2_08,760), which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator, is located upstream of lcp. The lcpR gene product recognizes the promoter region of lcp. When the lcpR gene is deleted, the constitutive transcription of lcp is observed. Thus, it is inferred that the LcpR negatively regulates lcp transcription. These results strongly suggest that the lcp and lcpR genes are involved in poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) utilization in strain RDE2. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complete genome sequence; Natural rubber; Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene); Rhodococcus; TetR/AcrR-type transcriptional regulator","Biodegradation; Escherichia coli; Lipids; Metabolites; RNA; Rubber products; Waste treatment; Complete genome sequence; Complete genomes; Gene products; Genome sequences; Isoprenoids; Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene); Rhodococcus; Rhodococcus sp; Tetr/acrr-type transcriptional regulator; Transcriptional regulator; Transcription; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium isolation; controlled study; gene identification; gene product; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; lcpR gene; microbial degradation; nonhuman; plasmid; promoter region; RNA gene; Viet Nam; bioremediation; genetics; Gram positive bacterium; metabolism; 1,4-polyisoprene; bacterial protein; hemiterpene; latex; rubber; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber","","rubber, 9006-04-6; 1,4-polyisoprene; Bacterial Proteins; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber","Funding text 1: We are indebted to Prof. Dr. Seiichi Kawahara of Nagaoka University of Technology for the provision of natural rubber latex and DPNR.

Furthermore, residual stress engineering influences the film performance, especially in the planar technologies. For the TE Mg-doped CuCrO<inf>2</inf>-based materials, the limitations in achieving an outstanding figure of merit, ZT, arise from their characteristically low charge carrier mobility and high thermal conductivity. Herein, we propose a combination of defect engineering and stress engineering via heavy doping CuCr<inf>1-x</inf>Mg<inf>x</inf>O<inf>2</inf> with × = 0.15 at different deposition temperatures to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Combining the compressive residual stress with multiscale defects (point defects, grain boundaries, and nano-inclusions) significantly reduces the thermal conductivity (κ) to 0.44 W/mK. The σ of the films shows a remarkable enhancement because of point defects introduced via heavy doping. Notably, the compressive-stressed films exhibit higher ZT values, compared to the tensile-stressed films. As a result, an outstanding approximated ZT of 0.66 is observed in the compressive-stressed CuCr<inf>0.85</inf>Mg<inf>0.15</inf>O<inf>2</inf> films, overcoming the limitations of its ZT value observed for the past two decades. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Defect engineering; Delafossite Mg-doped CuCrO2 materials; High ZT; Low thermal conductivity; Residual stress","Carrier concentration; Carrier mobility; Chromium compounds; Copper compounds; Defect engineering; Grain boundaries; Magnesium compounds; Point defects; Semiconductor doping; Thin films; Delafossite mg-doped CuCrO2 material; Delafossites; Heavy doping; High ZT; Low thermal conductivity; Mg-doping; Stress engineering; Thermoelectric; Thin-films; Residual stresses","","","Hoang Van Dung was funded by Vingroup Joint Stock Company and supported by the Domestic Master/PhD Scholarship Programme of Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF), Vingroup Big Data Institute (VINBIGDATA), code VINIF.2020.TS.50.

In this study, a series of compaction, California bearing ratio, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and particle breakage tests of well– and poor–graded mixtures of recycled clay brick aggregates (RCBs) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) with maximum aggregate diameters of 19, 25, and 37.5 mm were carried out to examine the practical application of those mixtures to unbound roadbed materials in Vietnam. The experimental results suggest that the maximum amount of RCBs added to RCAs should be less than 30% when applied to unbound roadbed materials. In addition, it was found that the mixing proportions of RCBs and RCAs and the maximum aggregate diameter, gradation of aggregates, and initial moisture condition control the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Further, the particle breakage characteristics under compaction were carefully examined, and it was found that the percentage increment/decrement, as well as a newly introduced method of estimating the mixing proportions of RCAs and RCBs in the fine fraction (<2.36 mm), is effective in understanding the mechanism of particle breakage of RCA and RCB mixtures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","California bearing ratio (CBR); compaction; hydraulic conductivity; particle breakage; recycled clay brick aggregate; recycled concrete aggregate; road base and subbase","aggregate; breakage; concrete; hydraulic conductivity; road construction; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the JST?JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was supported by the JST–JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 3: Acknowledgments: This research was supported by JST-JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (No. JPMJSA1701).","Pratap, Vinay, Solid Waste Treatment: Technological Advancements and Challenges, pp. 215-231, (2021); Nguyen, Hoang Giang, Current management condition and waste composition characteristics of construction and demolition waste landfills in hanoi of vietnam, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 18, (2021); Singh, Pradeep Pratap, Solid waste management through the concept of zero waste, pp. 293-318, (2021); Nguyen, Van Dinh, Current status of construction and demolition waste management in Vietnam: Challenges and opportunities, International Journal of GEOMATE, 15, 52, pp. 23-29, (2018); Yazdani, M., Improving construction and demolition waste collection service in an urban area using a simheuristic approach: A case study in Sydney, Australia, Journal of Cleaner Production, 280, (2021); Asif, Muhammad, Life cycle assessment: A case study of a dwelling home in Scotland, Building and Environment, 42, 3, pp. 1391-1394, (2007); Agamuthu, Pariatamby, Challenges in sustainable management of construction and demolition waste, Waste Management and Research, 26, 6, pp. 491-492, (2008); Hoang, Ngoc Han, A review of construction and demolition waste management in Southeast Asia, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 22, 2, pp. 315-325, (2020); Norouzi, Masoud, Circular economy in the building and construction sector: A scientific evolution analysis, Journal of Building Engineering, 44, (2021); Lieder, Michael, Towards circular economy implementation: A comprehensive review in context of manufacturing industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 115, pp. 36-51, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129132418"

As of 2020, coal-fired power accounts for 49.3% of the total power supply in the electrical industry and leads to a large generation of coal ash every year. The amount can be expected to increase to up to 30 million tons according to the master plan for electricity development, with 52 coal-fired power plants expected to be in operation by 2030 and more than 422 million tons of coal ash being stored. In recent years, the management and recycling of coal ash have played an important role in economic and social development. Besides protecting the environment, coal ash is also widely used in construction. Based on survey results, thermal plants do not possess sufficient capacity for storage of coal ash, especially from small-scale and old plants (which face the risk of closure). It is recommended to improve the technical standards for handling, reuse, and recycling of coal ash and to establish a collaborative system and framework among enterprises, government, and research institutes to promote the effective reuse and recycling of coal ash in Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coal ash; Coal-fired power plant; Reuse and recycling; Treatment and disposal; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: This research was partially supported by JST– JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 2: This research was partially supported by JST-JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Synthesis Report on Socio Environmental Impacts of Coal and Coal Fired Power Plants in Vietnam, (2016); Moc Report on Summary of Implementation of Prime Minister Decision no 452 2017 Qd Ttg; Viet Nam Energy Partnership Group Technical Working Group 5 Energy Data and Statistics Report of the 5th Meeting; Thriveni, Thenepalli, Technological solutions for recycling ash slag from the Cao Ngan Coal Power Plant in Vietnam, Energies, 11, 8, (2018); Japan Coal Frontier Organization Jcoal, (2021); Live Together with Coal Ash and Dust, (2015); Vinh Tan 2 Coal Power Plant Cause Pollution in Binh Thuan Province, (2016); Decision no 428 2016 Qd Ttg on the Approval of Revisions to the National Power Development Plan from 2011 to 2020 with Visions Extended to 2030; Greening the Grid, (2021); Coal Ash Coal Combustion Residuals or Ccr, (2021)","","GEOMATE International Society","","","","","","21862982; 21862990","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128849802"

The Massive technology adoption program (AMTEC) is an example of Colombian rice production. Although all components of AMTEC have been approved to improve the rice yield in demo farms, these impacts, along with other factors under actual farm conditions, are unclear. Data were obtained from the 2016 National Rice Census data of 20,174 rice production units. This study determines the effects of each AMTEC technology and other agricultural factors on paddy rice yield under actual farm conditions using the multiple regression analysis with a backward stepwise method. The average paddy rice yield was 5.508 t ha−1 with a considerable variation across the whole country (0.110–12.187 t ha−1). The results showed that 69.47% of the variation in paddy rice yield was influenced by rice cultivation regions, farm size, technical assistance, applying chisel plow, having a ban, having an irrigation system, and the number of nitrogen fertilizer applications. Landplane, certified seeds, and drill sowing were the three components of the AMTEC program that contributed to an increase in rice yield. Notably, the paddy rice yield was 0.361 t ha−1 with an additional N fertilizer application or the farm under the irrigation system. It also increased from 0.404 to 0.362 t ha−1 for the farm that used drill sowing compared to the farm that used benchmark technologies. The results also showed that the farm that received technical assistance had a 0.150 t ha−1 compared to their counterparts who did not, and there was a significant difference among its sources. Therefore, to improve the rice yield, the above-mentioned multiple technologies should be widely disseminated. Additionally, the farms should receive technical assistance, particularly from private companies such as supply distributors or milling companies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AMTEC; Colombia; Farmers’ Adoption; Rice yield determinant","","","","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grand-in-Aid for Scientific Research?KAKENHI (JSPS KAKENHI) in 2019.

To evaluate the heat balance in paved surfaces and to select appropriate road construction materials that help suppress heat islands, an accurate understanding of heat transport parameters such as thermal conductivity (λ) and heat capacity (HC) is important. Recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste, including scrap construction materials and industrial by-products, are often used for road construction; however, λ and HC of recycled aggregates especially for roadbeds are not fully un-derstood. This study involved a series of laboratory tests to measure λ and HC of recycled concrete and clay brick aggregates (<40 mm) and their mixtures with autoclaved aerated concrete grains (<2 mm) under varied moisture conditions. The measured λ and HC increased with increasing volu-metric water content (θ). Closed-form models for estimating λ(θ) were proposed using normalized thermal conductivity (λe) and effective saturation (Se). The new λe(Se) models performed well for the measured data compared to previously proposed models and would be useful to evaluate λ of recycled aggregates for roadbed materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC); Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Heat capacity; Recycled aggregates; Thermal conductivity; Urban heat islands","aggregate; concrete; demolition; measurement method; numerical model; recycling; road construction; thermal conductivity","","","Funding: This research was supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science, and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

In this study, 54 open-dumping site soils collected from Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines, and Vietnam were analyzed for MP. Soil samples were also divided into light (floating) and heavy (sedimentation) fractions by density separation and analyzed for plastic additives. The highest abundance of MP was found in a soil from Cambodia at 218,182 pieces/kg. The median of MP in soils ranged from 1411 pieces/kg in India to 24,000 pieces/kg in the Philippines, suggesting that dumping sites are a major source of MP into the environment. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate were dominant polymers in soil samples analyzed. This indicates that daily-used plastic products are main sources of MP in dumping site soils in Asian countries. The high concentrations and burdens of phthalates and an antioxidant were detected in floating fraction accounting for 40 to 60% of the total additives in soils. Previous studies on soil pollution have assumed that the organic hydrophobic chemicals analyzed are adsorbed on the surface of soil particles. However, this result indicates that approximately half of the additives in dumping site soils were derived from MP, not soil particle.

Our aim was to compare the efficacies of two meiotic inhibitors, dibutyryl-cAMP and roscovitine for the meiosis synchronization during in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes vitrified at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. We first compared the efficacy of 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP and 25 μM roscovitine on meiotic arrest during the first 22 h of IVM. Dibutyryl-cAMP could maintain the GV stage in 83.5% of oocytes; however, roscovitine was even more effective (96.6%), whereas only 17.4% of the oocytes remained at the GV stage without these additives. Temporal meiotic arrest for 22 h by roscovitine did not reduce the percentage of oocytes reaching the Metaphase II stage during subsequent IVM. However, after parthenogenetic stimulation or in vitro fertilization, subsequent embryo development to the blastocyst stage was compromised after roscovitine treatment, whereas dibutyryl-cAMP improved the percentage of blastocyst development. In conclusion, dibutyryl-cAMP could derogate but not completely prevent premature meiosis in vitrified oocytes, whereas roscovitine could more efficiently prevent it. However, for embryo production, the use of roscovitine was disadvantageous, whereas the use of dibutyryl-cAMP was beneficial. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dbcAMP; embryonic development; porcine oocyte; roscovitine; vitrification","roscovitine; animal; embryo development; in vitro fertilization; meiosis; oocyte; physiology; pig; veterinary medicine; vitrification; Animals; Embryonic Development; Fertilization in Vitro; Meiosis; Oocytes; Roscovitine; Swine; Vitrification","","roscovitine, 186692-46-6; Roscovitine","We thank Ms. Mitsuru Nagai, for technical assistance.

Clogging problems limit the sustainable operation of SATs (i.e., the decrease of infiltration rate), and Physical clogging has been widely studied. However, the effect of biological clogging on the operation of SATs is still unclear. Thus, this study focuses on the effects of biological clogging in an SAT system and demonstrates that the clogging process in an SAT column. In this study, the infiltration rate in the A2O ​+ ​NaN<inf>3</inf> water column decreased slightly, to 6–7 ​cm/h with an average rate of 0.01 ​cm/h per month after 240 ​d, compared with an average rate of 0.3 ​cm/h per month in the columns fed by filtered A2O water. The fastest reduction in infiltration rate, caused by biological clogging, occurred in the first 60 ​d and corresponded to the highest reduction in hydraulic conductivity of 0–2.5 ​cm layer. For alleviating clogging, this study illustrated that removing suspended solids from A2O water by filtration helped reduce approximately 25% of polysaccharides and heterotrophic bacteria. In comparison, pre-ozonation of A2O water helped to reduce approximately 70% of the biomass in the surface layer of the A2O ​+ ​O<inf>3</inf> column. Thus, ozonation of wastewater effluent helps control biological clogging in SAT. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological clogging; Biomass; Ozonation; Soil aquifer treatment; Wastewater reclamation","Aquifers; Effluents; Infiltration; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Soils; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water filtration; % reductions; Average rate; Biological clogging; Biological pre-treatment; Infiltration rate; Management IS; Soil aquifer treatments; Sustainable operations; Sustainable water management; Water security; Ozonization","","","We greatly appreciate the support from the CREST Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2019B1515120052 ) from Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province, China , and we thank the Kyoto City Waterworks Bureau for providing the feed water and technical support for this project.","Ruiz-Rosa, Inés, Development and application of a cost management model for wastewater treatment and reuse processes, Journal of Cleaner Production, 113, pp. 299-310, (2016); Vergine, Pompilio, Closing the water cycle in the agro-industrial sector by reusing treated wastewater for irrigation, Journal of Cleaner Production, 164, pp. 587-596, (2017); Jeong, Hoon Young, A review on clogging mechanisms and managements in aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) applications, Geosciences Journal, 22, 4, pp. 667-679, (2018); He, Kai, Effect of operating conditions in soil aquifer treatment on the removals of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, Science of the Total Environment, 565, pp. 672-681, (2016); Yonetani, Takashi, Fate of selected pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in soil aquifer treatment, Journal of Water Reuse and Desalination, 7, 2, pp. 142-151, (2017); Ye, Zhilong, Occurrence of veterinary antibiotics in struvite recovery from swine wastewater by using a fluidized bed, Frontiers of Environmental Science and Engineering, 12, 3, (2018); Riggio, Vincenzo A., Constructed wetlands for the reuse of industrial wastewater: A case-study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 171, pp. 723-732, (2018); Journal of Water Resource and Protection, (2014); Shen, Ju, Biophysiological and factorial analyses in the treatment of rural domestic wastewater using multi-soil-layering systems, Journal of Environmental Management, 226, pp. 83-94, (2018); Zhang, Peng, An integrated gravity-driven ecological bed for wastewater treatment in subtropical regions: Process design, performance analysis, and greenhouse gas emissions assessment, Journal of Cleaner Production, 212, pp. 1143-1153, (2019)","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","26664453","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127771288"

This study was designed to investigate the brain activity of a senior driver in response to simulated unexpected vehicle motion, compared with a relaxed state and normal driving. Methods: To accomplish this, we created a driving simulator paradigm wherein participants were involved in one of the following three scenarios: sitting down and relaxing, normal driving around the city with traffic signals and other vehicles, and the exiting of a parking area. In the scenario where the driver was to exit the parking area, the gear was switched automatically by the CarMaker software without the driver being notified, leading to an unexpected condition. The driver’s internal states were classified by artificial intelligence, based on information obtained through four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Significant differences were observed between the hemodynamic responses obtained in the three conditions. Ultimately, this method can be used to update advanced driver assistance systems, with a view to preventing future traffic accidents, by activating in-vehicle safety functions based on the driver’s condition. Conclusions: A driver’s internal states in a panic situation while driving can be detected using near-infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ADAS; machine learning; NIRS; Panic; unexpected conditions","artificial intelligence; car driving; human; motion; near infrared spectroscopy; prevention and control; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Artificial Intelligence; Automobile Driving; Humans; Motion; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","","","This study was partially supported by DENSO Corporation and by the Center of Innovation Program (Nagoya University COI: Mobility Innovation Center) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency.","Aghajani, Haleh, Measuring mental workload with EEG+fNIRS, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 11, (2017); undefined, (2010); Dong, Yanchao, Driver inattention monitoring system for intelligent vehicles: A review, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 12, 2, pp. 596-614, (2011); Engström, Johan A., Effects of visual and cognitive load in real and simulated motorway driving, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 8, 2 SPEC.

Moreover, the genetic mechanisms involved remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori infection, antibiotic resistance, and genetic mechanisms in Myanmar. One hundred fifty patients from two cities, Mawlamyine (n = 99) and Yangon (n = 51), were recruited. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 43.3% (65/150). The successfully cultured H. pylori isolates (n = 65) were tested for antibiotic susceptibility to metronidazole, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline by Etest, and the resistance rates were 80%, 33.8%, 7.7%, 4.6%, and 0%, respectively. In the multidrug resistance pattern, the metronidazole–levofloxacin resistance was highest for double-drug resistance (16/19; 84.2%), and all triple-drug resistance (3/3) was clarithromycin–metronidazole–levofloxacin resistance. Twenty-three strains were subjected to next-generation sequencing to study their genetic mechanisms. Interestingly, none of the strains resistant to clarithromycin had well-known mutations in 23S rRNA (e.g., A2142G, A2142C, and A2143G). New type mutation genotypes such as pbp1-A (e.g., V45I, S/R414R), 23S rRNA (e.g., T248C), gyrA (e.g., D210N, K230Q), gyrB (e.g., A584V, N679H), rdxA (e.g., V175I, S91P), and frxA (e.g., L33M) were also detected. In conclusion, the prevalence of H. pylori infection and its antibiotic resistance to metronidazole was high in Myanmar. The H. pylori eradication regimen with classical triple therapy, including amoxicillin and clarithromycin, can be used as the first-line therapy in Myanmar. In addition, next-generation sequencing is a powerful high-throughput method for identifying mutations within antibiotic resistance genes and monitoring the spread of H. pylori antibiotic-resistant strains. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amoxicillin; Antibiotic resistance; Clarithromycin; Helicobacter pylori; Infectious disease; Levofloxacin; Mutations; Next-generation sequencing","","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (DK62813) (YY) and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan (221S0002, 16H06279, 18KK0266, 19H03473) (YY), 18K16182 (TM1 ), and 17K09353(JA).

Also, particle rearrangement and breakage depend on water content (w) (i.e., water states of aggregates) under the compaction process.

Since cassava is propagated through vegetative cuttings, a rapid virus diagnostic method is crucial for generating virus-free planting materials. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay using six primers was developed and validated for the rapid detection of SLCMV in cassava leaves. This SLCMV assay had a detection sensitivity that was up to 10,000 times higher than that of the conventional polymerase chain reaction assay and can detect the virus from symptomless stem cutting, which is a potential long-distance spreader of the virus. Furthermore, a practical LAMP protocol using stable dried reagents from a commercial kit was established so that the assay could be performed in the field by incubating the reactions in water at 60–65 °C instead of using a thermal cycler. The primer sequences and the LAMP protocol described here should be useful for the rapid and sensitive on-site detection of SLCMV. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dried reagent; LAMP; On-site detection; SLCMV","dried reagent; reagent; unclassified drug; dyes, reagents, indicators, markers and buffers; agar gel electrophoresis; amplicon; Article; Begomovirus; cassava; controlled study; DNA extraction; intermethod comparison; loop mediated isothermal amplification; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant stem; plant tissue; polymerase chain reaction; recombinant plasmid; Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus; stem cutting; genetics; Manihot; molecular diagnosis; nucleic acid amplification techniques; plant disease; Indicators and Reagents; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Plant Diseases","","Indicators and Reagents","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (grant number: JPMJSA1508 ), Japan Science and Technology Agency , and Japan International Cooperation Agency .","Brown, Judith K., Revision of Begomovirus taxonomy based on pairwise sequence comparisons, Archives of Virology, 160, 6, pp. 1593-1619, (2015); Czosnek, Henryk H., The incredible journey of Begomoviruses in their whitefly vector, Viruses, 9, 10, (2017); De Jonghe, Kris D., Fast and sensitive on-site isothermal assay (LAMP) for diagnosis and detection of three fruit tree phytoplasmas, European Journal of Plant Pathology, 147, 4, pp. 749-759, (2017); Dutt, Nitin, Identification of a second begomovirus, Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus, causing cassava mosaic disease in India, Archives of Virology, 150, 10, pp. 2101-2108, (2005); FAO Database, (2025); Fukuta, Shiro, Detection of tomato yellow leaf curl virus by loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction, Journal of Virological Methods, 112, 1-2, pp. 35-40, (2003); Graciano-Ribeiro, Dalva, A comparative anatomical study in cassava diploid and tetraploid hybrids, Plant Systematics and Evolution, 298, 9, pp. 1711-1721, (2012); Kil, Eui-Joon, Differential identification of three species of Curtovirus using oop-mediated isothermal amplification, Acta Virologica, 58, 2, pp. 160-166, (2014); Marx, Sanette, Cassava as Feedstock for Ethanol Production: A Global Perspective, pp. 101-113, (2018); Minato, Nami, Surveillance for sri lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV) in Cambodia and Vietnam one year after its initial detection in a single plantation in 2015, PLOS ONE, 14, 2, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18790984; 01660934","","JVMED","34656701","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117932692"

In the first 7 months from the occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam has documented comparatively few cases of COVID-19. Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of these cases may contribute to development of global countermeasures. Methods: We assessed the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 from 23 January to 31 July 2020 in Vietnam. Data were collected from reports of the World Health Organization, the Vietnam Ministry of Health, and related websites. Temporal distribution was assessed via the transmission classification (local or quarantined cases). Geographical distribution was assessed via the number of cases in each province along with their timelines. The most likely disease clusters with elevated incidence were assessed via calculation of the relative risk (RR). Results: Among 544 observed cases of COVID-19, the median age was 35 years, 54.8% were men, and 50.9% were diagnosed during quarantine. During the observation period, there were four phases: Phase 1, COVID-19 cases occurred sporadically in January and February 2020; Phase 2, an epidemic wave occurred from the 1st week of March to the middle of April (Wave 1); Phase 3, only quarantining cases were involved; and Phase 4, a second epidemic wave began on July 25th, 2020 (Wave 2). A spatial cluster in Phase 1 was detected in Vinh Phuc Province (RR, 38.052). In Phase 2, primary spatial clusters were identified in the areas of Hanoi and Ha Nam Province (RR, 6.357). In Phase 4, a spatial cluster was detected in Da Nang, a popular coastal tourist destination (RR, 70.401). Conclusions: Spatial disease clustering of COVID-19 in Vietnam was associated with large cities, tourist destinations, people’s mobility, and the occurrence of nosocomial infections. Past experiences with outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases led to quick implementation of governmental countermeasures against COVID-19 and a general acceptance of these measures by the population. The behaviors of the population and the government, as well as the country’s age distribution, may have contributed to the low incidence and small number of severe COVID-19 cases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19; Disease clustering; Emerging infectious disease; Nosocomial infection; Spatiotemporal analysis","adult; age distribution; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; epidemic; female; geographic distribution; government regulation; health care planning; hospital infection; human; incidence; length of stay; major clinical study; male; occupation; population distribution; quarantine; risk factor; sex difference; spatiotemporal analysis; Viet Nam; epidemiology; pandemic; Adult; COVID-19; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Vietnam","","","This study was supported by Toyota Foundation Initiative program, The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), a Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI, Promotion of Joint International Research B, #20KK0218), and a grant from the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Mirai Program (#20345310).

The students were asked to choose a most significant moral problem of AI applications in the future from a list of ten ethical issues and to write an essay about it. The results show that most of the students (n = 269, 58%) considered unemployment to be the major ethical issue related to AI. The second largest group of students (n = 54, 12%) was concerned with ethical issues related to emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and emotion and robots’ rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students referred to the risk of social control by AI (6%), AI discrimination (6%), increasing inequality (5%), loss of privacy (4%), AI mistakes (3%), malicious AI (3%), and AI security breaches (3%). Calculation of the z score for two population proportions shows that Japanese students were much less concerned about AI control of society (− 3.1276, p < 0.01) than non-Japanese students, but more concerned about discrimination (2.2757, p < 0.05). Female students were less concerned about unemployment (− 2.6108, p < 0.01) than males, but more concerned about discrimination (2.4333, p < 0.05). The study concludes that the moral awareness of college students regarding AI technologies is quite limited and recommends including the ethics of AI in the curriculum. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Emotional AI (EAI); Ethics of technology; Japan; Medical education; Moral awareness","","","","This study received support from “Emotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life” funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019).","Agrawal, Ajay K., Economic policy for artificial intelligence, Innovation Policy and the Economy, 19, 1, pp. 139-159, (2019); Social Robotics Icsr 2016, (2016); Towards A Code of Ethics for Artificial Intelligence, (2017); World Economic Forum, (2016); Bartneck, Christoph, Privacy Issues of AI, SpringerBriefs in Ethics, pp. 61-70, (2021); Curran, Dean, Data-driven governance, smart urbanism and risk-class inequalities: Security and social credit in China, Urban Studies, 58, 3, pp. 487-506, (2021); Emotional Intelligence in Education, (2018); Floridi, Luciano, AI4People—An Ethical Framework for a Good AI Society: Opportunities, Risks, Principles, and Recommendations, Minds and Machines, 28, 4, pp. 689-707, (2018); Ghotbi, Nader, Attitude of college students towards ethical issues of artificial intelligence in an international university in Japan, AI and Society, 37, 1, pp. 283-290, (2022); Global AI Ethics A Review of the Social Impacts and Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","17938759; 17939453","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114170222"

Currently, timely fungicide application is the only means to control ASR in the field. We investigated cellulose nanofiber (CNF) application on ASR disease management. CNF-treated leaves showed reduced lesion number after P. pachyrhizi inoculation compared to control leaves, indicating that covering soybean leaves with CNF confers P. pachyrhizi resistance. We also demonstrated that formation of P. pachyrhizi appressoria, and also gene expression related to these formations, such as chitin synthases (CHSs), were significantly suppressed in CNF-treated soybean leaves compared to control leaves. Moreover, contact angle measurement revealed that CNF converts soybean leaf surface properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. These results suggest that CNF can change soybean leaf surface hydrophobicity, conferring resistance against P. pachyrhizi, based on the reduced expression of CHSs, as well as reduced formation of pre-infection structures.

Basic information on seven CDW landfills under operation or closed/abandoned was collected, and the waste composition and the grain size distributions of dumped CDW at two landfills were investigated. Results showed that only one landfill site is currently under operation in Hanoi. Sanitary conditions of investigated landfills were relatively good without dumping of hazardous waste. Illegal dumping of domestic waste from residents, however, could be observed more or less at all sites due to an unclear boundary between dumping and surrounding areas. To improve current management of CDW landfills, a suitable recording system of accepted/dumped CDW and technical support for site managers are required as well as the implementation plan for developing and renovating landfills. Based on the results of the waste composition survey, the major components of dumped CDW were “Concrete”, “Clay bricks”, and “Soil-like”, and the sum of these materials reached >80% of the total. Grain size distributions of “Concrete” ranged from 10–600 mm and of “Clay bricks” ranged from 10–300 mm. Technical recommendations to examine a potential availability of dumped “Concrete” and “Clay bricks” as a base material in road construction are summarized from the viewpoints of segregation from “Soil-like” and impurities, grading of “Concrete” and “Clay bricks”, mechanical properties and environmental safety, and economic feasibility. The findings in this study raise challenges and perspectives to establish sound CDW management and to promote sustainable development of CDW recycling in Vietnam. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CDW landfills; Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Grain size distribution; Hanoi; Vietnam; Waste composition","abandoned land; domestic waste; grain size; landfill; recycling; road construction; size distribution; sustainable development; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This research was supported by JST–JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Pierrehumbert, Raymound T., There is no Plan B for dealing with the climate crisis, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 75, 5, pp. 215-221, (2019); Resource Efficiency; Villoria-Sáez, Paola, Estimation of construction and demolition waste, pp. 13-30, (2020); Huang, Beijia, Construction and demolition waste management in China through the 3R principle, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 129, pp. 36-44, (2018); National Waste Report 2018, (2018); Waste Statistics European Commission, (2018); Value Added by Economic Activity National Account Section, (2019); Designing with Vision A Technical Manual for Materials Choices in Sustainable Construction, (2000); Agamuthu, Pariatamby, Challenges in sustainable management of construction and demolition waste, Waste Management and Research, 26, 6, pp. 491-492, (2008); Hoang, Ngoc Han, A review of construction and demolition waste management in Southeast Asia, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 22, 2, pp. 315-325, (2020)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114898279"

However, TIs are usually deposited by molecular beam epitaxy on single crystalline III-V semiconductor or sapphire substrates, which are not suitable for realistic applications. Here, we studied SOT characteristics in sputtered BiSb topological insulator - Pt/Co/Pt - MgO heterostructures deposited on oxidized Si substrates, where Pt/Co/Pt trilayers have a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field of 4.5 kOe. We show that the BiSb layer has a large effective spin Hall angle of θ SH eff = 2.4 and a high electrical conductivity of σ = 1.0 × 105 ω-1 m-1. The magnetization can be switched by a small current density of 2.3 × 106 A cm-2 at a pulse width of 100 μs, which is 1 or 2 orders of magnitudes smaller than those in heavy metals. Our work demonstrates the high efficiency and robustness of BiSb as a spin current source in realistic SOT-MRAM. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Antimony compounds; Bismuth compounds; Cobalt; Electric insulators; Heavy metals; III-V semiconductors; Magnesia; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Molecular beam epitaxy; MRAM devices; Oxide minerals; Platinum compounds; Random access storage; Sapphire; Silicon; Spin orbit coupling; Topological insulators; High electrical conductivity; High-efficiency; Large effective; Orders of magnitude; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Realistic applications; Sapphire substrates; Single-crystalline; Substrates","","","This work was supported by the CREST program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (No. JPMJCR18T5).

Gastric biopsies were performed (353 patients), and the prevalence of H. pylori infection was 1.7% (culture) and 2.0% (histology). IgG serology testing showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.922 (cut-off, 2.95 U/mL; specificity, 91.56%; sensitivity, 88.89%). Histological evaluation showed mild atrophy (34.3%), moderate atrophy (1.7%), metaplasia (1.7%), chronic gastritis (6.2%), and normal tissue (56%). The PGI/PGII ratio was significantly higher in H. pylori-negative patients (p < 0.01). PGII and PGI/PGII levels were lower in patients with metaplasia than in those with normal mucosa (p = 0.049 and p < 0.001, respectively). The PGI/PGII ratio best discriminated metaplasia and moderate atrophy (AUC 0.88 and 0.76, respectively). PGI and PGII alone showed poor discriminative ability, especially in mild atrophy (0.55 and 0.53, respectively) and chronic gastritis (0.55 and 0.53, respectively). The best cut-off to discriminate metaplasia was 3.25 U/mL (95.19% specificity, 83.33% sensitivity). Anti-H. pylori IgG and PG assessment (ABC method) was performed (group B, 2.0%; group A, 92.1%).

This study assesses potential CDW recycling in Hanoi by estimating the prospective supply of and demand for CDW recycling plants and evaluating their likely costs and benefits. Supply of concrete waste was calculated based on the weight-per-construction-area method whilst demand for recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) was determined by estimating the amount of aggregates for road construction in Hanoi from 2013 to 2017. Two potential models of CDW recycling plants were considered: a stationary plant and a mobile plant, with capacities of 1,000 and 360 tons/day, respectively. Our findings reveal that demand for RCA exceeds waste concrete supply, suggesting a promising market for RCA. Positive Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return values of the stationary plant indicate its feasibility as an investment option. Meanwhile, the introduction of mobile recycling plants might require governmental intervention to internalize recycling positive externalities. Supporting policies might include a combination of a virgin material tax, green public procurement, and quality standard development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cost benefit analysis; Mobile plant; Recycled concrete aggregates; Stationary plant; Waste recycling","Concrete aggregates; Cost benefit analysis; Earnings; Economic analysis; Investments; Recycling; Waste management; Construction and demolition waste; Cost-benefits analysis; Economics evaluations; Financial evaluation; Mobile plants; Recycled concrete aggregates; Recycling plant; Stationary plant; Viet Nam; Wastes recycling; Demolition; aggregate; concrete; cost-benefit analysis; demolition; economic analysis; feasibility study; finance; recycling; waste management; Article; capital cost; construction and demolition waste; controlled study; cost; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; economic evaluation; financial management; internal rate of return; landfill; operating cost; positive net present value; price; recycled concrete aggregate; building industry; building material; industrial waste; prospective study; Hanoi; Construction Industry; Construction Materials; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Industrial Waste; Prospective Studies; Vietnam; Waste Management","","Industrial Waste","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) - Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (No. JPMJSA1701).

Broad-scale seagrass distribution has not been updated in the global seagrass database by UNEP-WCMC since 2000, although studies on seagrasses have been undertaken intensively in each region. Here we analyze the recent distribution of tropical seagrass beds, their temporal changes, causes of decline and conservation status in Southeast Asia (plus southern mainland China, Taiwan and Ryukyu Island of Japan) using data collected after 2000. Based on the 195 literature published since 2000, we identified 1,259 point data and 1,461 polygon data showing the distribution of seagrass beds. A large discrepancy was found in the seagrass bed distribution between our updated data and the UNEP-WCMC database, mostly due to inaccurate and low resolution location information in the latter. Temporal changes in seagrass bed area analyzed for 68 sites in nine countries/regions demonstrated that more than 60% of seagrass beds declined at an average rate of 10.9% year–1, whereas 20% of beds increased at an average rate of 8.1% year–1, leading to an overall average decline of 4.7% year–1. Various types of human-induced threats were reported as causes for the decline, including coastal development, fisheries/aquaculture, and natural factors such as typhoons and tsunamis. The percentage of seagrass beds covered with existing marine protected areas (MPAs) varied greatly among countries/regions, from less than 1% in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore to 100% in southern Japan. However, the degree of conservation regulation was not sufficient even in regions with higher MPA coverage. The percentage of seagrass beds within EBSAs (Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area determined by the Convention of Biological Diversity) was higher than that within MPAs because EBSAs cover a greater area than MPAs. Therefore, designating EBSAs as legally effective MPAs can greatly improve the conservation status of seagrass beds in Southeast Asia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","broad-scale distribution; coastal ecosystem; GIS mapping; marine protected area; temporal trend","","","","Funding text 1: This manuscript is a contribution to the Asia-Pacific Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (AP-MBON) of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON).

Interestingly, the samples sintered at 1273 K and 1673 K had the same Seebeck coefficient, despite the 1273 K sample having significantly lower conductivity, which are discussed via phase composition and interstitial oxygen induced during the CuCrO<inf>2</inf> phase formation and its related defect (V<inf>Cu</inf>, V<inf>Cr</inf>, …). Besides, high conductivity of the 1673 K sample originated from the low percentage of CuO phase and the appearance of Cu<inf>2</inf>O phase. Since the 1273 K and 1673 K sintered samples have almost the same percentage of delafossite and spinel phases so the 1673 K sample still remain its high Seebeck coefficient.

Here, we use empirical data from 732 locations in 43 countries to estimate the mortality burdens associated with the additional heat exposure that has resulted from recent human-induced warming, during the period 1991–2018. Across all study countries, we find that 37.0% (range 20.5–76.3%) of warm-season heat-related deaths can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and that increased mortality is evident on every continent. Burdens varied geographically but were of the order of dozens to hundreds of deaths per year in many locations. Our findings support the urgent need for more ambitious mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the public health impacts of climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","climate change; health impact; human activity; mortality; public health","","","We thank the participants of the ISIMIP Health workshop in Barcelona in November 2018 where this work was discussed for the first time.

Although a large body of research has addressed the effects of forest harvesting on stream temperature, less is known about the responses of stream temperature to the practice of strip‐thinning, which produces more coherent patches of shade and sunlight areas. In this study, we examined stream temperature response to 50% strip‐thinning in a 17 ha headwater catchment. The thinning lines extended through the riparian zone. Paired‐catchment analysis was applied to estimate changes in daily maximum, mean, and minimum stream temperatures for the first year following treatment. Significant effects on daily maximum stream temperature were found for April to August, ranging from 0.6 °C to 3.9 °C, similar to the magnitude of effect found in previous studies involving 50% random thinning. We conducted further analysis to identify the thermal response variability in relation to hydrometeorological drivers. Multiple regression analysis revealed that treatment effects for maximum daily stream temperature were positively related to solar radiation and negatively related to discharge. Frequent precipitation during the summer monsoon season produced moderate increases in discharge (from 1 to 5 mm day−1), mitigating stream temperature increases associated with solar radiation. Catchment hydrologic response to rain events can play an important role in controlling stream thermal response to forest management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forest harvesting; Headwater stream; Paired‐catchment analysis; Stream temperature; Strip‐thinning","Catchments; Ecosystems; Radiation effects; Runoff; Solar radiation; Biological process; Forest harvesting; Forest management practices; Headwater catchment; Hydrologic response; Multiple regression analysis; Stream temperatures; Treatment effects; Forestry; biological processes; catchment; forest management; freshwater ecosystem; headwater; hydrological response; hydrometeorology; management practice; seasonal variation; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; streamwater","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Japan Science and Technology (JST), Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) projects entitled “Field and modeling studies on the effect of forest devastation on flooding and environmental issues” and “Development of Innovative Technologies for Increasing in Watershed Runoff and Improving River Environment by Management Practice of Devastated Forest Plantation”.

However, data on novel bulk polymers is lacking, which is detrimental to conveying their superiority for applications. Hence, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations could lead to understanding some important properties with great accuracy. In this work, MD simulations of chitosan/sulfonated poly (vinyl) alcohol (CS/SPVA) composite membranes produced in our previous experimental work are performed. First, the miscibility of the CS/SPVA composite is confirmed by simulating the Flory-Huggins interaction χ, which satisfies the condition χ < χ<inf>critical</inf>. In terms of thermal stability, the glass transition temperature T<inf>g</inf> of the CS/SPVA composite is simulated at a value of 430 K (with only 3.18% deviation from the literature data). This suggests that the composite membrane satisfied the fuel cell working condition of 353 K. The proton conductivity was quantified by the ability of hydronium ions to diffuse into the polymer matrix. The simulated data demonstrated a higher proton conductivity in the CS/SPVA15 composite membrane than in the single SPVA membrane, with a computed value of 11.15 mS/cm. In addition, the RDFs agree with the Grotthuss-type proton transfer mechanism proposed in the CS/SPVA15 polymer model. In addition, better mechanical properties are reported with CS/SPVA15 composite membranes, with an approximately 110% improvement in the average Young's modulus. This suggests that the composite membrane has a much more compact and rigid structure than the SPVA membrane. This is beneficial for achieving an electrolyte polymer with better dimensional stability, which could prevent potential membrane failure during fuel cell operation. It can be concluded that the CS/SPVA composite displays superior thermal and mechanical stability, as well as proton conductivity, compared to the SPVA membrane. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chitosan/sulfonated poly(vinyl alcohol); Mechanical properties; Proton transport","Chitosan; Composite membranes; Composite structures; Elastic moduli; Glass transition; Mechanical stability; Membranes; Molecular dynamics; Polymer matrix composites; Polyvinyl alcohols; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Rigid structures; Electrolyte membrane; Fuel cell operation; Glass transition temperature Tg; Molecular dynamics simulations; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Proton transport properties; Proton-transfer mechanism; Thermal and mechanical stabilities; Solid electrolytes","","","This work is supported in part by the research grant from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia , Grant Number DIP-2018-012 and PP-SELFUEL-2020 , and the Japan Science and Technology Agency , ACT-I, Grant Number JPMJPR17UU .","Procedia Technol, (2016); Wong, Chunyik, Comparative Study on Water Uptake and Ionic Transport Properties of Pre- and Post Sulfonated Chitosan/PVA polymer Exchange Membrane, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 458, 1, (2018); Es Mater Manuf, (2020); Sharma, Parul, Evaluating the potential of chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) membranes as alternative carrier material for proliferation of Vero cells, E-Polymers, 15, 4, pp. 237-243, (2015); Ghosh, Saikat, Bio-evaluation of doxorubicin (DOX)-incorporated hydroxyapatite (HAp)-chitosan (CS) nanocomposite triggered on osteosarcoma cells, Advanced Composites and Hybrid Materials, 3, 3, pp. 303-314, (2020); Cheung, Randy Chi Fai, Chitosan: An update on potential biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, Marine Drugs, 13, 8, pp. 5156-5186, (2015); Kordjazi, Sheyda, Super-hydrophilic/oleophobic chitosan/acrylamide hydrogel: an efficient water/oil separation filter, Advanced Composites and Hybrid Materials, 3, 2, pp. 167-176, (2020); Hu, Fuqiang, Preparation and properties of chitosan/acidified attapulgite composite proton exchange membranes for fuel cell applications, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 137, 36, (2020); Wong, Chunyik, Development of Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)-Based Polymers as Proton Exchange Membranes and Challenges in Fuel Cell Application: A Review, Polymer Reviews, 60, 1, pp. 171-202, (2020); Mokhtar, Marliyana, A short review on alkaline solid polymer electrolyte based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as polymer electrolyte for electrochemical devices applications, International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11, 19, pp. 10009-10015, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00323861","","POLMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100018155"

Odonata are commonly used as a biodiversity indicator in these low-input farms. However, the effect of agrochemical-free rice farming on odonate diversity has rarely been assessed over the entire emergence period of these insects. We investigated whether different farming practices, such as conventional or natural (agrochemical-and fertilizer-free) cultivation, and associated water management strategies affect the emergence rates of Odonata in paddy field landscapes in central Japan. Weekly exuviae sampling in 2017 and 2019 suggested that odonate assemblages differed between conventional and natural paddy fields, with a higher number of taxa emerging from natural paddy fields. Contrary to expectations, conventional paddy fields had equivalent or higher emergence rates of all Odonata and two numerically dominant Sympetrum species. Peak emergence periods for numerically dominant taxa differed between the farming types, with the emergence of three Sympetrum species peaking in late June in conventional paddy fields and that of S. frequens peaking in early to mid-July in natural paddy fields. Our findings suggest that both conventional and natural paddy fields are important habitats for Odonata in Japan. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","damselfly; dragonfly; environmentally friendly farming; exuviae; organic farming; rice field; Sympetrum; wildlife-friendly farming","","","","Funding text 1: We thank Shuhei Kudo, Masfiro Lailati, and Yichen Shang for assisting with the field work, Kosuke Nakanishi for providing advice on R, Takashi Aoki for providing literature and discussion on Odonata life histories, and to the local farmers for granting us their permission to perform research in their paddy fields.

Therefore, in this study, a combined upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor and downflow hanging sponge (DHS) biosystem has been applied for the treatment of synthetic water-soluble copolymer wastewater. Copolymer consisted of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol with a total molecular weight of 8,500, commonly preferred in the automobile parts processing factory, were included in influent. Overall, the whole UASB–DHS system achieved a favorable chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 86% ± 7%. In more detail, with an organic loading rate of 2.12 kg-COD ⋅ m−3⋅ day −1, the UASB reactor enhanced the biodegradability of wastewater, and reached COD removal efficiency of 61% ± 16%. Meanwhile, gel permeation chromatography analysis indicated that the molecular weight of the wastewater was primarily reduced in the DHS reactor. In addition, massive 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that polyethylene-glycol-degrading bacteria Pelobacter sp. was predominant in the UASB granular sludge. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic digestion; UASB; Water-soluble copolymer degradation","Aliphatic compounds; Biodegradability; Biodegradation; Efficiency; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Gel permeation chromatography; Molecular weight; Polyols; RNA; Soaps (detergents); Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Anaerobic biological treatments; Chemical oxygen demand removals; COD removal efficiency; Down-flow hanging sponges; Poly vinyl pyrrolidone; Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors; Water soluble copolymers; Chemical oxygen demand","","","This research is supported by Adaptable and Seamless Technology transfer Program through Target-driven R&D (A-STEP) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (Project Number: VP30118066603 ).","Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (2025); Araki, Nobuo, Behaviors of nitrifiers in a novel biofilm reactor employing hanging sponge-cubes as attachment site, Water Science and Technology, 39, 7, pp. 23-31, (1999); Bernhard, Marco, Aerobic biodegradation of polyethylene glycols of different molecular weights in wastewater and seawater, Water Research, 42, 19, pp. 4791-4801, (2008); Chen, Shuangya, Syntrophobacter sulfatireducens sp. nov., a novel syntrophic, propionate-oxidizing bacterium isolated from UASB reactors, International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, 55, 3, pp. 1319-1324, (2005); Dwyer, Daryl F., Metabolism of polyethylene glycol by two anaerobic bacteria, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and a Bacteroides sp., Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 52, 4, pp. 852-856, (1986); El-Kamah, Hala M., Performance of down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor coupled with up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for treatment of onion dehydration wastewater, Bioresource Technology, 102, 14, pp. 7029-7035, (2011); Eubeler, Jan P., Environmental biodegradation of synthetic polymers II.

However, challenges to institutionalise wastewater surveillance systems are still abundant and unfolding at a rapid rate given that the international understanding regarding the scientific knowledge and socio-political impacts of COVID-19 are in the developing stages. To better understand the existing challenges and bottlenecks, a comparative study between Japan, Viet Nam, and Indonesia was carried out in the present study.

This long-standing collaboration adopts agricultural technologies developed in Japan and promotes agricultural innovation through cutting-edge technologies such as remote sensing for Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will provide novel solutions to the agriculture and food sectors in the tropics. Nowadays, it is presumed that this approach to data-driven agriculture realization will help establish a sustainable agroecosystem with increased agricultural productivity and sustainability by adapting or mitigating the effects of climate change and efficient use of natural resources and establishing a sustainable food value chain.

For this, we evaluated the effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and insulin–transferrin–selenium (ITS) supplementation either alone or in combination during oocyte in vitro maturation on the quality of porcine blastocysts and the embryonic development after injection of mouse iPS cells. Our results demonstrate that, prior to injection of mouse iPS cells, CGA or ITS supplementation either alone or in combination had no effects on the rates of oocyte maturation, oocyte DNA fragmentation, fertilization, and blastocyst formation. However, the combination of CGA and ITS significantly increased the total cell number in blastocysts compared with the control group (P < 0.05). When mouse iPS cells were injected into porcine blastocysts, CGA supplementation either alone or in combination with ITS had a beneficial effect on the development of interspecies chimera blastocysts. In conclusion, our results indicate that supplementation of maturation medium with a combination of CGA and ITS enhances the ability of porcine oocytes to develop interspecies chimera blastocysts following iPS cell injection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chlorogenic acid; insulin–transferrin–selenium; interspecies chimera; mouse iPS cells; porcine blastocyst","antioxidant; chlorogenic acid; insulin; mercaptoethanol; selenium; transferrin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; blastocyst; cell count; chimera; clinical article; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA fragmentation; embryo development; female; in vitro fertilization; in vitro oocyte maturation; in vitro study; induced pluripotent stem cell; interspecific competition; male; meiosis; nonhuman; oocyte; ovary follicle; pig; spermatozoon; supplementation","","chlorogenic acid, 327-97-9; insulin, 9004-10-8; mercaptoethanol, 60-24-2; selenium, 7782-49-2; transferrin, 82030-93-1","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Nippon Food Packer, K.

The aim of this study was to find out the correlation between the number of penetrated sperm and the occurrence of failure of MPN formation in porcine oocytes. In vitro matured porcine oocytes were fertilized in vitro with frozen epididymal sperm. Two different frozen sperm lots were tested in this study, which were different in terms of polyspermy rates. The numbers and the status of penetrated sperm in oocytes were evaluated 10 h after insemination. Under high polyspermy condition, the polyspermy rate was 83.5% with an average mean of 3.5 sperms per penetrated oocyte, whereas the percentage of polyspermy was 65.5% with an average mean of 2.4 sperms per penetrated oocyte under moderate polyspermic condition. Correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the number of penetrated sperm and their MPN formation percentage both in the sperm lot of high polyspermy (R = −0.560, p < 0.05) and in the sperm lot of moderate polyspermy (R = −0.405, p < 0.05) which suggests that penetration of excessive spermatozoa disables the oocyte cytoplasm to promote MPN formation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","animal; fertility; fertilization; in vitro fertilization; male; oocyte; pig; spermatozoon; veterinary medicine; Animals; Fertilization; Fertilization in Vitro; Male; Oocytes; Sperm-Ovum Interactions; Spermatozoa; Swine","","","Hiep Thi Nguyen is a recipient of a Monbukagakusho scholarship from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology for foreign PhD students (2016–2020).

The authors have developed a simple method to predict rising groundwater levels in natural slopes at a relatively shallow depth based on parametric studies conducted using the finite element method. An assumption of a semi-infinite homogeneous slope was adopted in the analysis. Addtionally, the authors numerically modelled the vertical infiltration and the lateral seepage flow. Using this method implies that the finite element analysis is not mandatory in the evaluations of practical slopes. Such a simplified approach helps avoid time-consuming tasks in rigorous computations. However, a semi-infinite assumption used in the developed method may provide us with unsuitable solutions, particularly in cases where the slopes include heavily terraced topography with local small cliffs, because theoretically, the first slope failure tends to occur in steep slopes, like the edge of a rice terrace, even though they are very small cliffs. Nevertheless, these local solutions do not affect the conclusions for disaster risk reduction. Moreover, such unsuitable alternatives must be eliminated during analysis. To address this matter, the current study proposes a novel concept of specific lengths. This procedure provides a representative length within the specified length range. The averaged slope gradient is defined by focusing on the secant lines between each topographical grid, while those defined outside the specified range – for example, local cliff angles – are ignored in the slope stability calculation. Consequently, the proposed concept was confirmed to be efficient and can be applied to evaluate the terraced rice fields in Sapa, northern Vietnam. In the past, this area had experienced rainfall-induced slope failures; hence, the proposed method may be able to simulate these occurences.

F. fujikuroi is horizontally transmitted to rice flowers and vertically transmitted to the next generation via seeds. The fungus induces typical symptoms such as abnormal tissue elongation and etiolation. Sanitation of seed farms and seed disinfection are the only effective means to control bakanae disease at present; however, the efficacy of these methods is often insufficient. Therefore, alternative and innovative control methods are necessary. We developed a novel method for applying nonpathogenic fusaria as biocontrol agents by spraying spore suspensions onto rice flowers to reduce the incidence of seed-borne bakanae. We visualized the interaction between Fusarium commune W5, a nonpathogenic fusarium, and Fusarium fujikuroi using transformants expressing two different fluorescent proteins on/in rice plants. W5 inhibited hyphal extension of F. fujikuroi on/in rice flowers and seedlings, possibly by competing with the pathogen, and survived on/in rice seeds for at least 6 months. IMPORTANCE We demonstrated that a spray treatment of rice flowers with the spores of nonpathogenic fusaria mimicked the disease cycle of the seed-borne bakanae pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi and effectively suppressed the disease. Spray treatment of nonpathogenic fusaria reduced the degree of pathogen invasion of rice flowers and vertical transmission of the pathogen to the next plant generation via seeds, thereby controlling the bakanae disease. The most promising isolate, F. commune W5, colonized seeds and seedlings via treated flowers and successfully inhibited pathogen invasion, suggesting that competition with the pathogen was the mode of action. Seed-borne diseases are often controlled by seed treatment with chemical fungicides. Establishing an alternative method is a pressing issue from the perspectives of limiting fungicide resistance and increasing food security. This work provides a potential solution to these issues using a novel application technique to treat rice flowers with biocontrol agents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bakanae disease; Biocontrol; Flower spraying; Fusarium fujikuroi; Nonpathogenic Fusarium commune; Seed-borne","Biocontrol; Disease control; Food supply; Fungi; Fungicides; Pathogens; Bakanae disease; Biocontrol agent; Flower spraying; Fusarium; Fusarium fujikuroi; Nonpathogenic fusarium commune; Plant generation; Seed borne disease; Seed-borne; Seed; biocontrol agent; disinfection; fungal disease; fungicide; fungus; host-pathogen interaction; seed treatment; Fusarium commune; Gibberella fujikuroi; biological pest control; flower; fungus spore; microbiology; Oryza; plant disease; prevention and control; Flowers; Pest Control, Biological; Plant Diseases; Spores, Fungal","","","The authors express their gratitude to T.

However, the origin of the high TC in (Ga,Fe)Sb remains to be elucidated. To address this issue, we use resonant photoemission spectroscopy (RPES) and first-principles calculations to investigate the x dependence of the Fe 3d states in (Ga1-x,Fex)Sb (x=0.05, 0.15, and 0.25) thin films. The observed Fe 2p-3d RPES spectra reveal that the Fe-3d impurity band (IB) crossing the Fermi level becomes broader with increasing x, which is qualitatively consistent with the picture of double-exchange interaction. Comparison between the obtained Fe-3d partial density of states and the first-principles calculations suggests that the Fe-3d IB originates from the minority-spin (↓) e states. The results indicate that enhancement of the double-exchange interaction between e↓ electrons with increasing x is the origin of the high TC in (Ga,Fe)Sb. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Calculations; Curie temperature; Exchange interactions; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Iron; Iron metallography; Magnetic semiconductors; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Double exchange interactions; Ferromagnetic semiconductor; First-principles calculation; High Curie temperature; Impurity bands; Partial density of state; Resonant photoemission spectroscopy; Spintronic device; Iron compounds","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank K.

The development of root systems in response to SMF and the ability of roots to elongate through the hardpan when it becomes relatively soft during re-watering are key rice traits to efficiently extract water at the deep soil during subsequent periods of drought. Thus, this study aimed to identify their chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) from Sasanishiki and Habataki crosses, which have root plasticity exhibited in response to SMF, which enables plants to penetrate the hardpan and develop deep root systems. Root plasticity was evaluated by comparing root traits between each of the 39 CSSLs and their recurrent parent, Sasanishiki, under water-stressed and well-watered (WW control) conditions in hydroponics and soil-filled pots. Among the 39 CSSLs, three (SL34, SL35 and SL39) had similar growth as Sasanishiki under WW, but were able to produce greater shoot dry weight than their recurrent parent under transient soil moisture stress in hydroponics and soil culture. Under SMF, in the rootbox-pinboard and rootbox-hardpan systems, only SL39 showed a significantly greater root system development than Sasanishiki. SL39 also had a more enhanced root aerenchyma formation than Sasanishiki in the shallow layer during drought-rewatered conditions under SMF, possibly facilitating atmospheric O2 diffusion to the root tips. As a consequence, SL39 promoted nodal root elongation through the hardpan during rewatering and subsequent greater deep root system development to access more water from the deep soil during the drought period of SMF, relative to Sasanishiki. The results implied that SL39 can be a good genetic material to study the QTLs associated with plasticity in root hardpan penetration and deep root system development in rice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerenchyma; Artificial hardpan; Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs); Deep root system; Rainfed lowland rice; Root penetration ability","","","","This research was funded by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 18H02188) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).","Adachi, Shunsuke, Characterization of a rice variety with high hydraulic conductance and identification of the chromosome region responsible using chromosome segment substitution lines, Annals of Botany, 106, 5, pp. 803-811, (2010); Adachi, Shunsuke, Identification of Chromosomal Regions Controlling the Leaf Photosynthetic Rate in Rice by Using a Progeny from Japonica and High-Yielding Indica Varieties, Plant Production Science, 14, 2, pp. 118-127, (2011); undefined; Ali, M.

Waste quantification based on CDW layout, image analysis to identify CDW components, and face-to-face interviews with construction and demolition contractors to reveal CDW flows were performed. WGRs of 79.3 kg/m2 and 1,030 kg/m2 were determined in small- and large-scale construction sites, respectively, whilst WGRs at small and large demolition sites were 610 kg/m2 and 318 kg/m2. The composition analysis identified soil, concrete, and brick as the major CDW components, consistent with building structures in Vietnam. The interviews discovered that merely 10% of total CDW flows was from recycled and reused CDW. Reuse and recycling rates were most significant for metal and were lower (in descending order) for brick, concrete, and soil. These findings raise a need for aggressive and integrated strategies to promote more sustainable CDW management in the country, including the development of recycled CDW product standards, policies that facilitate recycling, and more importantly, a sustainable business model for CDW recycling, for which future evaluations of economic feasibility are of great importance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CDW handling; CDW recycling; Image analysis; Waste generation rate; Waste quantification","Brick; Concretes; Construction; Demolition; Recycling; Building construction; Composition analysis; Construction and demolition; Construction and demolition waste; Economic feasibilities; Face-to-face interview; Waste generation rates; Waste quantifications; Charge density waves; construction industry; demolition; feasibility study; industrial waste; pollution policy; quantitative analysis; recycling; standard (reference); waste disposal; waste management; article; construction and demolition waste; image analysis; interview; soil; Viet Nam; building industry; building material; Hanoi; Construction Industry; Construction Materials; Industrial Waste; Vietnam; Waste Management","","Industrial Waste","This research was supported as a project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) – Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (No. JPMJSA1701 ).

Although the ORR activity depends on the surface area arisen from pyrolysis-generated micropores on C−Fe-PANI particles, the micropore generation is hindered by pyrolysis-formed iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) embedded inside C−Fe-PANI particles. Here, we demonstrate the pyrolysis of iron-containing PANIs under suppression of micropore-generation hindrance by blocking the Fe NPs formation. The higher-molecular-weight (MW: 100,000) PANI was dispersed in an FeCl<inf>3</inf> solution before pyrolysis for preventing FeCl<inf>3</inf> penetration inside PANI particles. As a result, as compared to the case of lower-MW (5,000) PANI, the Fe NPs formation was more suppressed inside catalyst particles to give 1.9 (1.8) times micropore volume (specific surface area), leading to a 11 % higher current density in ORR electrocatalytic performance test in acidic media. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","iron; microporous materials; nanoparticles; oxygen reduction reaction; polyaniline","","","","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (ACT‐C).

Moreover, full-size PCa PC slab specimens with and without fly ash content are constructed and subjected to both bending and pushing shear loading tests to investigate the differences in their bending and punching shear resistance. Numerical models are then developed using finite element method to evaluate the experimental results. Analyses elicited good agreement between simulations and experimental data and validated the numerical models. Based on the obtained results, this study clarified the mechanical properties of PCa PC slab using fly ash concrete, and then its practical use in the renewal project of highway was discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bending loading test; fly ash concrete; Highly durable precast prestressed concrete slab; punching shear loading test; renewal project of highway","Bending tests; Calcium compounds; Deterioration; Fly ash; Highway bridges; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Precast concrete; Prestressed concrete; Reinforced concrete; Roads and streets; Silica; Bending loading; Fly ash concretes; Pre-cast; Punching shear; Renewal projects; Concrete slabs","","","This research was promoted by the Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program [Resolution of Early-Aged Deterioration Mechanisms in Concrete Bridges and Development of Total Management System Based on Evaluation for Material and Structure Quality Performance, Kanazawa University] from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

Either 50 newly hatched mealybug nymphs or parasitized third-instar mealybugs were reared on taro or cassava seedlings to examine immature development, fecundity and longevity of adults. Nearly 90% of P. manihoti reared on taro successfully developed to adults and they produced 230 eggs on average in their lifetime, while insects reared on cassava showed 95% survival and 250 eggs of lifetime fecundity. For A. lopezi, immature survival was 86% and they laid 140 eggs on average on taro, while it was 88% and 140 eggs on cassava.

In the present study, to determine the useful parameter for the efficient irrigation system, jatropha plants were grown in pots and root boxes under greenhouse conditions in Okinawa, Japan. At 6 to 9 months after transplanting, we measured the gas exchange rate during ongoing soil water deficits and attempted to identify the threshold of soil matric potential (pF) with changes of both intrinsic water use efficiency (A/gs) as a stomatal-based index and carboxylation efficiency (A/C<inf>i</inf>) as an index of non-stomatal limitation. When irrigation was stopped, A and gs began to decline, with each parameter reaching zero at pF 4.0. However, gs was more sensitive to soil water deficits than A. After re-watering, stomatal openings and carbon uptake recovered to the value observed before water stress treatment. At pF 3.5 and higher values (representing more severe water stress), A/gs intended to increase and A/C<inf>i</inf> sharply decreased. These results suggested that approximately pF 3.5 in the soil was the threshold of non-stomatal limitations to photosynthetic rate and should be useful to the re-watering point for the water-efficient irrigation system in jatropha.

Particularly, high-temperature thermal annealing increased markedly both the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the aligned MWCNT/epoxy composites. The enhancement in the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the composites is mainly attributed to significant improvement of the MWCNT nanostructure by high-temperature thermal annealing. Generally, high-temperature thermal annealing improved the stiffness of the aligned MWCNT sheets and their composites considerably. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon nanotubes; heat treatment; mechanical properties; nanocomposites; surface modification","Annealing; Carbon nanotubes; Elastic moduli; Heat treatment; Image enhancement; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Stiffness; Surface treatment; Tensile strength; Transmission electron microscopy; After high temperature; High temperature; Hot melt; Microstructural morphology; Prepregs; Spectra measurements; Thermal-annealing; Transmission electron; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)","","","We appreciate the financial support from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) through the Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program (ALCA) and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) through the ISAS strategic development fund for space engineering.","Iijima, Sumio, Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon, Nature, 354, 6348, pp. 56-58, (1991); Ruoff, Rodney S., Mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes, Carbon, 33, 7, pp. 925-930, (1995); Treacy, Michael M.J., Exceptionally high Young's modulus observed for individual carbon nanotubes, Nature, 381, 6584, pp. 678-680, (1996); Ebbesen, Thomas Wren, Electrical conductivity of individual carbon nanotubes, Nature, 382, 6586, pp. 54-56, (1996); Baughman, Ray H., Carbon nanotubes - The route toward applications, Science, 297, 5582, pp. 787-792, (2002); Inoue, Yoku, One-step grown aligned bulk carbon nanotubes by chloride mediated chemical vapor deposition, Applied Physics Letters, 92, 21, (2008); Lepró, Xavier, Spinnable carbon nanotube forests grown on thin, flexible metallic substrates, Carbon, 48, 12, pp. 3621-3627, (2010); Patole, Shashikant P., The synthesis of vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes on an aluminum foil laminated on stainless steel, Carbon, 49, 11, pp. 3522-3528, (2011); Jiang, Kaili, Spinning continuous carbon nanotube yarns, Nature, 419, 6909, (2002); Ghemes, Adrian Iulian, Fabrication and mechanical properties of carbon nanotube yarns spun from ultra-long multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays, Carbon, 50, 12, pp. 4579-4587, (2012)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","09276440; 15685543","","CMNTE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073992871"

Powders were made from 42-month cured paste of ordinary Portland cement, fly ash cement, and ground granulated blast furnace slag cement. The suspensions were prepared by mixing the paste powders into various solutions of Ca(OH)<inf>2</inf>, CaCl<inf>2</inf>, NaCl, Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>, MgCl<inf>2</inf>, MgSO<inf>4</inf> and artificial seawater with a solid-to-solution ratio of 0.1 g/L. The measurement of zeta potentials of paste suspensions was carried out. The chloride binding capacities of the pastes exposed to seawater were compared to pastes exposed to NaCl solution. The results indicated that Mg2+ and Ca2+ can reverse the negative surface charge of paste particles in aqueous solution to positive, except Mg2+ dissociated from solely MgSO<inf>4</inf> solution, leading to the higher chloride binding capacities for the pastes exposed to seawater compared to NaCl solution. Furthermore, the important impacts of Van der Waals interaction and hydrotalcite-like phase in the paste composition on chloride binding were confirmed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chloride binding; Coulombic attraction; Electrical double layer; Electrokinetics; Fly ash; Ground granulated blast furnace slags; Portland cement; Van der Waals interaction; Zeta potential","Blast furnaces; Curing; Electrodynamics; Electrohydrodynamics; Electromagnetic fields; Fly ash; Hydrated lime; Portland cement; Powders; Seawater; Slag cement; Slags; Sodium chloride; Sodium sulfate; Suspensions (fluids); Van der Waals forces; Zeta potential; Chloride binding; Coulombic attractions; Electrical double layers; Electrokinetics; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Van Der Waals interactions; Magnesium compounds","","","This work was supported by Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Infrastructure maintenance, renovation and management (Funding agency: JST ).","undefined, (2016); undefined, (2011); Koleva, D.

However, the origin of ferromagnetism with high TC remains to be elucidated. Here, we use soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) to investigate the valence-band (VB) structure of (Ga0.95,Fe0.05)Sb including the Fe-3d impurity band (IB), to unveil the mechanism of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Fe)Sb. We find that the VB dispersion in (Ga0.95,Fe0.05)Sb observed by SX-ARPES is similar to that of GaSb, indicating that the doped Fe atoms hardly affect the band dispersion. The Fe-3d resonant ARPES spectra demonstrate that the Fe-3d IB crosses the Fermi level (EF) and hybridizes with the VB of GaSb. These observations indicate that the VB structure of (Ga0.95,Fe0.05)Sb is consistent with that of the IB model which is based on double-exchange interaction between the localized 3d electrons of the magnetic impurities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Antimony compounds; Dispersions; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Gallium compounds; III-V semiconductors; Magnetic semiconductors; Photoelectron spectroscopy; X rays; 3d electron; Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy; Band dispersions; Double exchange interactions; Ferromagnetic semiconductor; Impurity bands; Magnetic impurity; Spintronic device; Iron compounds","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Grants No. 15H02109, No. 16H02095, No. 17H04922, No. 18H05345, and No. 23000010), Core-to-Core Program A.

The dielectric gate layer functioned as an insulator in the dark and as a charge generator and/or conductive layer under photoirradiation, which resulted in a low program voltage and an operation with long-term stability. A shift in the phototransistor threshold voltage could be reversibly tuned from −5.8 to 6.2 V with a low switching voltage (≤8 V) under UV irradiation. Programmed/erased states were obtained by applying gate pulse voltages of −8/5 V under UV irradiation from an external light source. The phototransistor memory exhibited high stability with a large on/off current ratio of ~105 for a retention time up to 2 × 106 s with a reliability greater than 103 programming/erasing testing cycles.

In this study, aerosols and their precursor gas were collected by NILU filter pack at two distinct urban sites during the winter and summer in Osaka, Japan and dry and rainy seasons in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. The aims are to investigate the contribution of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) to PM<inf>2.5</inf>, thermodynamic characterization and possible formation pathway of secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA). The PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration in Osaka (15.8 μg/m3) is lower than that in HCMC (23.0 μg/m3), but the concentration of WSIIs in Osaka (9.0 μg/m3) is two times higher than that in HCMC (4.1 μg/m3). Moreover, SIA including NH<inf>4</inf> +, NO<inf>3</inf> − and SO<inf>4</inf> 2− are major components in WSIIs accounting for 90% and 76% (in molar) in Osaka and HCMC, respectively. Thermodynamic models were used to understand the thermodynamic characterization of urban aerosols. Overall, statistical analysis results indicate that very good agreement (R2 > 0.8) was found for all species, except for nitrate aerosol in HCMC. We found that when the crustal species present at high amount, those compositions should be included in model calculation (i.e. in the HCMC situation). Finally, we analyzed the characteristics of NH<inf>4</inf> +– NO<inf>3</inf> −– SO<inf>4</inf> 2− system. A possible pathway to produce fine nitrate aerosol in Osaka is via the homogeneous reaction between NH<inf>3</inf> and HNO<inf>3</inf>, while non-volatile nitrate aerosols can be formed by the heterogeneous reactions in HCMC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","PM2.5; Thermodynamic model; Water-soluble inorganic ions","Air quality; Ammonia; Developing countries; Ions; Nitrates; Thermodynamic properties; Urban growth; Heterogeneous reactions; Homogeneous reaction; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Thermodynamic characterization; Thermodynamic model; Water soluble inorganic ions; Aerosols; aerosol; aerosol composition; air quality; comparative study; inorganic matter; nitrate; particulate matter; regional climate; solubility; thermodynamics; urban atmosphere; Ho Chi Minh City; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Osaka [Kinki]; Osaka [Osaka (PRF)]; Viet Nam; ion; water; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; season; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Vietnam; Water","","water, 7732-18-5; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Ions; Particulate Matter; Water","This research was partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency , the Japan International Cooperation Agency , and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS project entitled “Multi-Beneficial Measure for Mitigation of Climate Change in Vietnam and Indochina Countries by Development of Biomass Energy”).","Adams, Peter J., General circulation model assessment of direct radiative forcing by the sulfate-nitrate-ammonium-water inorganic aerosol system, Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, 1, pp. 1097-1111, (2001); Ansari, Asif S., An Analysis of Four Models Predicting the Partitioning of Semivolatile Inorganic Aerosol Components, Aerosol Science and Technology, 31, 2-3, pp. 129-153, (1999); Bäumer, Dominique, Relationship of visibility, aerosol optical thickness and aerosol size distribution in an ageing air mass over South-West Germany, Atmospheric Environment, 42, 5, pp. 989-998, (2008); Behera, Sailesh Narayan, Investigating the potential role of ammonia in ion chemistry of fine particulate matter formation for an urban environment, Science of the Total Environment, 408, 17, pp. 3569-3575, (2010); Behera, Sailesh Narayan, Degradation of SO2, NO2 and NH3 leading to formation of secondary inorganic aerosols: An environmental chamber study, Atmospheric Environment, 45, 24, pp. 4015-4024, (2011); Bressi, Michaël, A one-year comprehensive chemical characterisation of fine aerosol (PM2.5) at urban, suburban and rural background sites in the region of Paris (France), Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 13, 15, pp. 7825-7844, (2013); Clegg, Simon L., Thermodynamic model of the system H+-NH4+-SO42-NO 3--H2O at tropospheric temperatures, Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 102, 12, pp. 2137-2154, (1998); Dockery, Douglas W., Epidemiologic evidence of cardiovascular effects of particulate air pollution, Environmental Health Perspectives, 109, SUPPL. 4, pp. 483-486, (2001); Dominici, Francesca, Fine particulate air pollution and hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, JAMA, 295, 10, pp. 1127-1134, (2006); Climate Change 2007 the Physical Science Basis, (2007)","","Chinese Academy of Sciences P.O.

Although many projects are focused on biofuel production from these biomass resources, not much attention has been paid to developing an efficient utilization technology. Therefore, we started the present study investigated the optimal conditions for methane fermentation to achieve stable biogas production from the biomass feedstock of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This is the first report of using methanogenic bacteria in the shrimp pond sludge for the digestion of bagasse, molasses and coconut pomace, which were available biomass near the methane fermenter constructed beside shrimp pond at Bên Tre in Vietnam. As a result of a continuous input test of bagasse and molasses, the H2S concentration in the collected gas was increased to 600 ppm and finally it had reached to 1,600 ppm by continuing to supply molasses. Therefore, an input test using coconut pomace instead of molasses was started. As a result, the generation of H2S was reduced to several tens ppm. After a 118-day acclimatization test, biogas was generated smoothly. After then, a methane fermentation test using bagasse and coconut pomace was started.

Together with its benefits, this process also puts pressure on the environment, among which the increasing generation of construction and demolition waste (CDW) is an urgent issue. In this study, the authors conducted an in-depth investigation of various aspects in the generation and management of CDW in Vietnam. Firstly, part of the overall picture of CDW management in Vietnam was revealed in detail from the perspective of demolition contractors, one of the important stakeholders in the field. Their insights provide valuable information on current situation, practice, and attitude towards CDW recycling. Secondly, this paper reports the generation rate of different categories of materials from demolition sites of building structures in Ha-noi, Vietnam, with the main focus on crushed concrete and crushed brick (CC-CB) and steel as they make up the majority of the generated waste. In order to achieve two mentioned goals, close contact was constantly kept with a key collaborator – a renowned demolition contractor in Hanoi throughout the investigation.

Therefore, reducing the power consumption and increasing the processing rate for the double SHA-256 algorithm is currently an important research trend. In this paper, we propose a high-data-rate low-power hardware architecture named the compact message expander (CME) double SHA-256. The CME double SHA-256 architecture combines resource sharing and fully unrolled datapath technologies to achieve both a high data rate and low power consumption. Notably, the CME algorithm utilizes the double SHA-256 input data characteristics to further reduce the hardware cost and power consumption. A review of the literature shows that the CME algorithm eliminates at least 9.68% of the 32-bit XOR gates, 16.49% of the 32-bit adders, and 16.79% of the registers required to calculate double SHA-256. We synthesized and laid out the CME double SHA-256 using CMOS 0.18~\mu m technology. The hardware cost of the synthesized circuit is approximately 13.88% less than that of the conventional approach. The chip layout size is 5.9 mm \times 5.9 mm , and the correctness of the circuit was verified on a real hardware platform (ZCU 102). The throughput of the proposed architecture is 61.44 Gbps on an ASIC with Rohm 180nm CMOS standard cell library and 340 Gbps on a FinFET FPGA 16nm Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ASIC; Bitcoin mining; SHA-256; unrolling","Bitcoin; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric power utilization; System-on-chip; Conventional approach; Hardware architecture; Hardware platform; Low-power consumption; Lowpower hardware; Processing rates; Proposed architectures; Resource sharing; Network architecture","","","This work was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under the Strategic Basic Research Programs PRESTO Grant number 2019A039.","International Journal of Business Management and Commerce, (2016); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Rahouti, Mohamed, Bitcoin Concepts, Threats, and Machine-Learning Security Solutions, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 67189-67205, (2018); Vranken, Harald P.E., Sustainability of bitcoin and blockchains, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 28, pp. 1-9, (2017); Bitcoin and Turkey A Good Match or A Perfect Storm, (2019); Courtois, Nicolas T., Optimizing SHA256 in bitcoin mining, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 448 CCIS, pp. 131-144, (2014); Proc 3rd Int Conf Mechatronics Eng Inf Technol Icmeit, (2019); Rote, Manoj D., High performance SHA-2 core using the Round Pipelined Technique, (2016); Dadda, Luigi, The design of a high speed ASIC unit for the hash function SHA-256 (384, 512), pp. 70-75, (2004); Padhi, Meelu, An optimized pipelined architecture of SHA-256 hash function, 2018-January, pp. 1-4, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089602090"

Due to their economic feasibility, the use of locally available low-cost adsorbents has received much attention, especially in developing countries. The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of laterite grains made from crushing laterite brick in Vietnam (0.105-2 mm) for the removal of chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As) from wastewater. For comparison, commercially available zeolite and Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) grains were tested. A series of laboratory tests for examining the effects of the initial metal concentration, initial solution pH, background ion concentration (ionic strength), and solid-to-liquid (S:L) ratio on adsorption and desorption characteristics were carried out. The test results showed that the Langmuir model captured well all obtained data in concentration range of 0-2,000 mg/L for laterite grains, suggesting that monolayer adsorption dominantly occurred. The measured maximum adsorption capacities of laterite grains were 8.2 mg/g and 1.3 mg/g for As and Cr, and the laterite grains gave a relatively high As adsorption compared to previously reported materials. The removal efficiencies of Cr and As were dependent on initial pH and S:L ratio, and lower initial pH and S:L ratio gave higher removal % for all tested adsorbents. Based on the results for desorption tests, laterite grains gave a higher hysteresis index for As (480%) compared to those from zeolite (128%) and AAC (176%), indicating that the tested laterite in this study possessed a strong irreversibility for adsorbed As (i.e. As immobilization). Consequently, laterite grains have a high potential as a low-cost adsorbent for As removal from wastewater. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Arsenic; Chromium; Laterite; Wastewater","","","","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) (No. JPMJSA1701).

In this study, we conducted a field survey of VnP populations and analyzed interrelationships among their characteristics. We also established a relational database for management of field data on these populations. For data collection, we conducted interviews with farmers and visual inspection of 32 VnP populations in 22 provinces of Vietnam, as well as taking photographs of individual animals. Data on the characteristics of VnP populations were subjected to multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). For establishment of the database, normalization and table partitioning were performed to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency of the collected data items. Passport data, characteristics data, and image data were collected from a total of 1,918 VnPs and entered as a normalized table. Upon MCA, most of the populations were not separated from each other, but the Mong Cai, O Lam, and Chu Prong populations were separated from the other populations.

The proportion of blastomeres expressing SOX2 bi-allelically increased from 45% at the 4-cell stage to 60% at the 8-cell stage. Moreover, in 8-cell embryos, SOX2 was expressed bi-allelically in significantly more blastomeres than was the case for OCT4, and this was associated with a tendency for SOX2 alleles to move toward the nuclear interior during 4- to 8-cell transition. However, the radial location of OCT4 alleles did not change significantly during this transition. The locations of active and inactive alleles based on DNA and RNA FISH signals were also calculated.

Frozen-thawed Meishan epididymal spermatozoa showing moderate and high polyspermy were subjected to IVF (1 × 105 sperms/ml). Under conditions of moderate polyspermy, 4-cell embryos selected at 48 hr after IVF (single selection) and 8-cell embryos selected at 79 hr after IVF from the collected 4-cell embryos (double selection) showed high developmental competence. Likewise, 4- and 8-cell embryos produced by IVF under high polyspermy conditions also showed high competence for development to blastocysts. However, blastocysts derived from high polyspermy conditions had significantly fewer cells than those produced under moderate polyspermy conditions. Furthermore, the frequency of nuclear and chromosomal abnormalities in 4- and 8-cell embryos produced under conditions of high polyspermy was significantly (p <.05) higher in comparison to moderate polyspermy conditions. These findings suggest that although high polyspermy affects the frequency of nuclear and chromosomal anomalies in porcine IVF embryos, subsequent selection based on morphological features of 4- and 8-cell embryos even under high polyspermy conditions, could be an alternative option for selecting porcine IVF embryos with high development ability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","abnormalities; chromosome; nucleus; polyspermy; porcine embryos","animal; blastocyst; chromosome aberration; cytology; embryo development; embryology; female; fertility; in vitro fertilization; male; physiology; pig; spermatozoon; veterinary medicine; Animals; Blastocyst; Chromosome Aberrations; Embryonic Development; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Male; Sperm-Ovum Interactions; Spermatozoa; Swine","","","Funding text 1: Hiep Thi Nguyen is a recipient of a Monbukagakusho scholarship from Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology for foreign PhD students (2016‐2020).

The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in partnership with national agricultural research institutes (NARIs), instigated breeding and agronomic research in Asia, 1983. The breeding program has successfully released high-yielding cultivars resulting in an average yield increase from 13.0 t ha–1 in 1996 to 21.3 t ha–1 in 2016, with significant economic benefits. Following the success in increasing yields, cassava breeding has turned its focus to higher-value traits, such as waxy cassava, to reach new market niches. More recently, building resistance to invasive pests and diseases has become a top priority due to the emergent threat of cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The agronomic research involves driving profitability with advanced technologies focusing on better agronomic management practices thereby maintaining sustainable production systems. Remote sensing technologies are being tested for trait discovery and large-scale field evaluation of cassava. In summary, cassava breeding in Asia is driven by a combination of food and market demand with technological innovations to increase the productivity. Further, exploration in the potential of data-driven agriculture is needed to empower researchers and producers for sustainable advancement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agronomy; Asia; Cassava; CMD; Conventional breeding; Data-driven agriculture; New breeding techniques","","","","We express our gratitude to everyone who has contributed to cassava development in Asia.

In order to confirm our previous results and compare with the results of a previous study using microsatellite (MS) markers, we aimed to characterize genetic diversity and population structure in wider varieties (24 breeds from 21 Provinces) of VNP across the country using 20 polymorphic MS markers recommended by ISAG/FAO (International Society for Animal Genetics/Food and Agriculture Organization) for diversity study. In this study, we collected 1,136 DNA samples of the VNPs and three exotic breeds. Our results revealed that the average number of alleles and allelic richness across the loci in VNPs were 10.0 and 7.6, which were higher than those of exotic breeds. Genomic components among VNPs were subjected to the sampling locations. Interestingly, Co Binh Thuan showed remarkable genetic feature compared to the other VNPs, because the habitation of Co Binh Thuan was relatively far from the other breeds. The results of this study provided useful information for exploitation, conservation, and development trends of the VNP breeds. More recently, African swine fever caused significant damage to most of the VNP populations. Therefore, our findings will help a reconstruction scheme of the VNP genetic resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","genetic diversity; microsatellite marker; phylogenetic analysis; pig; Vietnam","microsatellite DNA; allele; animal; breeding; genetic variation; genetics; pig; single nucleotide polymorphism; Viet Nam; Alleles; Animals; Breeding; Genetic Variation; Microsatellite Repeats; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Swine; Vietnam","","","This research was partially supported by Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) [JPMJSA1404].","Berthouly-Salazar, Cécile, Uncontrolled admixture and loss of genetic diversity in a local vietnamese pig breed, Ecology and Evolution, 2, 5, pp. 962-975, (2012); Boitard, Simon B., Genetic variability, structure and assignment of Spanish and French pig populations based on a large sampling, Animal Genetics, 41, 6, pp. 608-618, (2010); Chang, W.

First, we investigated genetic polymorphisms in β- and γ-like PERVs, and we then measured the copy numbers of infectious γ-like PERVs (PERV-A, B, and C). We purified genomic DNA from 15 VnP breeds from 12 regions all over the country and three Western pig breeds as controls, and investigated genetic polymorphisms in all known PERVs, including the beta (β)1–4 and gamma (γ)1–5 groups. PERVs of β1, β2, β3, and γ4 were highly polymorphic with VnP-specific haplotypes. We did not identify genetic polymorphisms in β4, γ1, or γ2 PERVs. We then applied a real-time polymerase chain reaction–based method to estimate copy numbers of the gag, pol, and env genes of γ1 PERVs (defined as A, B, and C). VnP breeds showed significantly lower copy number of the PERV genes compared with the Western pig breeds (on average, 16.2 and 35.7 copies, respectively, p <.05). Two VnP breeds showed significantly higher copy number compared with the other VnPs (p <.05). Our results elucidated that VnPs have specific haplotypes and a low copy number of PERV genes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","copy number variation; haplotype analysis; native pigs; porcine endogenous retrovirus; Vietnam","animal; gene dosage; genetic polymorphism; genetics; haplotype; pig; Retroviridae; Viet Nam; virology; virus genome; Animals; Gene Dosage; Genome, Viral; Haplotypes; Polymorphism, Genetic; Swine; Vietnam","GENBANK: LC506225, LC506233","","This research was partially supported by Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) [JPMJSA1404].","Belshaw, Robert D., Rate of recombinational deletion among human endogenous retroviruses, Journal of Virology, 81, 17, pp. 9437-9442, (2007); Ericsson, Thomas A., Identification of novel porcine endogenous betaretrovirus sequences in miniature swine, Journal of Virology, 75, 6, pp. 2765-2770, (2001); Goodchild, Nancy L., Spliced HERV-H endogenous retroviral sequences in human genomic DNA: Evidence for amplification via retrotransposition, Virology, 206, 1, pp. 164-173, (1995); Harrison, Ian, Determinants of high titer in recombinant porcine endogenous retroviruses, Journal of Virology, 78, 24, pp. 13871-13879, (2004); Hongo, Hitomi, Variation in mitochondrial DNA of Vietnamese pigs: Relationships with Asian domestic pigs and Ryukyu wild boars, Zoological Science, 19, 11, pp. 1329-1335, (2002); Ishihara, Shinya, Genetic relationships among Vietnamese local pigs investigated using genome-wide SNP markers, Animal Genetics, 49, 1, pp. 86-89, (2018); Jamain, Stéphane, Transduction of the human gene FAM8A1 by endogenous retrovirus during primate evolution, Genomics, 78, 1-2, pp. 38-45, (2001); Lai, Liangxue, Production of α-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout pigs by nuclear transfer cloning, Science, 295, 5557, pp. 1089-1092, (2002); Larson, Greger, Worldwide phylogeography of wild boar reveals multiple centers of pig domestication, Science, 307, 5715, pp. 1618-1621, (2005); Larson, Greger, Patterns of East Asian pig domestication, migration, and turnover revealed by modern and ancient DNA, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, 17, pp. 7686-7691, (2010)","","Blackwell Publishing","","","","","","13443941; 17400929","","","32219916","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080983587"

In constant TMP mode, flux and organic loading rate dynamically change, while they are rather static in constant flux mode. This study investigated fouling mechanism in MBR under these different filtration modes. Fouling development was more significant in constant TMP mode than in constant flux mode when MBR was operated under an equal flux condition in average. In constant TMP mode, microbial community in cake sludge was distinct from bulk sludge and had higher abundance of biofilm-forming bacterial group. The cake sludge contained more SMP and LB-EPS with high polysaccharide contents in constant TMP mode. These results suggested that, in constant TMP mode, (i) initially high flux in a filtration cycle enhanced initial deposition of bacterial cells and rapid development of fouling layer, which resulted in distinct microbial community in cake sludge; (ii) the high abundance of the biofilm-forming bacteria in cake sludge and fluctuation of organic loading rate stimulated polysaccharide production, (iii) higher polysaccharide contents in cake layer caused faster development of fouling layer and increase of hydraulic resistance by compression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial community; Bulk sludge; Cake sludge; Constant flux operation; Extracellular polymeric substances; Filtration mode; Membrane fouling","Bacteria; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Bacterial community; Bulk sludge; Cake sludge; Constant fluxes; Extra-cellular polymeric substances; Filtration modes; Microfiltration; bacterial polysaccharide; Article; bacterial cell; biofouling; filter cake; hydraulic conductivity; membrane resistance; microbial community; nonhuman; pressure; priority journal; reactor operation; sludge; Development; Filtration; Fouling; Loading; Sludge; Thermomechanical Pulps","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists A (Grant No. 15H05535 ), Fostering Joint International Research (Grant No. 16KK0146 ), JST Mirai Program (Grant No. JPMJMI18DC ) and Kurita Water and Environment Foundation.

Repeated pressurization from intermittent operation in households is suspected to have an adverse effect on RO. This study aimed to evaluate virus removal by RO used in actual households as well as the water quality of permeate, and to elucidate the main cause of RO deterioration. We conducted a survey in households in Hanoi, Vietnam, to collect 27 membranes along with their usage history, where virus removal was investigated in laboratory. Of the used RO membranes, 22% did not show the protective level, >3 log<inf>10</inf> (99.9%) virus removal, recommended by World Health Organization. The differences in virus removal among Aichi virus, MS2 and φX-174 were <0.5 log<inf>10</inf>. All membranes with estimated pressurization times of <4000 showed >3 log<inf>10</inf> virus removal, while 17% of membranes used for <3 years, the manufacturers' warranty period, did not achieve the criterion. Therefore, virus removal performance may not be assured even if the users replace the membrane following the warranty period. Furthermore, more pressurized membranes exhibited significantly lower virus removal than less pressurized ones, suggesting a major role of repeated pressurization in the deterioration of RO. Coliforms were detected from 44% of the permeate of the point-of-use devices applying RO (RO-POU), raising concerns on the extrinsic contamination and regrowth of bacteria. Consequently, RO in households may deteriorate more rapidly than the manufactures' expectation due to repeated pressurization. RO in households should be replaced based on not only membrane age but also total pressurized times (i.e., 4000 times) to keep the protective level of virus removal. The deteriorated bacterial quality in RO permeate suggested the need for installing post-treatment, such as UV irradiation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Household water treatment; Membrane deterioration; Repeated pressurization; Reverse osmosis; Virus","Irradiation; Membranes; Potable water; Pressurization; Reverse osmosis; Viruses; Water quality; Water treatment; Household water; Intermittent operation; Point-of-use devices; Pressurized membrane; Safe drinking water; UV irradiation; Warranty period; World Health Organization; Deterioration; coliform bacterium; domestic waste; membrane; regrowth; reverse osmosis; virus; water quality; Aichi virus; Article; bacterial growth; bacteriophage phi X 174; controlled study; Enterobacteria phage MS2; Escherichia coli; household; nonhuman; physical chemistry; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; purification; repeated pressurization; ultraviolet irradiation; Viet Nam; virus removal; water treatment; artificial membrane; devices; filtration; osmosis; procedures; virology; water management; Hanoi; Bacteria (microorganisms); drinking water; Drinking Water; Filtration; Membranes, Artificial; Osmosis; Water Purification; Water Quality","","Drinking Water; Membranes, Artificial","This work was partially supported by JST, CREST , JPMJCR1422 and the Bureau of Waterworks, Tokyo Metropolitan Government .","Antony, Alice Arul, Assessing the oxidative degradation of polyamide reverse osmosis membrane-Accelerated ageing with hypochlorite exposure, Journal of Membrane Science, 347, 1-2, pp. 159-164, (2010); Antony, Alice Arul, Removal efficiency and integrity monitoring techniques for virus removal by membrane processes, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 42, 9, pp. 891-933, (2012); Antony, Alice Arul, Impact of membrane ageing on reverse osmosis performance – Implications on validation protocol, Journal of Membrane Science, 520, pp. 37-44, (2016); Arkhangelsky, Elizabeth, Effect of transmembrane pressure on rejection of viruses by ultrafiltration membranes, Separation and Purification Technology, 62, 3, pp. 619-628, (2008); Attinti, Ramesh, Virus' (MS2, PdblX174, and Aichi) attachment on sand measured by atomic force microscopy and their transport through sand columns, Environmental Science and Technology, 44, 7, pp. 2426-2432, (2010); Barstow, Christina K., Assessing point-of-use ultraviolet disinfection for safe water in urban developing communities, Journal of Water and Health, 12, 4, pp. 663-669, (2014); Brié, Adrien, The Effect of Heat on the Physicochemical Properties of Bacteriophage MS2, Food and Environmental Virology, 8, 4, pp. 251-261, (2016); Canh, Vu Duc, Impact of various humic acids on EMA-RT-qPCR to selectively detect intact viruses in drinking water, Journal of Water and Environment Technology, 16, 2, pp. 83-93, (2018); Canh, Vu Duc, Viability RT-qPCR Combined with Sodium Deoxycholate Pre-treatment for Selective Quantification of Infectious Viruses in Drinking Water Samples, Food and Environmental Virology, 11, 1, pp. 40-51, (2019); Ida J Desalin Water Reuse, (2013)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00489697; 18791026","","STEVA","31421339","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070640981"

This study examined the expression of root plasticity and its function for water and N uptake and the maintenance in shoot dry matter production triggered by mild drought with variable rates of N and SC. A chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL50) and its recurrent parent, Nipponbare, were grown under continuously waterlogged (CWL, control) and water deficit (WD; 20% soil moisture content, SMC) conditions. Nitrogen treatments at the rate of 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 mg N per box were used in Experiment 1 and at 30, 60 and 120 mg N per box in Experiment 2. The fertilizers were mixed well with air-dried sandy loam soil set either at bulk density of l.25 (light soil compaction) or 1.50 g cm-3 (heavy soil compaction) prior to sowing. Under CWL, shoot dry weight (SDW) and total root length (TRL) were not significantly different between CSSL50 and Nipponbare regardless of the rates of N and SC. Under WD, however, SDW and TRL were significantly greater in CSSL50 than in Nipponbare but the magnitude of differences varied with rates of N and SC. The genotypic differences in SDW between CSSL50 and Nipponbare were greater at high than at low N regardless of SC treatments. This result was partially attributed to the longer TRL of CSSL50 than that of Nipponbare at high N regardless of SC treatments, which consequently contributed to the greater water and N uptake of the former than the latter genotype. Longer TRL in CSSL50 than in Nipponbare was more pronounced at heavy than at light SC at 30, 60 and 120 mg N rates, due to the maintained TRL in the former but reduced TRL in the latter genotype under heavy SC. These results imply that the developmental plasticity of root system triggered by WD can be also expressed with greater magnitude under a more compacted soil with high N rate and contributed to the maintenance in dry matter production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drought; Dry matter production; Nitrogen; Rice; Root plasticity; Soil compaction","","","","This research was funded by the Grant-in-Aid Scientific Research (No. 22405042) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology (JST)/ Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).","Ahmad, Nabeela, Effects of soil compaction in the sub-humid cropping environment in Pakistan on uptake of NPK and grain yield in wheat (Triticum aestivum).

We show that the total MA energy (E⊥) along the [001] direction changes its sign from positive (in-plane) to negative (perpendicular) with increasing d above an effective critical value dC∗∼42nm. We reveal that (Ga,Fe)Sb has twofold symmetry in the film plane. Meanwhile, in the plane perpendicular to the film including the in-plane [110] axis, the twofold symmetry with the easy magnetization axis along [110] changes to fourfold symmetry with the easy magnetization axis along (001) with increasing d. This peculiar behavior is different from that of (Ga,Mn)As, in which only the in-plane MA depends on the film thickness and has fourfold symmetry due to its dominant cubic anisotropy along the (100) axes.

We also further investigated optical properties of the fabricated free-standing Al bowtie plasmonic dark-field scattering mapping, which revealed the resonance of each individual antenna in antennas by introducing a plasmonic dark-field scattering mapping, which revealed the resonance the range between 500 nm–675 nm. Despite of having a natural oxide Al2O3 layer, and the absence of of each individual antenna in the range between 500 nm–675 nm. Despite of having a natural oxide the chemical SERS effect, the correlated SERS mapping of Nile-blue molecules on Al bowties excited Al2O3 layer, and the absence of the chemical SERS effect, the correlated SERS mapping of Nile-blue by a 532-nm laser clearly showed that the SERS signals were observed only at the bowtie antenna molecules on Al bowties excited by a 532-nm laser clearly showed that the SERS signals were position. This evidences that the free-standing Al bowties exhibited a high SERS performance owing observed only at the bowtie antenna position. This evidences that the free-standing Al bowties to the strongly confined electromagnetic field at the nanogaps between each triangle-pair of the bowtie exhibited a high SERS performance owing to the strongly confined electromagnetic field at the antennas.

The size of oocytes in the two breeds was similar. However, significantly lower amounts of intracellular lipid were detected in Ban oocytes. There was no difference (p > 0.05) between Ban and Landrace × Large white oocytes in percentages of post-warming survival (93.1 ± 3.4% vs. 70.7 ± 16.7%, respectively) and nuclear maturation after in vitro maturation (80.4 ± 5.1% vs. 90.0 ± 1.3% respectively).

The RO membranes for HWT (residential RO) are typically operated intermittently without a cleaning process. This suggests that a unique mechanism of membrane deterioration, membrane oxidation, one of the main causes of RO membrane deterioration in industrial settings (desalination and wastewater reclamation), is not involved. Furthermore, the intermittent operation provides repeated shear stress on the membrane surface. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of repeated pressurization on virus (bacteriophage MS2 and φX-174) removal by residential RO and to determine the location of integrity loss. We repeatedly pressurized and de-pressurized spiral-wound residential RO membranes for up to 10:000 cycles, while periodically evaluating virus removal. E. coli removal was also determined after 10:000 cycles. Moreover, these membranes were examined for virus and E. coli removal in a flat-sheet configuration. For the first 3000-4000 cycles, φX-174 removal was maintained at approximately 4 log<inf>10</inf> (99.99%), and then dramatically decreased. After 10:000 cycles, even E. coli leaked from the membrane. The deterioration of virus removal in a flat-sheet configuration indicates integrity loss at the membrane surface.

There were no significant differences in DMP between NERICA 1 and 4 under well-watered, mild drought, and severe drought conditions regardless of N level. In contrast, under moderate drought (12–21% v/v of soil moisture content [SMC] in 2011 and 16–24% v/v of SMC in 2012), NERICA 1 had significantly higher shoot dry weight, total root length (TRL), lateral root length, and branching index than NERICA 4 at medium and high N; however, there was no significant difference between the two NERICAs in DMP at low N. TRL of NERICA 1 was significantly higher under moderate drought than well-watered conditions, but only with medium and high N. Regardless of N level, moderate drought did not enhance NERICA 4’s root system. Thus, NERICA 1’s root system exhibited plastic development, promoting lateral root branching at medium and high N. These morphological changes were associated with the greater DMP in NERICA 1 than NERICA 4 under moderate drought, whereas the lack of such plasticity at low N meant genotypic differences in DMP were obscured. Our findings implied that N application can improve upland NERICA productivity under moderate drought conditions, but differences in variety and field conditions may influence efficacy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Moderate drought; nitrogen (N); root plasticity; shoot dry weight (SDW); upland∙NERICA","","","","This work was supported by the Strategic Funds for the Promotion of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).","Araki, Hideki, Physiol-morphological analysis on axile root growth in upland rice, Plant Production Science, 5, 4, pp. 286-293, (2002); Balasubramanian, Vethaiya, Increasing Rice Production in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges and Opportunities, Advances in Agronomy, 94, pp. 55-133, (2007); Banoc, Dionisio M., Dry matter production and root system development of rice cultivars under fluctuating soil moisture, Plant Production Science, 3, 2, pp. 197-207, (2000); Becker, Mathias, Rice yield gaps in irrigated systems along an agro-ecological gradient in West Africa, Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science, 166, 1, pp. 61-67, (2003); Bouma, Tjeerd Joris, Sample preparation and scanning protocol for computerised analysis of root length and diameter, Plant and Soil, 218, 1-2, pp. 185-196, (2000); Cairns, Jill E., Influence of the soil physical environment on rice (Oryza sativa L.) response to drought stress and its implications for drought research, Field Crops Research, 121, 3, pp. 303-310, (2011); Agron J, (1992); Nerica Success Story Development Achievements and Lessons Learned, (2010); Dingkuhn, Michael, Growth and yield potential of Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima upland rice cultivars and their interspecific progenies, Field Crops Research, 57, 1, pp. 57-69, (1998); Fan, Jianbo, Root Physiological and Morphological Characteristics of Two Rice Cultivars with Different Nitrogen-Use Efficiency, Pedosphere, 20, 4, pp. 446-455, (2010)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13491008; 1343943X","","PPTSF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060436156"

We establish a procedure to extract pure AMPE and AEE contributions, separated from other thermoelectric effects, for ferromagnetic thin films. The measurements of the magnetic-field-angle θH dependence of the LIT images clearly show that the temperature modulation induced by the AMPE (AEE) in the Ni films varies with a cos2θH (cosθH) pattern, confirming the symmetry of the AMPE (AEE). The systematic LIT measurements with various substrates show that the AMPE-induced temperature modulation decreases with the increase in thermal conductivity of the substrates, whereas the AEE-induced temperature modulation is almost independent of the thermal conductivity, indicating that the heat loss into the substrates plays an important role in determining the magnitude of the AMPE-induced temperature modulation in thin films. Our experimental results are reproduced by numerical calculations based on a two-dimensional finite-element method. These findings provide a platform for investigating the AMPE and AEE in thin-film devices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Anisotropy; Ferromagnetic materials; Modulation; Numerical methods; Peltier effect; Substrates; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thin film devices; Ferromagnetic thin films; Induced temperature; Lockin thermography; Magnetic field angle; Numerical calculation; Temperature modulation; Two dimensional finite element method; Various substrates; Thin films","","","Funding text 1: The authors thank A.

Separation of 1–3 from dried 80% aqueous (aq.) ethanol extract was achieved on a reversed-phase cholester column packed with cholesteryl-bonded silica using an acetonitrile-0.1% aq. formic acid mobile phase system. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy was employed for detection of compounds, and their contents were determined by measuring absorbance at 254 nm. Depending on the above system, several factors potentially affecting the concentration of tetracyclic iridoids were evaluated resulting in several variation on plant organs, seasonality, variation between individual trees, and branch positions within the trees. Moreover, we developed a simple, quick, and effective method for tetracyclic iridoid isolation from M. lucida leaves that consisted of extraction by sonication into 80% aq. ethanol, basic hydrolysis, acid neutralization, liquid-liquid extraction into an organic solvent, and reverse phase open column chromatography. Employing this method, we have succeeded to obtain 1 as a colorless crystal yielding of 0.23%, which was 28 times higher than that of previous isolation method. Setting up methodology in this paper may be important for future in vitro and in vivo studies of tetracyclic iridoids and moreover for their applications in new drug design and development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-leishmania; Anti-trypanosoma; Isolation; Morinda lucida; Quantitative analysis; Tetracyclic iridoids","acetic acid ethyl ester; acetonitrile; alcohol; antileishmanial agent; antitrypanosomal agent; formic acid; hydrochloric acid; iridoid; methanol; ml 2 3; ml f52; molucidin; Morinda lucida extract; plant extract; silicon dioxide; sodium hydroxide; unclassified drug; solvent; absorption; aqueous solution; Article; calibration; column chromatography; concentration (parameters); correlation coefficient; crystal; drug isolation; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrolysis; intermethod comparison; linear system; liquid liquid extraction; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; Morinda lucida; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant root; plant stem; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; retention time; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; seasonal variation; tree; ultrasound; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; validation process; chemistry; devices; drug design; drug effect; fractionation; isolation and purification; Morinda; procedures; qualitative research; Trypanosoma; validation study; Chemical Fractionation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Design; Iridoids; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Qualitative Research; Solvents; Trypanocidal Agents","","acetic acid ethyl ester, 141-78-6; acetonitrile, 75-05-8; alcohol, 64-17-5; formic acid, 64-18-6, 71-47-6; hydrochloric acid, 7647-01-0; methanol, 67-56-1; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2; Iridoids; Plant Extracts; Solvents; Trypanocidal Agents","This research is supported by Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) grant from the Japan Science and Agency (JST) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) (2010 to 2015) and the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infection Diseases (J-GRID) from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology (MEXT) in Japan (2015 to present).","Journal of Natural Products, (2012); Anti-diabetic effect of Morinda lucida stem bark extracts on alloxan-induced diabetic rats, 4, 3, pp. 78-82; Adesida, George A., Oruwal, a novel dihydroanthraquinone pigment from Morinda lucida Benth., Journal of the Chemical Society D: Chemical Communications, 0, 7, pp. 405-406, (1972); Adv Nat Appl Sci, (2008); Olajide, Olumayokun A., Evaluation of the anti-diabetic property of Morinda lucida leaves in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, 51, 11, pp. 1321-1324, (1999); Ajaiyeoba, Edith Oriabure, In vitro cytotoxicity studies of 20 plants used in Nigerian antimalarial ethnomedicine, Phytomedicine, 13, 4, pp. 295-298, (2006); Ogundare, Ayodele Oluwayemisi, The antimicrobial activity of Morinda lucida leaf extract on Escherichia coli, Journal of Medicinal Plants Research, 3, 4, pp. 319-323, (2009); Asuzu, I.

We observed two peaks in the infrared MCD spectra that can be explained by the optical transitions related to the Fermi level (E <inf>F</inf> ) located in an Fe-related impurity band (IB) in the bandgap. As x increases, the energy shifts of the two peaks suggest that the Fe-related IB extends into the bandgap and E <inf>F</inf> rises correspondingly. Furthermore, the mobility of hole carriers in these (Ga,Fe)Sb thin films estimated by Hall measurements is very low (0.2-2 cm 2 /Vs), which is consistent with our conclusion that the hole carriers and E <inf>F</inf> reside in the IB rather than in the valence band.

We show that to improve the accuracy, the initial complex state should be decomposed into the real and imaginary parts and stored in an extended state (rebit) which can be tracked individually by two bases of an extra qubit. For pure states, the numerical calculations show that the trace distances between the true state and the reconstructed state obtained from the rebit method are more precise than those ones obtained from the usual DSM and quantum state tomography (SQT) because the number of projective measurements is reduced. For mixed states, the rebit method gives the same accuracy in comparison to the usual DSM, while it is less precise than QST. Its precision is also significantly improved when using nearly-pure states. Our proposal holds promises as a reliable tool for quantum computation, testing of quantum circuits by using only real amplitudes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Direct state measurement; Rebit; Weak value","Hilbert spaces; Numerical methods; Quantum computers; Vector spaces; Numerical calculation; Projective measurement; Quantum state tomography; Real and imaginary; Rebit; State measurements; Trace distances; Weak values; Quantum theory","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Yasushi Kondo of Kindai University for useful discussion.

Five BC<inf>3</inf>F<inf>3</inf> populations were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and seven BC<inf>3</inf>F<inf>4</inf> populations for QTL validation. Four significant QTLs on the long arm of chromosome 2 (qGRH2), short arm of chromosome 4 (qGRH4), short arm of chromosome 5 (qGRH5), and long arm of chromosome 11 (qGRH11) were identified. The contribution of the W1413 allele at qGRH11 was the largest among the four QTLs; the other QTLs also contributed to GRH resistance. Chromosomal locations suggested that qGRH11 corresponds to the previously reported GRH resistance gene Grh2, qGRH4 to Grh6, and qGRH5 to Grh1. qGRH2 is a novel QTL for resistance to GRH. Thus, resistance of O. longistaminata to GRH can be explained by at least four QTLs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic basis; Green rice leafhopper; Introgression line (IL); Oryza longistaminata; Quantitative trait locus (QTL)","","","","We are grateful to the Biotron Application Center, Kyushu University, for the use of the Entomotron in our antibiosis tests.

All annual mean concentrations at the exposed sites exceeded the value limits of the Vietnamese standard (25 µg m–3) and World Health Organization air quality guideline (10 µg m–3), indicating high health risk at these sites. Although the sampling sites varied in their exposure levels, they exhibited very strong correlations and low differences in PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels. Diurnal variation with a pronounced peak 2 hours after the morning rush hour was observed. This peak is likely attributable to not only primary sources (e.g., traffic-related sources) but also secondary aerosol formation. The urban atmosphere of HCMC was affected by strong local emission sources, as evidenced by the pronounced peak during morning rush hour as well as the significant negative correlation between PM<inf>2.5</inf> and wind speed. In addition, monthly PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels exhibited remarkable seasonal variability, with the lowest and highest levels observed during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. However, elevated PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels were observed during the months with heavy rains, highlighting the influence of strong emission sources, likely the biomass burning of rice straw residues in the Mekong Delta area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ho Chi Minh City; PM2.5; Tropical climate; Urban air pollution","Air quality; Health risks; Wind; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Gravimetric methods; Negative correlation; PM2.5 concentration; Seasonal variability; Strong correlation; World Health Organization; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; air sampling; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; concentration (composition); health risk; particulate matter; seasonal variation; urban atmosphere; Ho Chi Minh City; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors thank the Ho Chi Minh Department of Science and Technology for its support in this research under Grant No. 120/2017/HĐ-SKHCN and Japan Science and Technology Agency and Japan International Cooperation Agency, Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development for the SATREPS project entitled “Multi-beneficial measure for mitigation of climate change in Vietnam and Indochina countries by development of biomass energy.” The authors gratefully acknowledge the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory for the provision of the HYSPLIT transport and dispersion model and READY website (http://www.ready.noaa.gov) used in this study.; Funding text 2: The authors thank the Ho Chi Minh Department of Science and Technology for its support in this research under Grant No. 120/2017/H?-SKHCN and Japan Science and Technology Agency and Japan International Cooperation Agency, Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development for the SATREPS project entitled ?Multi-beneficial measure for mitigation of climate change in Vietnam and Indochina countries by development of biomass energy.?

Consistent with other studies, we found that viruses of clade 2.3.2.1c were dominant in Vietnam in 2013 and circulated in the northern, central, and southern parts of the country. Phylogenetic analysis revealed reassortment among viruses of clades 2.3.2.1a, 2.3.2.1b, and 2.3.2.1c; in contrast, no reassortment was detected between clade 2.3.2.1 viruses and viruses of clades 1.1.2 or 2.3.4.1, respectively.

CNT yarn-reinforced epoxy composites were developed using a resin drop method. Waviness and poor packing of CNTs in the untwisted spun yarns have limited the mechanical properties of the yarns and their composites. Therefore, pressing along with sliding was applied to create thin-twisted yarns with dense packing of the CNTs. Besides, stretching and tensioning techniques were applied to the twisted yarns to reduce twist angle as well as waviness of the CNTs and their bundles. Stretching and tensioning of the press-slid yarns under constant loads of 0.15, 0.25, 0.35 N enhanced the mechanical properties of the yarns significantly. Moreover, stretching and tensioning of the press-slid CNT yarns increased the mechanical properties of the yarn composites considerably. However, tensioning of the press-slid yarns is more effective than their stretching. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon nanotube; mechanical properties; nano composites; spun yarn","Carbon nanotubes; Epoxy resins; Mechanical properties; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Presses (machine tools); Wool; Yarn; Constant loads; Dense packing; Property improvement; Reinforced epoxy; Twist angles; Vertically aligned CNT arrays; Spinning (fibers)","","","We appreciate financial support from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) through the Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program (ALCA) and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) through the ISAS strategic development fund for space engineering.","Ruoff, Rodney S., Mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes, Carbon, 33, 7, pp. 925-930, (1995); Treacy, Michael M.J., Exceptionally high Young's modulus observed for individual carbon nanotubes, Nature, 381, 6584, pp. 678-680, (1996); Demczyk, Brian G., Direct mechanical measurement of the tensile strength and elastic modulus of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 334, 1-2, pp. 173-178, (2002); Thostenson, Erik T., Advances in the science and technology of carbon nanotubes and their composites: A review, Composites Science and Technology, 61, 13, pp. 1899-1912, (2001); Xie, Xiaoling Lin, Dispersion and alignment of carbon nanotubes in polymer matrix: A review, Materials Science and Engineering R: Reports, 49, 4, pp. 89-112, (2005); Kwon, Dongjun, Evaluation of optimal dispersion conditions for CNT reinforced epoxy composites using cyclic voltammetry measurements, Advanced Composite Materials, 26, 3, pp. 219-227, (2017); Park, Jung-eun, The effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes/hydroxyapatite nanocomposites on biocompatibility, Advanced Composite Materials, 27, 1, pp. 53-65, (2018); Inoue, Yoku, One-step grown aligned bulk carbon nanotubes by chloride mediated chemical vapor deposition, Applied Physics Letters, 92, 21, (2008); Lepró, Xavier, Spinnable carbon nanotube forests grown on thin, flexible metallic substrates, Carbon, 48, 12, pp. 3621-3627, (2010); Jiang, Kaili, Spinning continuous carbon nanotube yarns, Nature, 419, 6909, (2002)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","09243046; 15685519","","ACOAE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065407201"

In our Vietnam-Japan joint project contributing to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a shrimp farm in Ben Tre (Mekong Delta area) was selected as a demonstration site for an energy circulation system that includes a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). We found that sludge accumulated during intensive-shrimp culture can be used as a source of methanogenic bacteria to decompose lignocellulosic and starch-based biomass. Bagasse and coconut pomace are mixed with the shrimp pond water containing organic matter and minerals, then supplied to a digester with seed sludge (shrimp pond sludge) to produce biogas, which converted to electricity using the SOFC system. The green electricity is used for shrimp culture, main industry of this region. Based on this concept, a pilot plant with 1 kW SOFC system was constructed at the shrimp farm in Ben Tre. So far, stable biogas production necessary for the continuous operation of the 1 kW SOFC was achieved by the daily supply of 6 kg of bagasse and 8 kg of coconut pomace (dry basis), and power generation efficiency of 53.1% (LHV: lower heating value) was achieved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogas; Biomass Waste; Energy Circulation; Shrimp Culture; Solid Oxide Fuel Cell","Bagasse; Biogas; Biomass; Calorific value; Fuel cells; Lakes; Organic minerals; Pilot plants; Planning; Shellfish; Sustainable development; Biomass wastes; Circulation systems; Continuous operation; Demonstration sites; Green electricity; Lower heating value; Power generation efficiency; Shrimp culture; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)","","","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).","undefined, (2017); Nguyen, Quoc Cuong, Study and evaluation on sustainable industrial development in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 86, pp. 389-402, (2015); Shiratori, Yusuke, Biogas production from local biomass feedstock in the Mekong Delta and its utilization for a direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 5, MAY, (2017); Alves, Helton José, Overview of hydrogen production technologies from biogas and the applications in fuel cells, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 38, 13, pp. 5215-5225, (2013); Bocci, Enrico, Biomass to fuel cells state of the art: A review of the most innovative technology solutions, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 39, 36, pp. 21876-21895, (2014); Hansen, John Bogild, Correlating sulfur poisoning of SOFC nickel anodes by a temkin isotherm, Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 11, 10, pp. B178-B180, (2008); Sasaki, Kazunari, Chemical durability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of impurities on long-term performance, Journal of Power Sources, 196, 22, pp. 9130-9140, (2011); Rasmussen, Jens F.B., The effect of H2S on the performance of SOFCs using methane containing fuel, Fuel Cells, 10, 6, pp. 1135-1142, (2010); de Arespacochaga, N., Biogas deep clean-up based on adsorption technologies for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell applications, Chemical Engineering Journal, 255, pp. 593-603, (2014); Abatzoglou, Nicolas, A review of biogas purification processes, Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining, 3, 1, pp. 42-71, (2009)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd vgorayska@wiley.com Southern Gate Chichester, West Sussex PO19 8SQ","","","","","","16156846; 16156854","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064258612"

Some conventional countermeasures such as on load tap changer, step voltage regulator, etc. have been applied to mitigate the voltage problems. However, these methodologies might not be enough to cope with PV output fluctuation due to the limitation in the number of tap changing operations or slow response of tap changers. On the other hand, it seems promising to use PV inverter control to solve the problems when PV units are allowed to inject or absorb reactive power. In particular, there is a possibility that PV inverter control can contribute to VU problem even if they are connected with low voltage single phase networks. This paper proposed a comprehensive inverter control strategy consisting of both reactive power control and active power curtailment to improve the operation performance of VU in medium voltage distribution network with high penetration of residential PV systems by minimizing network losses and active power curtailment with voltage quality constraints.

To address the latter challenge (2), a compact SPL employing a rigid 76.2 mm caliber paraboloidal mirror and a 10 mm-long, 1 mm diameter Cr, Nd-doped YAG ceramic rod was developed to realize more stable oscillation performance by introducing rapid cooling by free/natural air convection and increased mechanical stability during wind exposure in contrast to the conventional large solar pumped lasers (SPLs) employing typically a 2 m size conversing lens or mirror. Arrays of the compact SPLs could be used for harvesting sunlight across a large area. Outdoor, solar tracking experimentation with the compact SPL yielded continuous oscillation exceeding 6.5 h, improving upon previously determined maximum continuous oscillation times of 11 min.

However, there may be additional, currently unknown, human adaptation polymerase mutations. Here, we used a database search of influenza virus H5N1 clade 1.1, clade 2.3.2.1 and clade 2.3.4 strains isolated from 2008–2012 in Southern China, Vietnam and Cambodia to identify polymerase adaptation mutations that had been selected in infected patients. Several of these mutations acted either alone or together to increase viral polymerase activity in human airway cells to levels similar to the PB2-D701N and PB2-E627K single mutations and to increase progeny virus yields in infected mouse lungs to levels similar to the PB2-D701N single mutation. In particular, specific mutations acted synergistically with the PB2-D701N mutation and showed synergistic effects on viral replication both in human airway cells and mice compared with the corresponding single mutations. Thus, H5N1 viruses in infected patients were able to acquire multiple polymerase mutations that acted cooperatively for human adaptation. Our findings give new insight into the human adaptation of AI viruses and help in avian influenza virus risk assessment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; airway cell; animal cell; animal experiment; article; avian influenza virus; Cambodia; China; cladistics; female; Influenza A virus (H5N1); lung; male; mouse; mutation; nonhuman; progeny; risk assessment; structural gene; Viet Nam; virus replication; A-549 cell line; adaptation; animal; Asia; bird; chemistry; epithelium cell; genetics; growth, development and aging; HEK293 cell line; human; isolation and purification; molecular model; pathology; virology; DNA directed RNA polymerase; A549 Cells; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Birds; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Epithelial Cells; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Lung; Mice; Models, Molecular; Mutation; Virus Replication","","DNA directed RNA polymerase; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases","We thank Akifumi Yamashita for computational assistance and resources.

Many factors have been shown to contribute to its pathogenesis including genetic and environmental factors. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is also known to be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. We herein modeled the study of UCHL1 in Drosophila melanogaster and investigated its functions in PD. The specific knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog of UCHL1 (dUCH) in dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) led to the underdevelopment and/or degeneration of these neurons, specifically in DL1 DA neuron cluster in the larval brain lobe and PPM2, PPM3, PPL2ab, and VUM DA neuron clusters in the adult brain. These defects were followed by a shortage of dopamine in the brain, which subsequently resulted in locomotor dysfunction. The degeneration of DA neurons in dUCH knockdown adult brain, which occurred progressively and severely during the course of aging, mimics the epidemiology of PD. DA neuron and locomotor defects were rescued when dUCH knockdown flies were treated with vitamin C, a well-known antioxidant. These results suggest that dUCH knockdown fly is a promising model for studying the pathogenesis and epidemiology of PD as well as the screening of potential antioxidants for PD therapeutics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","antioxidant; ascorbic acid; dopamine; Drosophila protein; ubiquitin thiolesterase; UCH protein, Drosophila; animal; disease model; dopaminergic nerve cell; Drosophila melanogaster; drug effect; gene knockdown; genetics; human; male; metabolism; oxidative stress; Parkinson disease; pathology; Animals; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine; Dopaminergic Neurons; Drosophila Proteins; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Male; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","","ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; ubiquitin thiolesterase, 86480-67-3; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Dopamine; Drosophila Proteins; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; UCH protein, Drosophila","We thank all members of the Fly Biomedical Research Group for fly food, their technical support, and helpful discussions.

YTH304 had greater root system below the hardpan than IR64 in hardpan with 1.50 but not in 1.70 g cm-3 bulk density (BD). YTH304 had greater plasticity in nodal root elongation through the hardpan than IR64 under SMF, which was clearly expressed during rewatering. YTH304 also had greater soil water uptake below the hardpan during drought and greater shoot growth than IR64. The results imply that deep root system development during SMF was due to the plasticity in nodal root elongation through the hardpan expressed during rewatering rather than during drought periods. This is against the long standing belief that active root elongation through the hardpan happens during drought. This also implies a need to revisit current root screening methods to identify rice lines with good hardpan penetration ability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","water; adaptation; clay; drought; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nodulation; Oryza; physiological stress; plant development; Adaptation, Physiological; Clay; Droughts; Plant Development; Root Nodules, Plant; Stress, Physiological; Water","","water, 7732-18-5; Clay; Water","This research was funded by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 15H02644) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).","Henry, Amelia, Variation in root system architecture and drought response in rice (Oryza sativa): Phenotyping of the OryzaSNP panel in rainfed lowland fields, Field Crops Research, 120, 2, pp. 205-214, (2011); Nishiuchi, Shunsaku, Mechanisms for coping with submergence andwaterlogging in rice, Rice, 5, 1, pp. 1-14, (2012); Suralta, Roel Rodriguez, Dry matter production in relation to root plastic development, oxygen transport, and water uptake of rice under transient soil moisture stresses, Plant and Soil, 332, 1, pp. 87-104, (2010); Niones, Jonathan Manito, Field evaluation on functional roles of root plastic responses on dry matter production and grain yield of rice under cycles of transient soil moisture stresses using chromosome segment substitution lines, Plant and Soil, 359, 1-2, pp. 107-120, (2012); Boling, Anita A., Yield constraints of rainfed lowland rice in Central Java, Indonesia, Field Crops Research, 90, 2-3, pp. 351-360, (2004); Boling, Anita A., Modelling the effect of groundwater depth on yield-increasing interventions in rainfed lowland rice in Central Java, Indonesia, Agricultural Systems, 92, 1-3, pp. 115-139, (2007); McDonald, Andrew James, Water balance and rice growth responses to direct seeding, deep tillage, and landscape placement: Findings from a valley terrace in Nepal, Field Crops Research, 95, 2-3, pp. 367-382, (2006); Agric Sci, (2013); O'Toole, John C., Genotypic variation in crop plant root systems, Advances in Agronomy, 41, C, pp. 91-145, (1987); Sandhu, Nitika, Rice root architectural plasticity traits and genetic regions for adaptability to variable cultivation and stress conditions, Plant Physiology, 171, 4, pp. 2562-2576, (2016)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","29531273","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044142134"

In this study, we considered mental workload from a secondary task as a potential source of cognitive distraction and aimed to estimate the increased cognitive load on the driver with a four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device by introducing a machine-learning method for hemodynamic data. To produce added cognitive workload in a driver beyond just driving, two levels of an auditory presentation n-back task were used. A total of 60 experimental data sets from the NIRS device during two driving tasks were obtained and analyzed by machine-learning algorithms. We used two techniques to prevent overfitting of the classification models: (1) k-fold cross-validation and principal-component analysis, and (2) retaining 25% of the data (testing data) for testing of the model after classification. Six types of classifier were trained and tested: decision tree, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, the support vector machine, the nearest neighbor classifier, and the ensemble classifier. Cognitive workload levels were well classified from the NIRS data in the cases of subject-dependent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 81.30 to 95.40%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data was 82.18 to 96.08%), subject 26 independent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 84.90 to 89.50%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data increased from 84.08 to 89.91%), and channel-independent classification (classification 82.90%, prediction 82.74%). NIRS data in conjunction with an artificial intelligence method can therefore be used to classify mental workload as a source of potential cognitive distraction in real time under naturalistic conditions; this information may be utilized in driver assistance systems to prevent road accidents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Classification; Cognitive distraction; Driver attention; Mental workload; Near-infrared spectroscopy","article; artificial intelligence; attention; decision tree; discriminant analysis; driver; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; n-back test; near infrared spectroscopy; prediction; principal component analysis; support vector machine; traffic accident; validation process; workload","","","This study was partially supported by DENSO CORPORATION and by the Center of Innovation Program (Nagoya University COI: Mobility Innovation Center) from Japan Science and Technology Agency.","Abdelnour, Farras, Real-time imaging of human brain function by near-infrared spectroscopy using an adaptive general linear model, NeuroImage, 46, 1, pp. 133-143, (2009); Aghajani, Haleh, Measuring mental workload with EEG+fNIRS, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 11, (2017); Driver Workload Metrics Task 2 Final Report, (2006); Identification of Cognitive Load in Naturalistic Driving, (2015); J Transp Technol, (2017); Le, Anh Son, Effect of mental workload and aging on driver distraction based on the involuntary eye movement, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 484, pp. 349-359, (2017); Futur Act Saf Technol Towar Zero Traffic Accid Conf, (2017); Le, Anh Son, Towards online detection of driver distraction: Eye-movement simulation based on a combination of vestibulo–ocular reflex and optokinetic reflex models, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 65, pp. 716-729, (2019); Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference University Village, (2016); Proceedings of the 2017 Japan Society Automotive Engineers Annual Congress, (2017)","","Frontiers Media S.A. info@frontiersin.org","","","","","","16625161","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056851514"

The sensor is backside-illuminated. Each pixel is equipped with multiple collection gates (MCG) at the center of the front side. Each collection gate is connected to an in-pixel large memory unit, which can accumulate image signals captured by repetitive imaging. The combination of the backside illumination, image signal accumulation, and slow readout from the in-pixel signal storage after an image capturing operation offers a very high sensitivity. Pipeline signal transfer from the the multiple collection gates (MCG) to the in-pixel memory units enables the sensor to achieve a large frame count and a very high frame rate at the same time. A test sensor was fabricated with a pixel count of 32 × 32 pixels. Each pixel is equipped with four collection gates, each connected to a memory unit with 305 elements; thus, with a total frame count of 1220 (305 × 4) frames.

However, the understanding of inter-host viral determinants that drive DENV replication and growth between hosts is limited. Through the use of clinical isolates, we identified an amino acid variation of Ala, Met and Val at position 116 of DENV-1 NS4B. While the proportion of virus with the NS4B-116V variant remained constantly high in serial passages in a mosquito cell line, populations of the NS4B-116M and NS4B-116A variants became dominant after serial passages in mammalian cell lines. Using recombinant DENV-1 viruses, the Val to Ala or Met alteration at position NS4B-116 (rDENV-1-NS4B-116A and rDENV-1-NS4B-116M) resulted in enhanced virus growth in human cells in comparison to the clone with Val at NS4B-116 (rDENV-1-NS4B-116V). However, the reverse phenomenon was observed in a mosquito cell line. Additionally, in a human cell line, differential levels of IFN-a/b and IFN-stimulated gene expressions (IFIT3, IFI44L, OAS1) suggested that the enhanced viral growth was dependent on the ability of the NS4B protein to hamper host IFN response during the early phase of infection. Overall, we identified a novel and critical viral determinant at the pTMD3 of NS4B region that displayed differential effects on DENV replication and fitness in human and mosquito cell lines. Taken together, the results suggest the importance of the NS4B protein in virus replication and adaptation between hosts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dengue virus; NS4B; Variants","alpha interferon; beta interferon; interferon; nonstructural protein 4B; viral protein; amino acid substitution; animal cell; Article; controlled study; cytokine response; dendritic cell; Dengue virus; human; human cell; in vitro study; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; priority journal; Sanger sequencing; site directed mutagenesis; Vero cell line; virogenesis; virus cell interaction; virus culture; virus isolation; virus replication; Aedes; animal; Chlorocebus aethiops; genetic variation; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; metabolism; physiology; Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; Cercopithecus aethiops; Dengue Virus; Genetic Variation; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Interferons; Vero Cells; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Virus Replication","","Interferons; Viral Nonstructural Proteins","This work was supported by grants from the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (JGRID) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) (Grant number JP18FM0108001), e-Asia Joint Research Program (e-Asia JRP), and Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases of the Agency for Research and Development (AMED).

A test chip of the BSI MCG image sensor achieves the temporal resolution of 10 ns. The authors have derived the expression of the temporal resolution limit of photoelectron conversion layers. For silicon image sensors, the limit is 11.1 ps. By considering the theoretical derivation, a high-speed image sensor designed can achieve the frame rate close to the theoretical limit. However, some of the conditions conflict with performance indices other than the frame rate, such as sensitivity and crosstalk. After adjusting these trade-offs, a simple pixel model of the image sensor is designed and evaluated by simulations. The results reveal that the sensor can achieve a temporal resolution of 50 ps with the existing technology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Backside-illuminated; BSI; High-speed; Image sensor; MCG; Multi-collection-gate","Economic and social effects; Backside-illuminated; Fundamental structures; High Speed; High-speed image sensors; Multi-collection-gate; Performance indices; Photoelectron conversion; Theoretical derivations; Image sensors","","","Funding text 1: The sensor can be applied not only to ultra-high-speed imaging, such as imaging of fast cruck propagation and blasting, but also to innovation of advanced analyses and measurement technologies requiring ultra-high-speed image sensors, such as FLIM, imaging TOF-MS, and LIDAR. requiring ultra-high-speed image sensors, such as FLIM, imaging TOF-MS, and LIDAR.

In Experiment 1, we determined that Pig-fertilization medium was superior medium to Tyrode's albumin lactate pyruvate-polyvinyl alcohol medium for IVF and defined the optimum the sperm concentration (1 × 106 sperm/ml). In Experiment 2, we clarified that partial removal of cumulus cells from cumulus-oocyte complexes by hyaluronidase treatment before IVF enhances sperm penetration, whereas complete cumulus removal reduces penetration. Finally, in Experiment 3 the elevation of concentration of caffeine in Pig-fertilization medium from 2 to 5 mmol/L and the prolongation of the co-culture of gametes from 3 to 5 hr significantly increased the total penetration rate from 15.2% to over 50%.

Although this technique is practical and effective, embryonic damage caused by electroporation treatment remains a major problem. This study was conducted to evaluate the optimal culture system for electroporation-treated porcine embryos by supplementation of chlorogenic acid (CGA), a potent antioxidant, during in vitro oocyte maturation. The oocytes were treated with various concentrations of CGA (0, 10, 50, and 100 μmol/L) through the duration of maturation for 44 hr. The treated oocytes were then fertilized, electroporated at 30 V/mm with five 1 msec unipolar pulses, and subsequently cultured in vitro until development into the blastocyst stage. Without electroporation, the treatment with 50 μmol/L CGA had useful effects on the maturation rate of oocytes, the total cell number, and the apoptotic nucleus indices of blastocysts. When the oocytes were electroporated after in vitro fertilization, the treatment with 50 μmol/L CGA supplementation significantly improved the rate of oocytes that developed into blastocysts and reduced the apoptotic nucleus indices (4.7% and 7.6, respectively) compared with those of the untreated group (1.4% and 13.0, respectively). These results suggested that supplementation with 50 μmol/L CGA during maturation improves porcine embryonic development and quality of electroporation-treated embryos. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","antioxidant; chlorogenic acid; electroporation; embryo; oxidative stress","chlorogenic acid; animal; apoptosis; blastocyst; cell culture; cell culture technique; chemical stimulation; dose response; drug effect; electroporation; embryo development; growth, development and aging; in vitro fertilization; in vitro oocyte maturation; mammalian embryo; oocyte; pig; procedures; veterinary medicine; Animals; Apoptosis; Blastocyst; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells, Cultured; Chlorogenic Acid; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electroporation; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryonic Development; Fertilization in Vitro; In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques; Oocytes; Stimulation, Chemical; Swine","","chlorogenic acid, 327-97-9; Chlorogenic Acid","The authors would like to thank Nippon Food Packer, K.

Under such condition, root plasticity is one of the key traits that play important roles for plant adaptation. This study aimed to evaluate root plasticity expression and its functional roles in water uptake, dry matter production and yield under SMF using three chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) with major genetic background of KDML105 and a common substituted segment in chromosome 8. The CSSLs showed greater shoot dry matter production than KDML105 under SMF, which was attributed to the maintenance of stomatal conductance resulting in higher grain yield. The root system development based on total root length of the CSSLs were significantly higher than that of KDML105 due to the promoted production of nodal and lateral roots. These results implied that the common substituted segments in chromosome 8 of the 3 CSSLs may be responsible for the expression of their root plasticity under SMF and contributed to the increase in water uptake and consequently dry matter production and yield. These CSSLs could be used as a good source of genetic material for drought resistance breeding programs targeting rainfed lowland condition with fluctuating soil moisture environments and for further genetic studies to elucidate mechanisms underlying root plasticity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL); rainfed lowland (RFL); rice; root plasticity","","","","This research was funded by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 15H02644) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).

The model is based on the circuit modeling of the resonant tunneling diode and the passive structures. We investigate important system parameters such as the reflectivities at the transmitter and the receiver and the power coupling. It is found that the frequency change, the frequency change rate, and the direct-current change are mainly dependent on the reflectivity at the receiver. The received power change is mainly caused by the reflectivity at the transmitter. The simulations agree well with the experimental results. In addition, we demonstrate the high accuracy of our models by clarifying origins of the bit-error-rate change with distance. This demonstrates that the proposed model can be used for the design of a stable THz proximity wireless communication system. The model is also considered to be potentially applicable in other promising THz applications including sensing and radar. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","External feedback; radar; resonant tunneling diode (RTD); sensing; terahertz (THz); wireless communication","Bit error rate; Diodes; Feedback; Radar; Reflection; Resonant tunneling; Transmitters; Tunnel diode oscillators; Wireless telecommunication systems; Passive structures; Resonant tunneling diode oscillators; sensing; Tera Hertz; Transmitter and receiver; Wireless communication system; Wireless communications; Wireless transmissions; Resonant tunneling diodes","","","Manuscript received January 1, 2018; revised April 25, 2018; accepted May 17, 2018.

We have found that an upright NO adsorbed at a short-bridge site and a side-on NO at a hollow site connecting two short-bridge sites are the two most stable molecularly adsorbed states, and the latter is the precursor for the dissociation process. Various NO dissociation pathways under the influences of the hydrogen bonds with water have been investigated. We have found that hydrogen bonds efficiently reduce the activation energy of NO dissociation by the introductions of a water dimer to O and water dimers to both sides of the side-on NO, respectively. More importantly, the promoting effect of water molecules on NO dissociation is dominant only when one of water molecules in a water dimer forms a hydrogen bond with O of the side-on NO. Our results provide a physical insight into the promoting effect of hydrogen bonds with water, which may be helpful in improving the catalytic activity as well as designing novel catalysts for NO reduction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Activation energy; Catalyst activity; Copper compounds; Density functional theory; Dimers; Dissociation; Molecules; Nitric oxide; Adsorbed state; Dissociation process; NO dissociation; Novel catalysts; Oxide dissociation; Promoting effect; Short bridges; Water molecule; Hydrogen bonds","","","We thank Professors Hiroshi Okuyama and Akitoshi Shiotari for valuable discussions.

A mechanism to enhance plant gas exchange under water comprises gas films on hydrophobic leaves, but the genetic regulation of this mechanism is unknown. We used a rice mutant (dripping wet leaf 7, drp7) which does not retain gas films on leaves, and its wild-type (Kinmaze), in gene discovery for this trait. Gene complementation was tested in transgenic lines. Functional properties of leaves as related to gas film retention and underwater photosynthesis were evaluated. Leaf Gas Film 1 (LGF1) was identified as the gene determining leaf gas films. LGF1 regulates C30 primary alcohol synthesis, which is necessary for abundant epicuticular wax platelets, leaf hydrophobicity and gas films on submerged leaves. This trait enhanced underwater photosynthesis 8.2-fold and contributes to submergence tolerance. Gene function was verified by a complementation test of LGF1 expressed in the drp7 mutant background, which restored C30 primary alcohol synthesis, wax platelet abundance, leaf hydrophobicity, gas film retention, and underwater photosynthesis. The discovery of LGF1 provides an opportunity to better understand variation amongst rice genotypes for gas film retention ability and to target various alleles in breeding for improved submergence tolerance for yield stability in flood-prone areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","air film; epicuticular waxes; Oryza sativa; primary alcohol; submergence tolerance; superhydrophobic; underwater photosynthesis; wax biosynthesis","alcohol; allele; breeding; film; flood; gas exchange; gene; hydrophobicity; leaf; photosynthesis; submergence; Oryza sativa; plant protein; wax; adaptation; biosynthesis; chemical phenomena; flooding; gas; genetic complementation; genetics; metabolism; mutation; nucleotide sequence; Oryza; physiology; plant epidermis; plant gene; plant leaf; Adaptation, Physiological; Base Sequence; Biosynthetic Pathways; Floods; Gases; Genes, Plant; Genetic Complementation Test; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Mutation; Photosynthesis; Plant Epidermis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Waxes","GENBANK: LC363889, LC363890","wax, 83062-05-9; Gases; Plant Proteins; Waxes","We thank Dr Toshihiro Kumamaru from the Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, for providing seeds of Kinmaze and the drp7 mutant.

Such soil moisture fluctuation (SMF) which is completely different from simple or progressive drought could be stressful for plant growth, thereby causing reduction in yield. Root plasticity is one of the key traits that play important roles for plant adaptation under such conditions. This study aimed to evaluate root plasticity expression and its functional roles in dry matter production and yield under SMF using Nipponbare, KDML 105 and three backcross inbred lines (BILs) and to identify QTL(s) associated with root traits in response to SMF at two growth stages using Nipponbare/KDML105 F<inf>2</inf> plants. A BIL, G3-3 showed higher shoot dry matter production and yield than Nipponbare due to its greater ability to maintain stomatal conductance concomitant with greater root system development caused by promoted production of nodal and lateral roots under SMF. QTLs were identified for total nodal root length, total lateral root length, total root length, number of nodal roots, and branching index under SMF at vegetative and reproductive stages. The QTLs detected at vegetative and reproductive stages were different. We discuss here that relationship between root system of G3-3 and the detected QTLs. Therefore, G3-3 and the identified QTLs could be useful genetic materials in breeding program for improving the adaptation of rice plants in target rainfed lowland areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","QTL; rainfed lowland; rice; root plasticity","","","","This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research [grant number 15H02644] from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).","Int J Agric Crop Sci, (2011); Azhiri-Sigari, T., Genotypic variation in response of rainfed lowland rice to drought and rewatering: II.

OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the effects of antifreeze protein (AFP) supplementation on the quality and development of in vitro-produced porcine morulae after short-term storage (24 h). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The morulae were stored with various concentrations of AFP type III for 24 h at 5, 15 and 25 C. RESULTS: Supplementation of AFP type III (1.0 µg/ml) improved the developmental competence of embryos stored at 25°C. The proportions of DNA-fragmented nuclei in the blastocysts did not differ between the embryos stored at 25°C and the control embryos without storage treatment. However, the developmental competence of embryos stored at hypothermic temperatures decreased relative to that of the control embryos. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of AFP type III (1.0 µg/ml) maintained the quality of embryos stored at 25°C, but did not have beneficial effects on the development of embryos stored at hypothermic temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antifreeze proteins; Chilling; Embryo; Porcine; Quality","antifreeze protein; cryoprotective agent; animal; blastocyst; cryopreservation; DNA fragmentation; drug effect; female; pig; procedures; Animals; Antifreeze Proteins; Blastocyst; Cryopreservation; Cryoprotective Agents; DNA Fragmentation; Female; Swine","","Antifreeze Proteins; Cryoprotective Agents","In conclusion, we confirmed that the storage of in vitro-produced porcine embryos at lows temperature of 25°C or less for 24 h affects their subsequent in-vitro development and quality.

However, there have been no hyperspectral imagers that cover the entire Earth surface. This lack points to a need for producing pseudo-hyperspectral imagery by hyperspectral transformation from multispectral images. We have recently developed such a method, a Pseudo-Hyperspectral Image Transformation Algorithm (PHITA), which transforms Landsat 7 ETM+ images into pseudo-EO-1 Hyperion images using multiple linear regression models of ETM+ and Hyperion band reflectance data. This study extends the PHITA to transform TM, OLI, and EO-1 ALI sensor images into pseudo-Hyperion images. By choosing a part of the Fish Lake Valley geothermal prospect area in the western United States for study, the pseudo-Hyperion images produced from the TM, ETM+, OLI, and ALI images by PHITA were confirmed to be applicable to mineral mapping. Using a reference map as the truth, three main minerals (muscovite and chlorite mixture, opal, and calcite) were identified with high overall accuracies from the pseudo-images (>95% and >42% for excluding and including unclassified pixels, respectively). The highest accuracy was obtained from the ALI image, followed by ETM+, TM, and OLI images in descending order. The TM, OLI, and ALI images can be alternatives to ETM+ imagery for the hyperspectral transformation that aids the production of pseudo-Hyperion images for areas without high-quality ETM+ images because of scan line corrector failure, and for long-term global monitoring of land surfaces. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hydrothermal alteration minerals; Hyperion image; Hyperspectral transformation; Mineral mapping; Multiple linear regression model; Reflectance spectrum","Clay alteration; Linear regression; Linear transformations; Mapping; Metadata; Mica; Minerals; Reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Hydrothermal alteration minerals; Hyperion; HyperSpectral; Mineral mapping; Multiple linear regression models; Reflectance spectrum; Mathematical transformations; accuracy assessment; algorithm; comparative study; geological mapping; geothermal system; hydrothermal alteration; image analysis; Landsat thematic mapper; mineral; numerical model; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; spectrum; Canada; Devon Island; Fish Lake; Nunavut; Queen Elizabeth Islands; United States","","","The authors express their gratitude to USGS and NASA for providing raw EO-1 Hyperion, ALI, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI images, and to Drs.

In this report, we assayed the virulence and pathogenicity of MoCV1-A-infected and MoCV1-A-free M. oryzae on rice plants. MoCV1-A infection did not affect virulence-associated fungal traits, such as conidial germination and appressorium formation. However, after punch inoculation of leaves on rice plants, MoCV1-A-infected strain formed smaller lesions than the MoCV1-A-free strain did on all rice varieties tested, showing that MoCV1-A infection resulted in reduced virulence of host fungi in rice plants. In contrast, after spray inoculation of rice seedlings, in some cases, MoCV1-A-infected and MoCV1-A-free strains caused different lesion types (resistance to susceptible, or vice versa) on individual international differential rice varieties. However, we did not find any gain/loss of the fungal avirulence genes by PCR, suggesting that MoCV1-A infection can convert the pathogenicity of the host M. oryzae from avirulence to virulence, or from virulence to avirulence, depending on the rice variety. We also confirmed the correlation of these race conversion events and invasive hyphae growth of the fungi in a leaf sheath inoculation assay. These data suggested that MoCV1-A infection generally confers hypovirulence to the fungal host and could be a driving force to generate physiological diversity, including pathogenic races. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Magnaporthe oryzae; Magnaporthe oryzae chrysovirus 1; Mycovirus; Pathogenicity; Race; Virulence","","","","Acknowledgements This research was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Linking Mechanism of Research Results to Practical Application from Japan Science and Technology Agency (No. 859100012), by a grant from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (No. 08C46503c) to H.M. and by JSPS KAKENHI grants (No. 11J07853, 24658039, and 26660033) to S.U., T.A., and T.T., respectively.","Ai, Yeping, A novel single-stranded RNA virus isolated from the rice-pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae with similarity to members of the family Tombusviridae, Archives of Virology, 161, 3, pp. 725-729, (2016); Aoki, Nanako, A novel mycovirus associated with four double-stranded RNAs affects host fungal growth in Alternaria alternata, Virus Research, 140, 1-2, pp. 179-187, (2009); Bonman, J.

We also investigated the genetic diversity of norovirus GI and GII in oyster and wastewater samples by using pyrosequencing to evaluate the effect of urban drainage on norovirus contamination of oysters. A total of 34 oyster samples were collected at two sampling sites (stations A and B) in a lagoon. Norovirus GI was more frequently detected than GII (positive rate 79 vs. 41%). Maximum concentrations of GI and GII were 2.4 × 105 and 2.3 × 104 copies/g, respectively. Co-contamination with GI and GII was observed in 35% of samples. Norovirus GII concentration was higher at station A in the flood season than in the dry season (P = 0.04, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

Antibodies target DENV by two pathologic mechanisms: virus neutralization and infection enhancement. In dengue patients, the absence of neutralizing activity in the presence of FcγR implies that infection-enhancing activity hampers the neutralizing activity of antibodies, which could potentially lead to symptomatic presentations and severe clinical outcomes. Methods: A total of 100 pair serum samples from adult healthy volunteers were obtained during the dengue season in Ha Noi in 2015 for evaluation of neutralizing and infection-enhancing activity. Additionally, 20 serum samples from acute secondary DENV infection patients were also used as the patient group in this study. PRNT was performed on BHK cells and FcγR-expressing BHK cell lines for all serum samples. Results: Out of 100 residents, positive neutralizing antibodies (N.A) were found in 44.23 and 76.92% for DENV-1; 38.46 and 75% for DENV-2; 19.23 and 15.38% for DENV-3; and 1.92 and 9.62% for DENV-4 for pre and post-dengue season respectively. The percentage of post-exposure residents having positive responses against single, two, or more than three DENV serotypes were 38.46, 44.23 and 15.38%, respectively. A total of 34 residents were DENV seropositive before the dengue season and these individuals demonstrated further elevation of IgG antibodies after the dengue season. At the end of the season, 18 residents were confirmed to be new asymptomatic DENV infection cases. In both groups, N.A titers determined on BHK cells were higher than that on FcγR-expressing BHK cells. In heterotypic N.A responses, N.A titers to the infecting serotype from the samples obtained from pre-exposure group were significantly higher than those of the patient group. However, fold enhancement to the infecting serotypes from the samples in the pre-exposure group was substantially lower as compared to that of the patient group. Conclusion: Before and after the dengue season, serum samples from healthy volunteers demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies and low or absence of infection-enhancement activity. The results suggest that while infection-enhancement activity hampers neutralizing activity of antibodies, high levels of DENV neutralizing antibodies set a critical threshold in facilitating the prevention of disease progression. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dengue virus (DENV); Dengue virus neutralizing antibody; Monotypic, heterotypic immune response; Primary DENV infection; Secondary DENV infection","Fc receptor; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; neutralizing antibody; immunoglobulin M; adult; animal cell; antibody blood level; antibody response; antibody titer; Article; BHK cell line; clinical article; controlled study; dengue; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; Dengue virus 3; Dengue virus 4; female; human; male; nonhuman; protein expression; Viet Nam; animal; blood; cell line; Dengue virus; hamster; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; mixed infection; normal human; pathogenicity; season; serotype; virology; Adult; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Cell Line; Coinfection; Cricetinae; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Middle Aged; Receptors, IgG; Seasons; Serogroup","","immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Immunoglobulin M; Receptors, IgG","This work was supported by grants from the e-Asia Joint Research Program (e-Asia JRP) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (JGRID) and, the Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and development (AMED); and MSD Life Science Foundation International.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder and affects 1% of the population over 60 years of age. A complex combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to the pathogenesis of PD. However, since the onset mechanisms of PD have not yet been elucidated in detail, difficulties are associated with developing effective treatments. Curcumin has been reported to have neuroprotective properties in PD models induced by neurotoxins or genetic factors such as α-synuclein, PINK1, DJ-1, and LRRK2. In the present study, we investigated the effects of curcumin in a novel Drosophila model of PD with knockdown of dUCH, a homolog of human UCH-L1. We found that dopaminergic neuron-specific knockdown of dUCH caused impaired movement and the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the knockdown of dUCH induced oxidative stress while curcumin decreased the ROS level induced by this knockdown.

Taken together, with studies on other PD models, these results strongly suggest that treatments with curcumin are an appropriate therapy for PD related to oxidative stress. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Neurons; Oxidative stress; Disease progression; Dopaminergic neurons; Drosophila melanogaster; Environmental factors; Genetic factors; Neurodegeneration; Neurodegenerative disorders; Parkinson's disease; Neurodegenerative diseases; curcumin; neurotransmitter; reactive oxygen metabolite; ubiquitin thiolesterase; neuroprotective agent; adult; animal tissue; Article; comparative study; controlled study; dopaminergic nerve cell; drug effect; food intake; gene knockdown; high performance liquid chromatography; in vivo study; larval stage; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Parkinson disease; phenotype; animal; animal behavior; deficiency; Drosophila; genetics; male; metabolism; Age; Antioxidants; Diseases; Models; Phenotypes; Stresses; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Curcumin; Male; Neuroprotective Agents; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Reactive Oxygen Species; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","","curcumin, 458-37-7; ubiquitin thiolesterase, 86480-67-3; Curcumin; Neuroprotective Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","This work was supported by the National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam [106-YS.06-2014.14] and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Adaptable and Seamless Technology Transfer Program through Target-Driven R and D (A-STEP), Japan [AS262Z008969]; and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Core-to-Core Program, Asia-Africa Science Platforms, Japan.

In this paper, a two-step co-solvent method for BDF production from CNO was examined. Firstly, esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) (7 wt%) present in CNO was carried out using a co-solvent of acetonitrile (30 wt%) and H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> as a catalyst. The content of FFAs was reduced to 0.8 wt% in 1 h at 65℃. Subsequent transesterification of the crude oil produced was carried out using a co-solvent of acetone (20 wt%) and 1 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH). Ester content of 99.3% was obtained at 40℃ in 45 min. The water content in BDF was 0.023% upon purification using vacuum distillation at 5 kPa. The components of CNO BDF were characterized using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector. The physicochemical properties of BDF satisfied the ASTM D6751-02 standard. The gaseous exhaust emissions from the diesel engine upon combustion of the BDF blends (B0–B100) with petrodiesel were examined. The emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were clearly lower, but that of nitrogen oxides was higher in comparison to those from petro-diesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiesel; Candlenut oil; Co-solvent technology; Exhaust gases; Transesterification","Acetone; Biodiesel; Carbon monoxide; Crude oil; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Distillation; Esters; Exhaust gases; Fatty acids; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Ionization of gases; Nitrogen oxides; Potassium hydroxide; Transesterification; Candlenut oil; Cosolvents; Esterification of free fatty acids; Exhaust emission; Fourier transform infrared spectrometry; Gas chromatography-flame ionization detectors; Physicochemical property; Vacuum distillation; Organic solvents; acetone; biofuel; carbon monoxide; fatty acid; hydrocarbon; hydroxide; nitrogen oxide; potassium derivative; potassium hydroxide; solvent; sulfuric acid; vegetable oil; water; Aleurites; catalysis; chemical phenomena; chemistry; esterification; flame ionization detection; gas; infrared spectroscopy; temperature; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Catalysis; Chemical Phenomena; Esterification; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Flame Ionization; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydroxides; Nitrogen Oxides; Plant Oils; Potassium Compounds; Solvents; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Sulfuric Acids; Temperature; Water","","acetone, 67-64-1; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; hydroxide, 14280-30-9; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; potassium hydroxide, 1310-58-3; sulfuric acid, 7664-93-9; water, 7732-18-5; Acetone; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydroxides; Nitrogen Oxides; Plant Oils; Potassium Compounds; potassium hydroxide; Solvents; sulfuric acid; Sulfuric Acids; Water","This study was supported by Vietnam Counterpart finance of the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Project(SATREPS Project): “Multi-beneficial Measures for Mitigation of Climate Change in Vietnam and Indochina Countries by Development of Biomass Energy, JST-JICA”.","Ramanathan, Veerabhadran, Trace-gas greenhouse effect and global warming: Underlying Principles and Outstanding Issues Volvo Environmental Prize Lecture-1997, Ambio, 27, 3, pp. 187-197, (1998); J Kones Powertrain Transp; Wong, Yee Ching, Biodiesel production from used cooking oil, Oriental Journal of Chemistry, 30, 2, pp. 521-528, (2014); Ramadhas, Arumugam Sakunthalai, Biodiesel production from high FFA rubber seed oil, Fuel, 84, 4, pp. 335-340, (2005); Proc World Congr Eng Comput Sci; Maeda, Yasuaki, New technology for the production of biodiesel fuel, Green Chemistry, 13, 5, pp. 1124-1128, (2011); Luu, Phuongduc Duc, Co-solvent method produce biodiesel form waste cooking oil with small pilot plant, Energy Procedia, 61, pp. 2822-2832, (2014); Ejikeme, Paul Madus, Catalysis in biodiesel production by transesterification processes-an insight, E-Journal of Chemistry, 7, 4, pp. 1120-1132, (2010); Thanh, Letu, Catalytic technologies for biodiesel fuel production and utilization of glycerol: A review, Catalysts, 2, 1, pp. 191-222, (2012); World Acad Sci Eng Technol, (2008)","","Japan Oil Chemists Society yukagaku@jocs-office.or.jp","","","","","","13473352; 13458957","","","29628489","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046412993"

In order to reduce environmental pollution, utilization of digested slurry as a fertilizer in paddy fields is one promising measure. NH<inf>3</inf> in the digested slurry is easily volatilized after application. Therefore, NH<inf>3</inf> volatilization is a key factor for fertilizer design. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to examine the characteristics and mechanism of NH<inf>3</inf> volatilization from Vietnamese paddy soil (acid sulfate soil) following application of digested slurry with the overall goal of evaluating digested slurry as a fertilizer. Incubation experiments under flooded conditions were conducted with Vietnamese acid sulfate soil and Japanese soil. Six fertilizer treatments were carried out, namely Vietnamese soil with no fertilizer, Vietnamese soil with urea, Vietnamese soil with digested slurry, Vietnamese soil with half the amount of digested slurry, Japanese soil with no fertilizer, and Japanese soil with digested slurry. pH, NHx–N, and SO<inf>4</inf> 2− in the floodwater and NH<inf>3</inf> volatilization fluxes were measured for 1 week after application of digested slurry or urea. The results indicated that the amount of NH<inf>3</inf> volatilization in Vietnamese soil is small compared to Japanese soil because the pH of floodwater from Vietnamese soil remains low (3.7–7.6) due to oxidation of pyrite, and this low pH inhibits NH<inf>3</inf> volatilization. Therefore, we conclude that NH<inf>X</inf>–N in digested slurry can be efficiently utilized as a fertilizer in Vietnamese paddy fields with acid sulfate soils. Moreover, the results also indicate that relatively more NH<inf>3</inf> is volatilized even in Vietnamese soil by the slowdown in pyrite oxidation and the buffering capacity of digested slurry when much digested slurry is applied. Therefore, NH<inf>3</inf> volatilization can be reduced using methods such as a split application to maintain low floodwater pH. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acid sulfate soil; Anaerobic digestion; Paddy soil; Rice; Vietnam","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Fertilizers; Floods; Metabolism; Pulp digesters; Pyrites; Sulfur compounds; Urea; Wastewater treatment; Acid sulfate soils; Ammonia volatilization; Characteristics and mechanisms; Environmental pollutions; Laboratory experiments; Paddy soils; Rice; Viet Nam; Soils; acid sulfate soil; agricultural soil; ammonia; anaerobic digestion; biogas; experimental study; oxidation; rice; slurry; urea","","","Acknowledgements This work was supported by JST/JICA SATREPS, ‘‘Sustainable Integration of Local Agriculture and Biomass Industries.’’ The soil of experimental field was imported to Japan under the approval from Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan based on the Plant Protection Act.

However, besides the sensitivity, a high selectivity is critically important to distinguish the true signal from interference signals in a non-controlled environment. This work presents the first demonstration of the successful integration of a novel peptide aptamer with a liquid-gated SWCNT FET to achieve highly sensitive and specific detection of Cathepsin E (CatE), a useful prognostic biomarker for cancer diagnosis. Novel peptide aptamers that specifically recognize CatE are engineered by systemic in vitro evolution. The SWCNTs were firstly grown using the thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and then were employed as a channel to fabricate a SWCNT FET device. Next, the SWCNTs were functionalized by noncovalent immobilization of the peptide aptamer using 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBASE) linker.

Those limitations require an innovative technique that can simulate hyperspectral imagery from multispectral imagery with global coverage, continuous acquisition, and a small number of bands. For this, a combination of Hyperion and Landsat 7 ETM+ images is a representative target. The present study develops a new method, Pseudo-Hyperspectral Image Transformation Algorithm (PHITA), for transforming Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery into pseudo-Hyperion imagery using correlations between Landsat and Hyperion band reflectance data. Each correlation is defined as a multiple linear regression model selected through Bayesian model averaging, in which Hyperion and Landsat bands are dependent and predictor variables, respectively. The resultant pseudo-image has a number of high-quality Hyperion bands of the same scene size as a Landsat image. Through verification of transformation accuracy by statistical analyses and surface mineral mapping, the pseudo-Hyperion image was proven very similar to the original band reflectances, because of large Pearson's correlation coefficients (generally > 0.94), small RMS error (mostly < 0.016), high structural similarity, and similar appearance of the color composite image. Using a reference mineral map built from an AVIRIS image and field surveys as ground truth, an advantage of the pseudo-image is clarified for the Cuprite hydrothermal alteration area in the western United States. The identification and mapping accuracies of metal deposit-related minerals were high even in areas outside the original Hyperion scene. Featured absorptions were reconstructed in pseudo-reflectance spectra of the typical minerals in the area. The results can enhance the potential of a large Landsat-series dataset over the long term by transformation into pseudo-Hyperion images for global land surfaces. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian model averaging; Cuprite; Hyperion image; Landsat ETM+ image; Multiple linear regression; Pseudo-band reflectance","Bayesian networks; Clay alteration; Correlation methods; Deposits; Linear regression; Mapping; Metadata; Mineral exploration; Minerals; Reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Bayesian model averaging; Cuprite; Hyperion; Landsat ETM+; Multiple linear regressions; Image enhancement; algorithm; AVIRIS; hydrothermal alteration; Landsat; mapping method; multiple regression; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spectral reflectance; Nevada; United States","","","The authors wish to express their gratitude to USGS and NASA for providing raw EO-1 Hyperion and Landsat 7 ETM+ images, and to Gregg A.

It suggests that these local extreme rainfall events are attributed to four clustered patterns, which are primarily related to the Baiu front and the extratropical/tropical cyclone/depression activities and represented by the intrusion of warm and moist air accompanied by the low-level jet or cyclonic circulation. The classification results are then implemented with the analogue method to predict the occurrence (yes/no) of local heavy rainfall days in June–July of 2011–2016 by using the prognostic synoptic fields from the operational Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Global Spectral Model (GSM). In general, the predictability of our approach evaluated by the Equitable Threat Score up to 7-day lead times is significantly improved than that from the conventional method using only the predicted rainfall intensity from GSM. Although the false alarm ratio is still high, it is expected that the new method will provide a useful guidance, particularly for ranges longer than 2 days, for decision-making and preparation by weather forecasters or end-users engaging in disaster-proofing and water management activities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Baiu; clustering; forecast; heavy rainfall; Kyushu; self-organizing map","artificial neural network; classification; extreme event; pattern recognition; rainfall; synoptic meteorology; weather forecasting; Japan; Kyushu","","","The authors greatly appreciate three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Although recent development of direct acting antiviral (DAA) compounds improved anti-HCV regimens, alternative therapeutic compounds are still demanded due to an expected emergence of escape mutants for those DAAs. In order to identify novel anti-HCV agents, we conducted chemical library screening for 2086 compounds using HCV Rep-Feo reporter replicon in Huh7 hepatoma cells. Our screening identified retinoid derivative Tp80, which inhibits replication of HCV Rep-Feo (genotype 1b) and JFH1 HCV (genotype 2a) with 0.62 μM and 1.0 μM, respectively, of 50% effective concentration (EC<inf>50</inf>), at which cytotoxicity is not evident for host hepatocytes. Subsequent transcriptome profiling revealed Tp80 exhibits anti-HCV activity through restoration of gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase (GI-GPx), suppression of which is responsible for HCV-induced oxidative stress to facilitate HCV replication. Furthermore, comparison of Tp80 with other retinoid derivatives revealed Tp80 shows best potency in both GI-GPx restoration and anti-HCV activity among compounds we examined. In conclusion, our current study provides Tp80 as a promising candidate of anti-HCV compound, suppressing host cellular oxidative stress through a restoration of GI-GPx. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","antiviral agents; hepatitis C virus; microarrays; research and analysis methods; virus classification","antivirus agent; gastrointestinal glutathione; glutathione; peroxidase; retinoid derivative; tp 80; transcriptome; unclassified drug; glutathione peroxidase; GPX2 protein, human; retinoid; antiviral activity; Article; cell stress; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug potency; drug screening; EC50; Hepatitis C virus; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2a; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; host cell; Huh7 cell line; human; human cell; liver cell; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein expression; replicon; virus inhibition; virus replication; cell line; chemistry; drug development; drug effects; gene expression profiling; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; high throughput screening; isolation and purification; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; molecular library; virology; Antiviral Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line; Drug Discovery; Gene Expression Profiling; Genotype; Glutathione Peroxidase; Hepatocytes; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Oxidative Stress; Retinoids; Small Molecule Libraries; Virus Replication","","glutathione, 70-18-8; peroxidase, 9003-99-0; glutathione peroxidase, 9013-66-5; Antiviral Agents; Glutathione Peroxidase; GPX2 protein, human; Retinoids; Small Molecule Libraries","We acknowledge Medical Research Support Center, Kyoto University for providing chemical library screening platform.

It was the largest disaster triggered by torrential rainfall in Vietnam in 2015. The immediate economic loss in Quang Ninh is estimated to be about VND 2000 billion (US$92 million). Seventeen people were reported dead, 1,459 households were evacuated and at least 30 houses were destroyed. Eight of the victims died when a landslide buried three houses at Cao Thang ward, Ha Long City. We undertook field investigation and ring-shear simulations to study the initiation mechanism and behaviour of the landslide. The rainfall-induced pore-water pressures were estimated using the Slope-Infiltration-Distributed Equilibrium (SLIDE) model developed by Sassa et al. (2010) and Liao et al. (2010, 2012). The ring-shear apparatus (ICL-1) was used to simulate the soil failure, formation of sliding surface and steady-state motion of the landslide. Landslide dynamic parameters obtained and estimated from ring-shear tests were used in the integrated simulation model LS-RAPID to simulate landslide motion. The results demonstrate that the LS-RAPID model predicts a similar hazard area to that observed in the field investigation. In addition, the time of landslide occurrence estimated from the rainfall record and the LS-RAPID simulation is close to the time of occurrence reported by local inhabitants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer simulation; Ha Long; Rainfall; Rapid landslide; SLIDE model; Undrained ring-shear test; Vietnam","Computer simulation; Landslides; Losses; Ha Long; Initiation mechanism; Integrated simulation models; Pore-water pressures; Ring shear tests; Steady-state motions; Torrential rainfalls; Viet Nam; Rain; computer simulation; debris flow; flooding; landslide; natural hazard; numerical model; rainfall; shear test; sliding; Quang Ninh","","","This research is a part of the Vietnamese-Japanese joint research SATREPS’ project “Development of landslide risk assessment technology along transportation arteries in Vietnam.” The project is financed by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

The present study evaluates the effect of the sedimentary environments of the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, and the recharge systems, on the groundwater arsenic pollution in Hanoi suburbs distant from the Red River. At two study sites (Linh Dam and Tai Mo communes), undisturbed soil cores identified a Pleistocene confined aquifer (PCA) and Holocene unconfined aquifer (HUA) as major aquifers, and Holocene estuarine and deltaic sediments as an aquitard layer between the two aquifers. The Holocene estuarine sediments (approximately 25–40 m depth, 9.6–4.8 cal ka BP) contained notably high concentrations of arsenic and organic matter, both likely to have been accumulated by mangroves during the Holocene sea-level highstand. The pore waters in these particular sediments exhibited elevated levels of arsenic and dissolved organic carbon. Arsenic in groundwater was higher in the PCA (25–94 μg/L) than in the HUA (5.2–42 μg/L), in both the monitoring wells and neighboring household tubewells. Elevated arsenic concentration in the PCA groundwater was likely due to vertical infiltration through the arsenic-rich and organic-matter-rich overlying Holocene estuarine sediments, caused by massive groundwater abstraction from the PCA. Countermeasures to prevent arsenic pollution of the PCA groundwater may include seeking alternative water resources, reducing water consumption, and/or appropriate choice of aquifers for groundwater supply. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arsenic; Health; Sediment pore water; Sedimentology; Vietnam","aquifer; arsenic; estuarine sediment; groundwater; Holocene; Pleistocene; pollutant source; porewater; sedimentology; suburban area; Hanoi; Viet Nam; Nes; Rhizophoraceae","","","The authors acknowledge the financial support by the CREST project grant for ‘Development of Well-balanced Urban Water Use System Adapted for Climate Change’ from the Japan Science and Technology Agency and JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) No. 26303013.

To resist strong attacks, we employ the robust feature extracted from the host image by using the combination of QR decomposition and 1D-DCT. Since the feature extracted from the host image presents the coarse part of the host image, we call it VMF. For enhancing the security of VMF, we apply the permutation method on VMF based on the Torus permutation to obtain PVMF. We construct a new method of image zero-watermarking by the encryption of VMF and PVMF with copyright data, and then generate the master share and the ownership share. The master share is generated by comparison of two consecutive DC coefficients after the QR decomposition is applied. The ownership share is generated by encryption of the master share with copyright data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against common processing and geometric attacks with low consuming time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1D-DCT; Image zero-watermarking; Permuted visual map feature (PVMF); QR decomposition; Visual map feature (VMF)","Algorithms; Copyrights; Cryptography; Digital watermarking; Image processing; Watermarking; 1D-DCT; Geometric attacks; Method of images; Original images; Q R decomposition; Visual map; Watermark information; Zero-watermarking; Image watermarking","","","This work is supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) No.24240001, a grant of I-System Co.

In order to evaluate the effect on groundwater recharge, of decreasing surface-water bodies and land-use change caused by urbanization, the relevant groundwater systems and recharge pathways must be characterized in detail. To this end, water levels and water quality were monitored for 3 years regarding groundwater and adjacent surface-water bodies, at two typical suburban sites in Hanoi. Stable isotope (δ18O, δD of water) analysis and hydrochemical analysis showed that the water from both aquifers and aquitards, including the groundwater obtained from both the monitoring wells and the neighboring household tubewells, was largely derived from evaporation-affected surface-water bodies (e.g., ponds, irrigated farmlands) rather than from rivers. The water-level monitoring results suggested distinct local-scale flow systems for both a Holocene unconfined aquifer (HUA) and Pleistocene confined aquifer (PCA). That is, in the case of the HUA, lateral recharge through the aquifer from neighboring ponds and/or irrigated farmlands appeared to be dominant, rather than recharge by vertical rainwater infiltration. In the case of the PCA, recharge by the above-lying HUA, through areas where the aquitard separating the two aquifers was relatively thin or nonexistent, was suggested. As the decrease in the local surface-water bodies will likely reduce the groundwater recharge, maintaining and enhancing this recharge (through preservation of the surface-water bodies) is considered as essential for the sustainable use of groundwater in the area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Groundwater recharge; Sediment pore water; Stable isotopes; Vietnam; Water level monitoring","groundwater; groundwater exploration; infiltration; land use change; porewater; recharge; stable isotope; suburban area; surface water; urbanization; water level; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","The authors acknowledge the financial support by the CREST project grant for ‘Development of Well-balanced Urban Water Use System Adapted for Climate Change’ from the Japan Science and Technology Agency and JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) 26303013.

Gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed that only the strain NVL3 degraded synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) into low-molecular-weight intermediates among the three strains found in the H2DA. The 16S-rRNA gene sequence of NVL3 showed the highest identity with that of Nocardia farcinica DSM 43665T. NVL3 accumulated aldehyde intermediates from synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) on a rubber-overlay plate as indicated by Schiff's staining. NVL3 also degraded deproteinized natural rubber into low-molecular-weight aldehyde intermediates. A latex-clearing protein (lcp) gene ortholog was identified within the genome sequence of NVL3, and it showed a moderate amino-acid identity (54–75%) with the lcp genes from previously reported rubber degraders. The heterologous expression of the NVL3 lcp in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) allowed us to purify the 46.8-kDa His-tagged lcp gene product (His-Lcp). His-Lcp degraded synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) and accumulated aldehyde intermediates from deproteinized natural rubber suggesting the functional expression of the lcp gene from a Nocardia degrader in E. coli. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis indicated the strong transcriptional induction of the lcp gene in NVL3 in the presence of synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene). These results suggest the involvement of the lcp gene in rubber degradation in NVL3. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Degradation; Functional expression; Latex-clearing protein; Nocardia; Rubber","Aldehydes; Degradation; Escherichia coli; Gel permeation chromatography; Gene expression; Latexes; Molecular weight; Proteins; RNA; Rubber; Synthetic rubber; Transcription; 16S rRNA gene sequence; Escherichia coli bl21; Functional expression; Heterologous expression; Natural rubber latex; Nocardia; Poly(cis-1 ,4-isoprene); Reverse transcription PCR; Genes; aldehyde; amino acid; isoprene; latex; poly(1,4 isoprene); ribosome RNA; RNA 16S; rubber; unclassified drug; 1,4-polyisoprene; hemiterpene; Article; controlled study; degradation; enrichment culture; gel permeation chromatography; gene; gene expression; gene induction; gene sequence; genetic transcription; heterologous expression; lcp gene; molecular weight; Nocardia farcinica; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rubber industry; Viet Nam; bacterial gene; chemistry; classification; genetics; industry; metabolism; Base Sequence; Genes, Bacterial; Hemiterpenes; Industry; Latex; Vietnam","GENBANK: KX064785, KX529888, KX529889, KX529890","amino acid, 65072-01-7; isoprene, 78-79-5; rubber, 9006-04-6; 1,4-polyisoprene; Aldehydes; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam and Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam.

Measurements were performed using a new online instrument. Two measurement periods were conducted during February 11–March 12, 2015 (cold period), and July 1–September 14, 2015 (warm period), at the urban site in Osaka, while 17 days of measurements, from May 21 to June 8, 2015, were conducted at the urban site in HCMC. The average NH<inf>3</inf> concentration at the HCMC site was much higher than that at the Osaka site. The differences in the NH<inf>3</inf> levels between the two cities are a result of their different emission sources. Traffic emission is a significant contributor to the NH<inf>3</inf> levels within the urban area in Osaka. Conversely, the contribution of traffic emission to the NH<inf>3</inf> levels in the HCMC urban area is negligible. With a population of around 8.5 million people living in the urban area of HCMC, the high NH<inf>3</inf> level is due to human sources and poor waste management systems, especially because of the high temperature (30 °C) and dense population of the city (density up to 42,000 inhabitants per km2). In contrast to the NH<inf>3</inf> levels, the highest PM<inf>2.5</inf>NH<inf>4</inf> + level occurred during the cold period at the Osaka site, and the average level at this site was higher than that at the HCMC site. The availability of atmospheric acids, low temperature, and high humidity facilitates the formation of ammonium. Our results indicate that NH<inf>3</inf> plays a key role in secondary inorganic aerosol formation; therefore, it contributes to a significant amount of PM<inf>2.5</inf> at the Osaka site.

Repeated nasal inoculation with the whole particle vaccine of an inactivated virus, A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/2007 (H5N1) (Vac-3), induced antigen-specific IgA and IgG antibody production in nasal swabs and plasma. Vac-3-specific IgE production was also found in the nasal swabs. Nasal vaccination with Vac-3 induced broader cross-clade neutralization activity than did subcutaneous vaccination. After challenge infection, repeated nasal vaccination almost completely prevented the propagation of virus in the upper and lower airways and protected cynomolgus macaques from viral pneumonia by induction of IgA-producing B cells in the lungs. On the other hand, eosinophil clusters were observed in the lungs of vaccinated macaques. Although Vac-3-specific IgE antibody and IL-13 levels were decreased after infection compared to those before infection and no anaphylaxis in vaccinated macaques was detected after challenge infection, our results suggest that we have to pay attention to potential allergic responses at repeated nasal vaccination, especially in people who have an airway allergy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eosinophil; H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus; IgE; Mucosal immunity; Nasal vaccination; Non-human primates","avian influenza vaccine; CD79a antigen; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; interleukin 13; interleukin 33; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; neutralizing antibody; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; inactivated vaccine; influenza vaccine; virus antibody; airway; anaphylaxis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody production; Article; avian influenza (H5N1); B lymphocyte; body temperature disorder; bronchus associated lymphoid tissue; cell infiltration; cladistics; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug megadose; eosinophil; female; immunogenicity; immunoglobulin blood level; immunoglobulin production; low drug dose; lymphocytic infiltration; lymphoid tissue; Macaca fascicularis; macrophage; nonhuman; nose smear; plasma cell; priority journal; repeated nasal vaccination; vaccination; virus inactivation; virus neutralization; virus particle; virus pneumonia; animal; biosynthesis; chemistry; drug effects; immunology; Influenza A virus (H5N1); intranasal drug administration; neutrophil chemotaxis; nose mucosa; orthomyxovirus infection; pathology; virion; virology; Administration, Intranasal; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Drug Hypersensitivity; Eosinophils; Female; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin E; Immunoglobulin G; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Nasal Mucosa; Neutrophil Infiltration; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Vaccination; Vaccines, Inactivated; Virion","","immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin E; Immunoglobulin G; Influenza Vaccines; Vaccines, Inactivated","We thank Masatoshi Okamatsu, Naoko Kitagawa, Hideaki Ishida, Takako Sasamura, Chikako Kinoshita and Shuji Sugiura for their assistance in the experiment, Hideaki Tsuchiya, Shinichiro Nakamura, Takahiro Nakagawa and Ikuo Kawamoto for animal care, and Toshihiro Ito and Mutsumi Ito for the arrangement of virus.

These compounds pose serious issues during the high-rate anaerobic digestion without pH adjustment and solid removal in advance. In this study, an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR, working volume of 68 L, ten compartments) was investigated for the treatment of such wastewater with a HRT of 3.5 ± 0.9 days. The performance of the ABR was evaluated with the stepwise increase in COD influent during a period 224 days. The microbial community in the sludge from each compartment of the ABR on the 143rd day was analyzed. Under an OLR of 1.4 ± 0.3 kg-COD/(m3·day), the highest COD and total suspended solid removal efficiency of 92.3 ± 6.3% and 90.0 ± 5.6%, respectively, were observed. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes using MiSeq revealed the difference acetogen communities in each compartment.

The main etiologic agent is Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV); however, there are also reports of Dengue virus (DENV) encephalitis. The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of patients with encephalitis due to JEV during the 2014 outbreak in Son La Province in Vietnam and to explore the association of DENV in non-JEV viral encephalitis cases. Of 90 patients, 6 (6.7%) were positive for anti-JEV immunoglobulin M (IgM), 5 (5.6%) were positive for anti-DENV IgM, 30 (33.3%) were positive for both anti-JEV and anti-DENV IgM, and 56 (62.2%) were positive for flavivirus immunoglobulin G (IgG). In 5 patients with AES, who had positive anti-DENV IgM results in at least one of the paired serum samples, DENV was confirmed by neutralization testing. The incidence of JEV infection was high. There is still a need to maintain and strengthen the national JEV immunization program. This noticeable occurrence of DENV infection was not reported in Son La Province in 2013–2014. Our data suggested that in addition to JEV, DENV was also a causative agent of AES in 2014 in Son La Province, and this finding also confirmed the local occurrence of DENV infection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acute encephalitis; Dengue; ELISA; Japanese encephalitis; Neutralization test","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; immunoglobulin M; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adult; Article; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; dengue; Dengue virus; disease association; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; fever; Glasgow coma scale; headache; human; immunization; infection; Japanese encephalitis; Japanese encephalitis virus; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; serodiagnosis; thrombocyte count; Viet Nam; virus encephalitis; adolescent; aged; blood; child; complication; immunology; incidence; infant; middle aged; preschool child; serology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Child; Child, Preschool; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Encephalitis Virus, Japanese; Encephalitis, Viral; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin M; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Neutralization Tests; Serologic Tests; Vietnam; Young Adult","","alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6; Antibodies, Viral; Immunoglobulin M","This work was funded by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI No. 24659210); Global Center of Excellence Program, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; e-Asia Joint Research Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan; Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases; Research on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, JST, Japan (H23-shinkou-ippan-010); and grant(s) in aid for scientific research by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.

The effects of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature on the photosynthesis of two Vietnamese brown algae, Sargassum mcclurei and S. oligocystum (Fucales), were determined by field and laboratory measurements. Dissolved oxygen sensors and pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry were used for the measurements of photosynthetic efficiency. A Diving-PAM revealed that underwater measurements of the effective quantum yield (Φ <inf>PSII</inf>) of both species declined with increasing incident PAR, with minimum Φ <inf>PSII</inf> occurring during noon to early afternoon. Φ <inf>PSII</inf> recovered in the evening, indicating photo-adaptation to excessive PAR. In laboratory experiments, Φ <inf>PSII</inf> also decreased under continuous exposure to 1000 μmol photons m−2 s−1; and full recovery occurred after 12 h of dark acclimatization. The net photosynthesis – PAR experiments of S. mcclurei and S. oligocystum conducted at 28°C revealed that the net photosynthetic rate quickly increased at PAR below the saturation irradiance of 361 and 301 μmol photons m−2 s−1 and nearly saturated to maximum net photosynthetic rates of 385 and 292 μg O<inf>2</inf> g<inf>ww</inf> − 1 min−1 without photoinhibition, respectively. Gross photosynthesis and dark respiration experiments determined over a range of temperatures (12–40°C), revealed that the maximum gross photosynthetic rates of 201 and 147 μg O<inf>2</inf> g<inf>ww</inf> − 1 min−1 occurred at 32.9 and 30.7°C for S. mcclurei and S. oligocystum, respectively. The dark respiration rates increased exponentially over the temperature ranges examined. The estimated maximum value of the maximum quantum yield occurred at 19.3 and 20.0°C and was 0.76 and 0.74, respectively. Similar to the natural habitat of the study site, these two species tolerated the relatively high temperatures and broad range of PAR. The ability of these species to recover from exposure to high PAR is one of the mechanisms that allow them to flourish in the shallow water environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","algae; diurnal change; Fucales; pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-chlorophyll fluorometry; Sargassaceae","brown alga; chlorophyll; diurnal variation; ecophysiology; field method; fluorometry; laboratory method; local adaptation; photosynthetically active radiation; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; algae; Fucales; Phaeophyceae; Sargassaceae; Sargassum; Sargassum mcclurei; Sargassum oligocystum","","","This research was supported in part by the CREST (#JAJJ110062) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (SK) and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (#25340012 and #25450260) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport and Technology (RT and GNN).

Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) produced from J. curcas seeds contains toxic phorbol esters that can cause cancer. The behaviors of toxic phorbol esters were investigated during BDF production. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and photodiode array analyses revealed that the phorbol esters contained in JCO had a tigliane skeleton. The partition coefficients of phorbol esters between methanol (MeOH) and the oil (K<inf>MeOH/oil</inf>) ranged from 2.4 to 20. As a result, the phorbol esters in the JCO were largely partitioned into the MeOH phase. The phorbol esters in the oil were converted stoichiometrically into phorbol and the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters via a transesterification reaction in a potassium hydroxide (KOH)/methanol (MeOH) solution. The phorbol produced predominantly partitioned into the glycerin phase. A small amount of phorbol residue contained in the BDF could be removed by washing with water. These results suggest that it is safe to use BDF produced by the aforementioned transesterification reaction and purification process.

Ozone is formed as a secondary pollutant via photochemical processes and is not emitted directly into the atmosphere. In this paper, the ozone increase resulting from the use of biodiesel and diesel fuels was investigated, and the different ozone formation trends were experimentally evaluated. Known amounts of exhaust gas from a power generator operated using biodiesel and diesel fuels were added to ambient air. The quality of the ambient air, such as the initial NMHC and NO<inf>x</inf> concentrations, and the irradiation intensity have an effect on the ozone levels. When 30 cm3 of biodiesel fuel exhaust gas (BFEG) or diesel fuel exhausted gas (DFEG) was added to 18 dm3 of ambient air, the highest ratios of ozone increase from BFEG compared with DFEG in Japan and Vietnam were 31.2 and 42.8%, respectively, and the maximum ozone increases resulting from DFEG and BFEG compared with the ambient air in Japan were 17.4 and 26.4 ppb, respectively. The ozone increase resulting from the use of BFEG was large and significant compared to that from DFEG under all experimental conditions. The ozone concentration increased as the amount of added exhaust gas increased. The ozone increase from the Jatropha-BFEG was slightly higher than that from waste cooking oil-BFEG. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiesel fuel; Emission; NMHCs; NOx; Ozone increment; Vietnam","Biodiesel; Diesel fuels; Fuels; Gases; Neutron emission; Nitrogen oxides; Oils and fats; Ozone; Bio-diesel fuel; Experimental conditions; Irradiation intensity; NMHCs; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Ozone concentration; Photochemical process; Viet Nam; Air pollution; biodiesel; diesel fuel; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air pollutant; biofuel; exhaust gas; gasoline; air quality; atmospheric pollution; diesel; fuel consumption; nitrogen oxides; nonmethane hydrocarbon; traffic emission; ambient air; Article; comparative study; concentration (parameters); controlled study; irradiation; Japan; photochemistry; Jatropha; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen Oxides; Vehicle Emissions; Vietnam","","diesel fuel, 68334-30-5; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; ozone, 10028-15-6; gasoline, 86290-81-5; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Vehicle Emissions","This research was partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency and Japan International Cooperation Agency , Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS project entitled “Multi-beneficial measure for mitigation of climate change in Vietnam and Indochina countries by development of biomass energy”).","Atkinson, Roger, Atmospheric chemistry of VOCs and NO(x), Atmospheric Environment, 34, 12-14, pp. 2063-2101, (2000); Basha, Syed Ameer, A review on biodiesel production, combustion, emissions and performance, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13, 6-7, pp. 1628-1634, (2009); Basha, Syed Ameer, A review of the effects of catalyst and additive on biodiesel production, performance, combustion and emission characteristics, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 16, 1, pp. 711-717, (2012); Borbon, Agnès, Characterisation of NMHCs in a French urban atmosphere: Overview of the main sources, Science of the Total Environment, 292, 3, pp. 177-191, (2002); Cardone, Massimo, Brassica carinata as an alternative oil crop for the production of biodiesel in Italy: Engine performance and regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions, Environmental Science and Technology, 36, 21, pp. 4656-4662, (2002); Carter, William P.L., Development of ozone reactivity scales for volatile organic compounds, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 44, 7, pp. 881-899, (1994); Updated Maximum Incremental Reactivity Scale and Hydrocarbon Bin Reactivities for Regulatory Applications, (2010); Cartel, William P., An Experimental Study of Incremental Hydrocarbon Reactivity, Environmental Science and Technology, 21, 7, pp. 670-679, (1987); Carter, William P.L., Computer Modeling Study of Incremental Hydrocarbon Reactivity, Environmental Science and Technology, 23, 7, pp. 864-880, (1989); Carter, William P.L., Environmental chamber study of maximum incremental reactivities of volatile organic compounds, Atmospheric Environment, 29, 18, pp. 2499-2511, (1995)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18736424; 02697491","","ENPOE","27396671","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989895568"

The fish’s capacity for aerial breathing enables its farming in earthen ponds with no aeration or little water exchange. We compared the composition and abundance of algal and bacterial cells, the rates of oxygen consumption by microorganisms, and daily fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in fish aquaculture ponds, and compared these to data obtained from shrimp aquaculture ponds in the same locality. We found consistently higher numbers (up to 1.8 × 107 cells/ml) of algae, comprising mostly “Chlorella sp.”, and of bacteria (over 108 cells/ml) in fish ponds than in shrimp ponds. The rate of oxygen consumption in the water of the fish ponds was able to deplete DO within a few hours at night, which was corroborated by a series of 24-h DO measurement data recorded in the fish ponds.

In this paper, we continue to focus on the transform domain and extend it to the novel frequency domain, called q-logarithm frequency domain (q-LFD), for robust watermarking. In order to achieve the robustness of embedding method, we embed the scrambled watermark information into the low-band frequency of q-LFD by using the quantization index modulation (QIM) technique. According to the simulation results, our method can improve the quality of embedded image and also the robustness of watermark based on the optimized parameters: q of q-LFD and Q of QIM. Experimental results show that our proposed method is also robust against geometric attacks, processing attacks, filtering attacks, and so on. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Image watermarking; q-exponential function; q-logarithm frequency domain (q-LFD); q-logarithm function; Quantization index modulation (QIM) technique","Exponential functions; Image watermarking; Modulation; Watermarking; Frequency domains; Geometric attacks; Logarithm function; Optimized parameter; Quantization index modulation; Robust watermarking; Watermark information; Watermarking algorithms; Frequency domain analysis","","","This work is supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) No.24240001, a grant of I-System Co.

A chikungunya (CHIK) outbreak re-emerged in several Asian countries during 2005-2006. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of CHIKV infection in suspected dengue patients in six countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Seven hundred forty-eight serum samples were from dengue-suspected patients in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and 52 were from patients in Fiji. The samples were analysed by CHIKV IgM capture ELISA, CHIKV IgG indirect ELISA and focus reduction neutralization test against CHIKV or RRV. CHIK-confirmed cases in South Asia, particularly Myanmar and Sri Lanka, were 4 6%, and 6 1%, respectively; and in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, were 27 4%, 26 8% and 25 0%, respectively. It suggests that CHIK was widely spread in these five countries in Asia. In Fiji, no CHIK cases were confirmed; however, RRV-confirmed cases represented 53 6% of suspected dengue cases. It suggests that RRV is being maintained or occasionally entering from neighbouring countries and should be considered when determining a causative agent for dengue-like illness in Fiji. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; chikungunya virus; Fiji; Ross River virus; seroepidemiology","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; Alphavirus; Article; Asia; chikungunya; Chikungunya virus; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; Indonesia; major clinical study; Myanmar; nonhuman; Pacific islands; Philippines; prevalence; retrospective study; Ross River virus; serodiagnosis; seroepidemiology; South Asia; Southeast Asia; Sri Lanka; symptomatology; Togaviridae; Viet Nam; virus titration; blood; Chikungunya Fever; dengue; Fiji; incidence; physiology; virology; Asia, Southeastern; Dengue; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Incidence; Neutralization Tests; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Seroepidemiologic Studies","","immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI); Leading Program, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases; Research on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, JST, Japan; and grant(s) in-aid for scientific research by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan","Schwartz, Olivier, Biology and pathogenesis of chikungunya virus, Nature Reviews Microbiology, 8, 7, pp. 491-500, (2010); Pfeffer, Martin, Genus-specific detection of alphaviruses by a semi-nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 57, 6, pp. 709-718, (1997); Caron, Mélanie, Recent introduction and rapid dissemination of chikungunya virus and dengue virus serotype 2 associated with human and mosquito coinfections in gabon, central africa, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 55, 6, pp. e45-e53, (2012); Chahar, Harendra Singh, Co-infections with chikungunya virus and dengue virus in Delhi, India, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 15, 7, pp. 1077-1080, (2009); Powers, Ann M., Changing patterns of chikunya virus: Re-emergence of a zoonotic arbovirus, Journal of General Virology, 88, 9, pp. 2363-2377, (2007); Economopoulou, Assimoula, Atypical Chikungunya virus infections: Clinical manifestations, mortality and risk factors for severe disease during the 2005-2006 outbreak on Réunion, Epidemiology and Infection, 137, 4, pp. 534-541, (2009); Kularatne, Senanayake Abeysinghe Mudiyanselage, Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and long-term outcomes of a major outbreak of Chikungunya in a Hamlet in Sri Lanka, in 2007: A longitudinal cohort study, Journal of Tropical Medicine, (2012); Porter, Kevin Randall, A serological study of Chikungunya virus transmission in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: Evidence for the first outbreak since 1982, Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health, 35, 2, pp. 408-415, (2004); Aaskov, John G., An epidemic of Ross River virus infection in Fiji, 1979., American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 30, 5, pp. 1053-1059, (1981); Bundo, K., Antibody-capture ELISA for detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies in sera from japanese encephalitis and dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, Journal of Virological Methods, 11, 1, pp. 15-22, (1985)","","Cambridge University Press Journals_subscriptions@cup.cam.ac.uk","","","","","","09502688; 14694409","","EPINE","27018566","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961958953"

We applied a paired-catchment analysis to treated (K<inf>T</inf>: 17.1 ha) and control (K<inf>C</inf>: 8.9 ha) catchments. Annual suspended-sediment yield (SSY<inf>an</inf>) in the prethinning period in the K<inf>T</inf> and K<inf>C</inf> catchments was 110.0 and 142.1 kg/ha per year. For the postthinning period, SSY<inf>an</inf> in the K<inf>T</inf> catchment became 5055.6 kg/ha per year, whereas that in the K<inf>C</inf> catchment increased 893.2 kg/ha per year. The paired-catchment analysis revealed that SSY in the K<inf>T</inf> catchment increased 17.0-fold compared with the prethinning period. However, the dominant hysteresis pattern remained clockwise in both pre- and postthinning periods. Sequences of large storm events in the postthinning period elevated SSY in both catchments. Increase in suspended sediment in the K<inf>T</inf> catchment was associated with the combined impacts of thinning and sequences of storm events during the period of thinning operation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Paired-catchment analysis; Strip thinning; Suspended-sediment concentration; Suspended-sediment yield","","","","This research was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) project titled “Development of Innovative Technologies for Increasing Watershed Runoff and Improving the River Environment by the Management of Devastated Forest Plantations.” We thank the members of the Laboratory of Watershed Hydrology and Ecosystem Management, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, for their cooperation.

The discovery that mutations in portions of a P. falciparum gene encoding kelch (K13)-propeller domains are the major determinant of resistance has provided opportunities for monitoring such resistance on a global scale. METHODS We analyzed the K13-propeller sequence polymorphism in 14,037 samples collected in 59 countries in which malaria is endemic. Most of the samples (84.5%) were obtained from patients who were treated at sentinel sites used for nationwide surveillance of antimalarial resistance. We evaluated the emergence and dissemination of mutations by haplotyping neighboring loci. RESULTS We identified 108 nonsynonymous K13 mutations, which showed marked geographic disparity in their frequency and distribution. In Asia, 36.5% of the K13 mutations were distributed within two areas - one in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos and the other in western Thailand, Myanmar, and China - with no overlap. In Africa, we observed a broad array of rare nonsynonymous mutations that were not associated with delayed parasite clearance. The gene-edited Dd2 transgenic line with the A578S mutation, which expresses the most frequently observed African allele, was found to be susceptible to artemisinin in vitro on a ring-stage survival assay. CONCLUSIONS No evidence of artemisinin resistance was found outside Southeast Asia and China, where resistance-associated K13 mutations were confined. The common African A578S allele was not associated with clinical or in vitro resistance to artemisinin, and many African mutations appear to be neutral.

New chemotherapy has been eagerly awaited due to severe side effects and the drug resistance issues plaguing current drugs. Recently, there has been an emphasis on the use of medicinal plants worldwide. Morinda lucida Benth. is a popular medicinal plant widely distributed in Africa, and several research groups have reported on the antiprotozoal activities of this plant. In this study, we identified three novel tetracyclic iridoids, molucidin, ML-2-3, and ML-F52, from the CHCl3 fraction of M. lucida leaves, which possess activity against the GUTat 3.1 strain of T. brucei brucei. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of molucidin, ML-2-3, and ML-F52 were 1.27 μM, 3.75 μM, and 0.43 μM, respectively. ML-2-3 and ML-F52 suppressed the expression of paraflagellum rod protein subunit 2, PFR-2, and caused cell cycle alteration, which preceded apoptosis induction in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma parasites.

The electrochemical oxidation of fucose by an electrode composed of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) sintered on functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) was analysed, and optimal working conditions (pH and fucose concentration) were determined. The fuel cell with an anode of the AuNPs/f-MWCNT-decorated carbon sheet and a cathode of a Pt mesh showed 1.42 V of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and 1967 W cm−2 of maximum power density. Although the power gradually decreased by continuous working for a few hours, it recovered to the original level by rinsing the anode in pure water, suggesting that the catalytic material was sufficiently stable for long-term operation. The operations of a blue light-emitting diode (LED) and a small fan using the direct fucose fuel cell were successfully demonstrated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Brown macroalgae; Carbon nanotube; Gold nanoparticle; Power density","Anodes; Biomass; Carbon nanotubes; Electrochemical oxidation; Electrodes; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Gold; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanoparticles; Nanotubes; Open circuit voltage; Sintering; Yarn; Blue light emitting diodes; Catalytic materials; Electrochemical reactions; Functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes; Gold Nanoparticles; Macro-algae; Maximum power density; Power densities; Light emitting diodes","","","This work is supported by JST, CREST.","Nat Commun, (2014); Sugano, Yasuhito, Direct electrochemical oxidation of cellulose: A cellulose-based fuel cell system, Electroanalysis, 22, 15, pp. 1688-1694, (2010); Bocci, Enrico, Biomass to fuel cells state of the art: A review of the most innovative technology solutions, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 39, 36, pp. 21876-21895, (2014); Le, Quynh Hoa, Direct energy extraction from brown macroalgae-derived alginate by gold nanoparticles on functionalized carbon nanotubes, ChemCatChem, 6, 1, pp. 135-141, (2014); Naruse, Junichi, Development of biofuel cells based on gold nanoparticle decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 30, 1, pp. 204-210, (2011); Wargacki, Adam J., An engineered microbial platform for direct biofuel production from brown macroalgae, Science, 335, 6066, pp. 308-313, (2012); Takeda, Hiroyuki, Bioethanol production from marine biomass alginate by metabolically engineered bacteria, Energy and Environmental Science, 4, 7, pp. 2575-2581, (2011); Kim, Bora, Facile single-step conversion of macroalgal polymeric carbohydrates into biofuels, ChemSusChem, 3, 11, pp. 1273-1275, (2010); Choi, Joonhyuk, Production of brown algae pyrolysis oils for liquid biofuels depending on the chemical pretreatment methods, Energy Conversion and Management, 86, pp. 371-378, (2014); Anastasakis, Konstantinos, Pyrolysis behaviour of the main carbohydrates of brown macro-algae, Fuel, 90, 2, pp. 598-607, (2011)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","14328488; 14330768","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959329859"

Target metabolite profiling approach was selected to demonstrate that Trichoderma longibrachiatum isolated from desert soil can confer beneficial agronomic traits to onion and induce defense mechanism against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepa (FOC), through triggering a number of primary and secondary metabolite pathways. Onion seeds primed with Trichoderma T1 strain displayed early seedling emergence and enhanced growth compared with Trichoderma T2-treatment and untreated control. Therefore, T1 was selected for further investigations under greenhouse conditions, which revealed remarkable improvement in the onion bulb growth parameters and resistance against FOC. The metabolite platform of T1-primed onion (T1) and T1-primed onion challenged with FOC (T1 + FOC) displayed significant accumulation of 25 abiotic and biotic stress-responsive metabolites, representing carbohydrate, phenylpropanoid and sulfur assimilation metabolic pathways. In addition, T1- and T1 + FOC-treated onion plants showed discrete antioxidant capacity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) compared with control. Our findings demonstrated the contribution of T. longibrachiatum to the accumulation of key metabolites, which subsequently leads to the improvement of onion growth, as well as its resistance to oxidative stress and FOC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antioxidant; Metabolite profiling; Onion; Plant growth promoting fungi; Secondary metabolites","antioxidant; biological model; cluster analysis; disease resistance; Fusarium; germination; growth, development and aging; immunology; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; microbiology; onion; physiology; plant disease; plant seed; procedures; Trichoderma; Antioxidants; Cluster Analysis; Disease Resistance; Germination; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Models, Biological; Onions; Plant Diseases; Seeds","","Antioxidants","This work was supported by the Strategic International Research Cooperative Program, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) , and Egyptian mission and culture bureau .

At low temperatures (less than 360 K), the Kerr signal was within noise level. However, large Kerr rotation peaks with a mirror symmetric loop were at high temperatures (higher than 360 K). The temperature dependence of the observed Kerr signal can be attributed to the breaking of spatial inversion symmetry, which induces a narrow gap in surface state bands due to the Ge atomic layer movement-induced phase transition in the superlattice. We found that the resonant field of each Kerr peak gradually decreases with increasing temperature. On the other hand, the phase transition from a high temperature phase to a low temperature one could be controlled by external magnetic fields. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","magneto-optical Kerr effect; superlattice; time-reversal symmetry breaking; Topological insulators; Zeeman effect","Germanium compounds; Magnetic fields; Superlattices; Temperature distribution; Topology; External magnetic field; Induced phase transition; Magnetic field dependences; Magneto-optical Kerr effects; Spatial inversion symmetry; Time reversal symmetries; Topological insulators; Zeeman effect; Optical Kerr effect","","","This work was financially supported by CREST, JST, Japan.","Ovshinsky, Stanford R., Reversible electrical switching phenomena in disordered structures, Physical Review Letters, 21, 20, pp. 1450-1453, (1968); Moore, Joel E., The birth of topological insulators, Nature, 464, 7286, pp. 194-198, (2010); Bernevig, Bogdan Andrei, Quantum spin hall effect and topological phase transition in HgTe quantum wells, Science, 314, 5806, pp. 1757-1761, (2006); Hsieh, David, A topological Dirac insulator in a quantum spin Hall phase, Nature, 452, 7190, pp. 970-974, (2008); Xia, Yuqi, Observation of a large-gap topological-insulator class with a single Dirac cone on the surface, Nature Physics, 5, 6, pp. 398-402, (2009); Hsieh, David, A tunable topological insulator in the spin helical Dirac transport regime, Nature, 460, 7259, pp. 1101-1105, (2009); Wuttig, Matthias, Phase-change materials for rewriteable data storage, Nature Materials, 6, 11, pp. 824-832, (2007); Tominaga, Juniji, A reconsideration of the thermodynamics of phase-change switching, Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research, 249, 10, pp. 1932-1938, (2012); A V Kolobov R Simpson and P Fons in Proceeding of the European Symposium on Phase Change and Ovonic Science Epocs Aachen Germany, (2009); Simpson, Robert Edward, Interfacial phase-change memory, Nature Nanotechnology, 6, 8, pp. 501-505, (2011)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","1543186X; 03615235","","JECMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958753021"

High concentrations (low micrograms per liter) of ASs, including aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose, were found in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents from Vietnam. Three ICMs, iohexol, iopamidol, and iopromide were detected in Vietnamese WWTP influents and effluents, suggesting that these ICMs are frequently used in Vietnam. ASs and ICMs were found in river water from downtown Hanoi at concentrations comparable to or lower than the concentrations in WWTP influents. The ASs and ICMs concentrations in WWTP influents and adjacent surface water significantly correlated (r 2 = 0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting that household wastewater is discharged directly into rivers in Vietnam. Acesulfame was frequently detected in northern Vietnamese groundwater, but the concentrations varied spatially by one order of magnitude even though the sampling points were very close together. This implies that poorly performing domestic septic tanks sporadically leak household wastewater into groundwater. High acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose concentrations were found in surface water from Manila, The Philippines. The sucralose concentrations were one order of magnitude higher in the Manila samples than in the Vietnamese samples, indicating that more sucralose is used in The Philippines than in Vietnam. Acesulfame and cyclamate were found in surface water from Pathein (rural) and Yangon (urban) in Myanmar, but no ICMs were found in the samples. The ASs concentrations were two-three orders of magnitude lower in the samples from Myanmar than in the samples from Vietnam and The Philippines, suggesting that different amounts of ASs are used in these countries. We believe this is the first report of persistent ASs and ICMs having ubiquitous distributions in economically emerging South Asian countries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","acesulfame; aspartame; cyclamate sodium; ground water; iodinated contrast medium; iohexol; iopamidol; iopromide; river water; saccharin; sucralose; surface water; sweetening agent; contrast medium; waste water; water pollutant; concentration (composition); detection method; groundwater; iodine; sucrose; waste treatment; wastewater; water pollution; water quality; X-ray spectroscopy; aquatic environment; Article; effluent; household; Myanmar; Philippines; priority journal; rural area; septic tank; South Asian; urban area; Viet Nam; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; water sampling; X ray; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; sewage; statistics and numerical data; Hanoi; Manila; National Capital Region; Yangon [Myanmar]; Contrast Media; Environmental Monitoring; Sweetening Agents; Vietnam; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical","","acesulfame, 33665-90-6, 55589-62-3; aspartame, 22839-47-0, 5910-52-1; cyclamate sodium, 139-05-9; iohexol, 66108-95-0; iopamidol, 60166-93-0; iopromide, 73334-07-3; saccharin, 81-07-2; sucralose, 56038-13-2; Contrast Media; Sweetening Agents; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","The authors thank Mr. Hiep and other students and staff members in National University of Civil Engineering in Vietnam for their assistance in the field sampling.

In order to obtain the distribution of storm surge heights and damage covering the wide stretch of affected coastline, the authors carried out a series of field surveys in the aftermath of the typhoon (in December 2013, May 2014, and October 2014). In the present paper, the authors detailed the results of these field surveys and summarized the characteristics of the storm surge and main causes of the damage, especially focusing on the Leyte Gulf coast, which is surrounded by the eastern coast of Leyte and the southern coast of Samar.

The storm surge manifested itself on the 8th November 2013 as Haiyan made landfall, devastating large areas in the islands of Leyte and Samar. To attempt to gain an understanding of the level of awareness that local residents had about storm surges the authors conducted structured questionnaires (n = 172) and focus group interviews with local residents, and discussed the results obtained with key informants (government officers and disaster risk managers). One of the key problems identified during the interviews was how people were not able to clearly understand the concept of a storm surge, with many respondents emphasizing how it would have been better for authorities to describe it as a ""tsunami"". A discussion is also made on the recent evolution in world-wide coastal disaster awareness, comparing it to recent developments in storm surge awareness in the Philippines and other countries in the area, such as Vietnam and Japan. The authors conclude that, in terms of its influence on world-wide disaster awareness, typhoon Haiyan constitutes an event of similar importance to major recent high-impact tsunami events such as the 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 Tohoku events. As a result, the authors will outline a number of lessons learnt from Haiyan, such as the necessity for creating multi-layer safety strategies and improving how information about storm surges is transmitted to local residents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","awareness; evacuation preparations; preparedness; resilience; Typhoon Yolanda","Disasters; Hurricanes; Storms; Surveys; Tsunamis; awareness; Coastal disasters; Comparative analysis; Evacuation preparation; Local residents; preparedness; resilience; Safety strategy; Floods","","","Funding text 1: Finally, funds for the field survey were mainly provided by the Strategic Research Foundation Grant-aided Project for Private Universities from the Ministry of Education (Waseda University), and partly by the Global Programme on Sustainability Science Global Leadership Initiative (GPSS-GLI, The University of Tokyo) and J-RAPID Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) (Tokyo Institute of Technology).; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of several Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Office of Civil Defence (OCD), Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical & Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and other Philippines disaster management officials, who provided invaluable information for the elaboration of this manuscript.

Dissolved oxygen sensors and pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry were used for the measurements of photosynthetic efficiency. A Diving-PAM revealed that in situ measurements of the effective quantum yield (Φ<inf>PSII</inf>) were negatively correlated with incident irradiance. Φ<inf>PSII</inf> decreased as irradiance increased at noon and recovered in the evening, suggesting photo-inhibition. A model of the net photosynthesis–irradiance (P-E) relationship determined in a laboratory experiment at 26 °C revealed that the net photosynthetic rate quickly increased at irradiances below the estimated saturation irradiance of 154 μmol photons m−2 s−1 (95 % Bayesian credible interval (BCI) of 117–203 μmol photons m−2 s−1). Gross photosynthesis and dark respiration under the laboratory measurements were also determined over a range of temperatures (8–42 °C), revealing that the gross photosynthetic rates of 8.0 (BCI 7.03–9.59) μg O<inf>2</inf> g<inf>ww</inf> −1 min−1 at 31.1 (BCI 30.2–32.0)°C, and the dark respiration rate increased exponentially from a low of 0.22 μg O<inf>2</inf> g<inf>ww</inf> −1 min−1 at 10 °C to a high of 1.88 μg O<inf>2</inf> g<inf>ww</inf> −1 min−1 at 42 °C. The estimated highest value of the maximum quantum yield (Φ<inf>PSII</inf> at 0 μmol photons m−2 s−1 = F<inf>v</inf>/F<inf>m</inf>) determined with the Imaging-PAM and occurred at 22.2 (BCI 20.8–23.5)°C and was 0.51 (BCI 0.48–0.54). Relative growth rate (RGR) and the survival rate after 2 weeks of laboratory culture showed that the relatively high growth rates (ca. 1.5 %) occurred at 28 and 32 °C; however, mortality was 100 % at 36 °C. This species is considered to be well-adapted to the natural temperature range of study site; however, it is likely close to the marginal temperature conditions. Furthermore, daytime incident irradiance on the frond under fine clear sky might be too strong for the effective photosynthesis of this species, suggesting that optimum irradiance for gross photosynthesis with the minimum decline of Φ<inf>PSII</inf> seems to be much lower. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algae; Diurnal change; Kappaphycus alvarezii; Photosynthesis; Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-chlorophyll fluorometry; Seaweed cultivation","","","","This research was sponsored in part by a CREST (#JAJJ110062) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (SK) and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (#22510033, #25340012, and #25450260) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, and Technology (RT and GNN).

Stretching and pressing techniques were applied during CNT sheet processing to straighten the wavy CNTs and to enhance the dense packing of CNTs in the sheets. Raman spectra measurements showed better CNT alignment in the CNT sheets and the composites after stretching and pressing. Aligned CNT/epoxy composites with CNT volume fraction up to 63.4% were developed using hot-melt prepreg processing with a vacuum-assisted system. Stretching and pressing of the CNT sheets enhanced the mechanical properties of high volume fraction CNT/epoxy composites considerably. Stretching and pressing increased tensile strength of the composites by 32% and elastic modulus of the composites by 27%. Applying stretching and pressing is effective for production of superior CNT sheets with high alignment and dense packing of CNTs, thereby supporting the development of high-performance CNT composites. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","A.

Various commercial NR were used in the present study such as Pale Crepe (PC), Rubber Smoked Sheet (RSS3), Technically Specified Sheet (TSS8®), Standard Thai Rubber (STR5L), and Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR20). As-cast films of the rubbers were prepared by solution casting method and followed by purification by acetone extraction. Chemical structures of the rubbers were elucidated through 1H, 13C-NMR, and DEPT spectroscopy. The 13C-NMR signals at 39.8 and 40.0 ppm were assigned to the trans-1,4-isoprene unit in the trans-trans and cis-trans sequences, respectively, while the signals at 60.8 and 64.5 ppm were assigned to C2 and C3 of an cis epoxy group. The cis epoxy groups were identified for PC, STR5L, RSS3, TSS8®, and SMR20, whereas the trans-1,4-isoprene units from cis-trans isomerization were detected for TSS8® and SMR20. The amount of these groups in TSS8® and SMR20 were higher than those in PC, STR5L, and RSS3. Mechanical properties of TSS8® and SMR20 were found to be inferior to those of PC, STR5L and RSS3. The mechanical properties depended mainly upon the damage of the samples during processing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commercial natural rubber; Epoxidation; Isomerization; NMR; Processing","Acetone; Epoxidation; Isomerization; Isomers; Mechanical properties; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Processing; Acetone extraction; Cis-trans; Cis-trans Isomerization; Epoxy group; Liquid state; Malaysians; NMR signals; Solution-casting method; Rubber","","","This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid ( 26620176 ) for Challenging Exploratory Research and Grant-in-Aid ( 25288098 ) for Scientific Research (B) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and JST - JICA SATREPS.","Burfield, David Roger, Distribution of abnormal groups in natural rubber, Polymer, 17, 8, pp. 713-716, (1976); J Nat Rubber Res, (1997); Proceeding of the International Rubber Conference, (1959); J Rubber Res, (1998); Amnuaypornsri, Sureerut, Character of long-chain branching in highly purified natural rubber, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 115, 6, pp. 3645-3650, (2010); J Nat Rubber Res, (1991); J Nat Rubber Res, (1991); Eng, A.

The genetic diversity of B. bovis merozoite surface antigens (MSAs), such as MSA-1, MSA-2b, and MSA-2c, might be linked to altered immune profiles in the host animals. The present study aimed to develop type-specific PCR assays for Asian msa-. 1 genotypes, thereby re-analyzing the genetic diversity of msa-. 1 in Sri Lanka, Mongolia, and Vietnam. Specific primers were designed for nine Asian msa-. 1 genotypes, which had been detected based on the phylogeny constructed using msa-. 1 gene sequences retrieved from the GenBank database. Specificity of the type-specific PCR assays was confirmed using plasmids containing the inserts of msa-. 1 gene fragments that represent Asian genotypes. Furthermore, no amplicons were observed by these PCR assays when DNA samples of Babesia bigemina, Babesia ovata, Theileria annulata, Theileria orientalis, Trypanosoma evansi, Trypanosoma theileri, Anaplasma marginale, and Anaplasma bovis, and non-infected bovine blood were analyzed. In total, 109 B. bovis-positive blood DNA samples sourced from Sri Lanka (44 cattle), Mongolia (26 cattle), and Vietnam (23 cattle and 16 water buffaloes) were then screened by the type-specific PCR assays. The sequences derived from all of the PCR amplicons were phylogenetically analyzed. Out of 109 DNA samples, 23 (20 from cattle and 3 from water buffaloes) were positive for at least one genotype. In agreement with previous studies, five and four different genotypes were detected among the DNA samples from Sri Lanka and Vietnam, respectively. In contrast, four genotypes, including three novel genotypes, were detected from Mongolia. Five DNA samples were found to be co-infected with multiple genotypes. The sequences of the PCR amplicons clustered phylogenetically within the corresponding clades.

To confirm the absolute configuration of molucidin, we prepared single crystals of molucidin for X-ray analysis. The absolute configuration of the afforded single crystal was determined by X-ray crystallography using a Cu radiation source. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 93 K in the 2θ range 7.468-134.99° and analyzed using the SHELXL-2014 program. The corresponding chiral quaternary carbon atoms in molucidin were unambiguously determined as 1R, 5S, 8S, 9S, and 10S. Notably, both enantiomers of a single molecule, molucidin and oruwacin, with a rigid structure have been isolated from the same plant species. The biosynthetic pathway for the formation of molucidin is also discussed on the basis of the absolute configuration.

Dodecanethiol and octadecanethiol were selected as the short- and long-chain alkanethiols, respectively. The mixed SAMs were formed by immersing AuNPs in a mixed alkanethiol solution at different molar ratios. Au colloidal films were fabricated on indium tin oxide substrates by our previously reported hybrid method. The composition of the two alkanethiolates in the SAM was deduced from the intensity ratio of two Raman bands at 1080 and 1105 cm-1. The surface coverage of the colloidal films increased by forming equimolar or dodecanethiolate-dominant mixed SAMs on AuNPs instead of a pure dodecanethiolate or octadecanethiolate SAM. The highest coverage exceeded 80%. This improvement is attributed to the high dispersion stability of AuNPs covered with equimolar or dodecanethiolate-dominant mixed SAMs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Oxide films; Self assembled monolayers; Tin oxides; Alkanethiolates; Colloidal films; Gold Nanoparticles; High dispersion stabilities; Indium tin oxide substrates; Intensity ratio; Octadecanethiol; Surface coverages; Gold","","","We thank Ms. M.

We find genetic variants at 12 new loci to be associated with blood pressure (P = 3.9 × 10 -11 to 5.0 × 10 -21). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 new loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7 and TBX2) function. The new and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.04 to 8.6 × 10 -6). Our results provide new evidence for the role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","ARHGAP24 gene; Article; blood pressure regulation; CpG island; diastolic blood pressure; DNA methylation; East Asian; European; gene; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; heart left ventricle mass; human; human experiment; IGFBP3 gene; KCNK3 gene; mortality; normal human; OSR1 gene; PDE3A gene; phenotype; PRDM6 gene; priority journal; replication study; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC22A7 gene; South Asian; systolic blood pressure; TBX2 gene; vascular smooth muscle; adult; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; Caucasian; ethnology; female; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; male; middle aged; procedures; regression analysis; risk factor; very elderly; brain natriuretic peptide; peptide fragment; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; DNA Methylation; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors","","brain natriuretic peptide, 114471-18-0; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76)","Funding text 1: Biobank staff for biomedical data collection and preparation.

Despite the reports that DE accounts for only 1-5% of dengue cases, this disease tends to be increasingly reported to threaten global human health throughout dengue endemic areas particularly in Southeast Asia. The molecular information of clinically characterized, neurotropic dengue virus (DENV) in human beings is extremely scarce despite it playing an important role in deciphering the pathogenesis of dengue-related neurological cases. Here we report a case of DE caused by DENV3 genotype III in a male patient with atypical symptoms of DENV infection in Hai Phong, Vietnam in 2013. The virus isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of this case-patient was closely related to DENV3 genotype III strains isolated from serum of two other patients, who manifested classical dengue in the same year and residing in the same area as the case-patient. It is noteworthy to mention that in 2013, DENV3 genotype III was detected for the first time in Vietnam. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atypical DENV infection; Case report; Dengue encephalitis; Dengue serotype 3 genotype III; Phylogenetic analysis","analgesic agent; ceftriaxone; diazepam; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; virus antibody; adult; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterial infection; case report; cerebrospinal fluid; dengue; Dengue virus 3; encephalitis; genotype; headache; human; human cell; laboratory test; leukocyte; leukopenia; male; meningoencephalitis; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; serology; serotype; thrombocyte count; thrombocytopenia; Viet Nam; virus isolation; virus strain; blood; classification; Dengue virus; Encephalitis, Viral; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; genetics; immunology; polymerase chain reaction; virology; Adult; Antibodies, Viral; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Genotype; Humans; Male; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Serogroup; Vietnam","GENBANK: KP893718:KP893719","ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; diazepam, 439-14-5; Antibodies, Viral","Funding text 1: We thank Dr. Ngo Chi Cuong of the Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan and Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam for helping in the collection of clinical data.

The aligned CNT sheets were used to develop aligned CNT/epoxy composites through hot-melt prepreg processing with a vacuum-assisted system. Effects of CNT diameter change on the mechanical properties of aligned CNT sheets and their composites were examined. The reduction of the CNT diameter considerably increased the mechanical properties of the aligned CNT sheets and their composites. The decrease of the CNT diameter along with pressing CNT sheets drastically enhanced the mechanical properties of the CNT sheets and CNT/epoxy composites. Raman spectra measurements showed improvement of the CNT alignment in the pressed CNT/epoxy composites. Research results suggest that aligned CNT/epoxy composites with high strength and stiffness are producible using aligned CNT sheets with smaller-diameter CNTs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","A.

Chemotherapy, which is the main form of control against HAT has been characterized lately by the viewpoints of toxicity and drug resistance issues. Recently, there have been a lot of emphases on the use of medicinal plants world-wide. Morinda lucida Benth. is one of the most popular medicinal plants widely distributed in Africa and several groups have reported on its anti-protozoa activities. In this study, we have isolated one novel tetracyclic iridoid, named as molucidin, from the CHCl<inf>3</inf> fraction of the M. lucida leaves by bioassay-guided fractionation and purification. Molucidin was structurally elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR including HMQC, HMBC, H-H COSY and NOESY resulting in tetracyclic iridoid skeleton, and its absolute configuration was determined. We have further demonstrated that molucidin presented a strong anti-trypanosomal activity, indicating an IC<inf>50</inf> value of 1.27 μM. The cytotoxicity study using human normal and cancer cell lines indicated that molucidin exhibited selectivity index (SI) against two normal fibroblasts greater than 4.73. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was undertaken with molucidin and oregonin, which is identical to anti-trypanosomal active components of Alnus japonica. Overlapping analysis of the lowest energy conformation of molucidin with oregonin suggested a certain similarities of aromatic rings of both oregonin and molucidin. These results contribute to the future drug design studies for HAT. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-trypanosomal activity; Medicinal plants; Molucidin; Morinda lucida; Tetracyclic iridoid","antitrypanosomal agent; iridoid; molucidin; Morinda lucida extract; oregonin; plant extract; unclassified drug; Africa; African trypanosomiasis; antiprotozoal activity; Article; bioassay; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; drug cytotoxicity; drug isolation; drug potency; drug purification; fractionation; heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; human; human cell; IC50; Morinda lucida; nonhuman; nuclear Overhauser effect; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; structure activity relation; animal; cell line; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effects; isolation and purification; Morinda; Trypanosoma; Trypanosomiasis, African; tumor cell line; Alnus japonica; Protozoa; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Iridoids; Models, Molecular; Plant Extracts; Structure-Activity Relationship; Trypanocidal Agents","","oregonin, 55303-93-0; Iridoids; Plant Extracts; Trypanocidal Agents","This study was supported by a Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) Grant from ‘Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)’ – ‘Japan’ and ‘Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)’ – ‘Japan’.","Barrett, Michael Peter, Human African trypanosomiasis: Pharmacological re-engagement with a neglected disease, British Journal of Pharmacology, 152, 8, pp. 1155-1171, (2007); Remme, Jan Hans F., Strategic emphases for tropical diseases research: A TDR perspective, Trends in Microbiology, 10, 10, pp. 435-440, (2002); J Infect Dis, (2009); Sun, Tao, Pentamidine binds to tRNA through non-specific hydrophobic interactions and inhibits aminoacylation and translation, Nucleic Acids Research, 36, 5, pp. 1654-1664, (2008); Barrett, Michael Peter, Drug resistance in human African trypanosomiasis, Future Microbiology, 6, 9, pp. 1037-1047, (2011); Baker, Nicola, Drug resistance in African trypanosomiasis: The melarsoprol and pentamidine story, Trends in Parasitology, 29, 3, pp. 110-118, (2013); Konning, G.

In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity of B. bovis MSA-1, MSA-2b, and MSA-2c genes in Vietnamese cattle and water buffaloes. Blood DNA samples from 258 cattle and 49 water buffaloes reared in the Thua Thien Hue province of Vietnam were screened with a B. bovis-specific diagnostic PCR assay. The B. bovis-positive DNA samples (23 cattle and 16 water buffaloes) were then subjected to PCR assays to amplify the MSA-1, MSA-2b, and MSA-2c genes. Sequencing analyses showed that the Vietnamese MSA-1 and MSA-2b sequences are genetically diverse, whereas MSA-2c is relatively conserved. The nucleotide identity values for these MSA gene sequences were similar in the cattle and water buffaloes. Consistent with the sequencing data, the Vietnamese MSA-1 and MSA-2b sequences were dispersed across several clades in the corresponding phylogenetic trees, whereas the MSA-2c sequences occurred in a single clade. Cattle- and water-buffalo-derived sequences also often clustered together on the phylogenetic trees. The Vietnamese MSA-1, MSA-2b, and MSA-2c sequences were then screened for recombination with automated methods. Of the seven recombination events detected, five and two were associated with the MSA-2b and MSA-2c recombinant sequences, respectively, whereas no MSA-1 recombinants were detected among the sequences analyzed. Recombination between the sequences derived from cattle and water buffaloes was very common, and the resultant recombinant sequences were found in both host animals. These data indicate that the genetic diversity of the MSA sequences does not differ between cattle and water buffaloes in Vietnam. They also suggest that recombination between the B. bovis MSA sequences in both cattle and water buffaloes might contribute to the genetic variation in these genes in Vietnam. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Babesia bovis; Cattle; Genetic diversity; Merozoite surface antigen genes; Vietnam; Water buffalo","Article; Babesia bovis; Bovinae; cladistics; controlled study; gene; gene sequence; genetic recombination; genetic variability; merozoite surface antigen 1 gene; merozoite surface antigen 2b gene; merozoite surface antigen 2c gene; merozoite surface antigen gene; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; sequence analysis; Viet Nam; water buffalo; animal; Babesiosis; bovine; buffalo; genetics; parasitology; phylogeny; Animalia; Bos; Bubalus; protozoal protein; Animals; Buffaloes; Cattle; Genetic Variation; Phylogeny; Protozoan Proteins; Vietnam","","Protozoan Proteins","We thank all the staff and farmers on the farms surveyed in Vietnam.

We then compared the occurrence and fates of PMMoV with pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), which are known wastewater tracers. PMMoV was detected in 94% of the surface water samples (ponds, water from irrigated farmlands and rivers) and in all the wastewater samples. The PMMoV concentration ranged from 5.5×106-7.2×106copies/L in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents, 6.5×105-8.5×105copies/L in WWTP effluents and 1.0×104-1.8×106copies/L in surface water. Among the sixty PPCPs analyzed, caffeine and carbamazepine had high detection rates in surface water (100% and 88%, respectively). In surface water, the concentration ratio of PMMoV to caffeine remained unchanged than that in WWTP influents, suggesting that the persistence of PMMoV in surface water was comparable to that of caffeine. The persistence and the large concentration ratio of PMMoV in WWTP influents to the method detection limit would account for its ubiquitous detection in surface water. In comparison, human enteric viruses (HEV) were less frequently detected (18-59%) than PMMoV in surface water, probably because of their faster decay. Together with the reported high human feces-specificity, our results suggested that PMMoV is useful as a sensitive fecal indicator for evaluating the potential occurrence of pathogenic viruses in surface water. Moreover, PMMoV can be useful as a moderately conservative fecal tracer for specifically tracking fecal pollution of surface water. PMMoV was detected in 38% of the groundwater samples at low concentrations (up to 19copies/L). PMMoV was not detected in the tap water and bottled water samples. In groundwater, tap water and bottled water samples, the occurrence of PPCPs and HEV disagreed with that of PMMoV, suggesting that PMMoV is not suitable as an indicator or a tracer in those waters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Caffeine; Carbamazepine; Fecal indicator; Human enteric virus; QPCR; Wastewater tracer","Amides; Caffeine; Effluents; Groundwater; River pollution; Sewage treatment plants; Tracers; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Carbamazepine; Comparative evaluations; Fecal indicators; Human enteric virus; Pepper mild mottle virus; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; QPCR; Wastewater treatment plants; Surface waters; caffeine; carbamazepine; ground water; tap water; drinking water; drug; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; comparative study; effluent; fecal coliform; surface water; tracer; virus; wastewater; water pollution; water treatment; Article; concentration (parameters); Escherichia coli; feces analysis; irrigation (agriculture); limit of detection; plant virus; pond; river; sensitivity analysis; Viet Nam; waste water treatment plant; water analysis; water pollution indicator; water sampling; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; procedures; Tobamovirus; virology; Hanoi; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Sewage; Vietnam; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants","","caffeine, 58-08-2; carbamazepine, 298-46-4, 8047-84-5; Drinking Water; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Pollutants","The authors acknowledge the financial support by the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) project grant for ‘Development of Well-balanced Urban Water Use System Adapted for Climate Change’ from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) Number 25257304 .

To acquire glucose repression-defective strains, 33 isolates as 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG)-resistant mutants were acquired from about 100 colonies grown on plates containing 2-DOG, which were derived from an efficient strain DMKU 3-1042. According to the characteristics of sugar consumption abilities and cell growth and ethanol accumulation along with cultivation time, they were classified into three groups. The first group (3 isolates) utilized glucose and xylose in similar patterns along with cultivation to those of the parental strain, presumably due to reduction of the uptake of 2-DOG or enhancement of its export. The second group (29 isolates) showed greatly delayed utilization of glucose, presumably by reduction of the uptake or initial catabolism of glucose. The last group, only one isolate, showed enhanced utilization ability of xylose in the presence of glucose. Further analysis revealed that the isolate had a single nucleotide mutation to cause amino acid substitution (G270S) in RAG5 encoding hexokinase and exhibited very low activity of the enzyme. The possible mechanism of defectiveness of glucose repression in the mutant is discussed in this paper. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2-deoxyglucose-resistant mutants; Ethanol fermentation on xylose; Glucose repression; Kluyveromyces marxianus; Thermotolerant yeast","alcohol; deoxyglucose; fungal protein; hexokinase; xylose; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; chemistry; enzymology; fermentation; genetics; Kluyveromyces; metabolism; missense mutation; molecular genetics; sequence alignment; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Deoxyglucose; Ethanol; Fermentation; Fungal Proteins; Hexokinase; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation, Missense; Sequence Alignment; Xylose","","alcohol, 64-17-5; deoxyglucose, 154-17-6; hexokinase, 9001-51-8; xylose, 25990-60-7, 58-86-6; Deoxyglucose; Ethanol; Fungal Proteins; Hexokinase; Xylose","Acknowledgements.

In rootbox (25 cm × 40 cm × 2 cm) experiment, three fertilizer N levels; (30 (low), 60 (standard) and 120 mg N (high) per rootbox) were used while in pot (5 L) experiment, six N forms (NH<inf>4</inf> +-N alone, NO<inf>3</inf> −-N alone, combined NH<inf>4</inf> +-N and NO<inf>3</inf> −-N with and without dicyandiamide (nitrification inhibitor) were used at the rate of 360 mg N per pot.Results: In both experiments, CSSL50 and Nipponbare had no significant differences in shoot and root growth regardless of N levels and N forms under CWL conditions. However, under WD conditions, CSSL50 had significantly greater dry matter production (DMP) than Nipponbare due to the greater ability of the former for maintaining soil water uptake and photosynthesis. The observed higher water uptake and photosynthesis in CSSL50 under WD was closely related to its promoted root system development due to plasticity, which were significantly greater at high N than at low N level. The extent of promotion in root system development based total root length was not significantly different among N forms.Conclusions: The root system plasticity of CSSL50 in response to WD was expressed at a greater degree with high level of N applied and the functional roles of root plasticity for greater soil water uptake and DMP were due to WD regardless of N forms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ammonium; Chromosome segment substitution lines; Dry matter production; Nitrate; Root plasticity; Water deficit","adaptation; ammonium; chromosome; drought stress; dry matter; nitrate; phenotypic plasticity; rice; root; soil nitrogen","","","We thank Dr. Jonathan M.

Since diagnosis is an important aspect of surra control, development of novel diagnostic antigens is of interest to implement and improve the currently utilized methods. Our study evaluated the tandem repeat antigen TeGM6-4r in T. evansi antibody detection in water buffaloes. TeGM6-4r-based ELISA was performed with 20 positive and 8 negative controls and 484 field samples from water buffaloes in Northern Vietnam. To examine cross-reactivity, sera from Japanese cattle that had been experimentally infected with Theileria orientalis (n=10), Babesia bovis (n=3), Babesia bigemina (n=7) and Trypanosoma theileri (n=59) were included in the study. The sensitivity of the test was 80%. TeGM6-4r did not react with Theileria or Babesia infected sera, however it showed cross reactivity with 11/59 T. theileri infected samples. The reference test, CATT/. T. evansi also reacted with 3/59 T. theileri infected sera. The lysate antigen-based ELISA reacted with 4/59 T. theileri, 9/10 Theileria and 3/10 Babesia infected sera. In contrast, TeGM6-4r-based ELISA was 86.3% sensitive and 58.3% specific in the screening of field samples. The average seroprevalence of T. evansi infection among water buffaloes in Northern Vietnam was 27.1% by CATT/. T. evansi and 53.7% by TeGM6-4r. Seroprevalence in the five surveyed provinces ranged from 17.4% to 39.8% in the reference test, and 47.3% to 67.3% in the recombinant antigen based test. The finding indicated that the disease is still widely endemic in the area and that surveillance programs need to be carried out regularly to better control surra. We proposed TeGM6-4r as a useful serodiagnostic antigen for the detection and epidemiological surveillance of T. evansi infection among water buffaloes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Seroprevalence; Tandem repeat antigen; Trypanosoma evansi; Vietnam; Water buffalo","GM6 4r antigen; recombinant antigen; unclassified drug; antibody detection; article; controlled study; cross reaction; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; intermethod comparison; nonhuman; sensitivity and specificity; seroprevalence; surra; tandem repeat; Viet Nam; water buffalo; Animalia; Babesia; Babesia bigemina; Babesia bovis; Bos; Bubalus; Theileria; Theileria orientalis; Trypanosoma evansi; Trypanosoma theileri; Seroprevalence; Tandem repeat antigen; Vietnam; Water buffalo; Animals; Antibodies, Protozoan; Antigens, Protozoan; Buffaloes; DNA, Recombinant; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Sensitivity and Specificity; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Tandem Repeat Sequences; Trypanosoma; Trypanosomiasis","","","Field surveillance was conducted under the supervision of the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In addition, we also examined the effects of environmental change on rice cultivation in the last decade. In the VMD, multiple rice cropping is practiced under a variety of adverse water conditions, including flooding, salinity intrusion, and irregular monsoon rains. These environmental changes influence the durations of growing seasons and the number of crops per year, resulting in changes in productivity. To validate the performance of the model, we compared model estimates for the heading date and changes in leaf area index at nine sites with estimates of these parameters derived from MODIS satellite time series data for the period 2002-2006. The root mean square errors of heading date between the modeled and satellite data in the upper, middle, and coastal regions of the delta were 17.6, 11.2, and 13.0 days, respectively. Based on the model, we examined case studies to assess the changes in cropping cycles and crop failures in the VMD due to extreme flooding in 2000 and salinity intrusion in 2004 by applying evaluation indices defined by available period for cultivation (APC) and safe margin for cropping (SMC) which is defined as the marginal time between APC and the period required for cultivation. Findings of case studies suggested that a small difference in the SMC of the cropping pattern is critical to the stability and productive capacity of the rice crop. © 2013 Springer Japan. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive behavior; Crop calendar; Crop failure; MODIS; Vulnerability","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Cultivation; Floods; Mean square error; Radiometers; Rain; Scheduling; Water resources; Adaptive behavior; Crop failures; Environmental change; MODIS; Productive capacity; Resource Constraint; Root mean square errors; Vulnerability; Crops; cropping practice; cultivation; flooding; leaf area index; monsoon; rice; salinity; satellite data; time series analysis; water resource; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","Acknowledgments We thank Dr. Cao Van Phung of the Cuu Long Delta Rice Research Institute, Vietnam, for conducting our field surveys and providing valuable information.

A sampling method for rain and the materials of a rain collector were also surveyed. Benzene and a glass bottle were used to prevent the decrease of PAHs in rainwater. The average concentration of Σ9PAHs in rainwater ranged between 17.49 and 646.52 ng dm-3. The mean ratio of these Σ9PAHs in gas versus particles was 77.9 and 68.3 % during rain and no rain, respectively. During rain, the PAHs in particles were scavenged by rain and were incorporated via washout by collision with each other. Therefore, the ratio of PAHs in rainwater was similar to that in particles. The low molecular weight LMW-PAHs from gas were recognized as being dissolved in rain but did not affect the ratio of PAHs in rain. Four rings PAH were dominant in gas/rain/particles. The seasonal variation of Σ9PAHs in rainwater was reported and discussed, and the PAHs levels during the winter and spring were higher compared with that of summer and autumn.

Of the 4,550 samples collected, 226 influenza A virus isolates were obtained from domestic ducks, muscovy ducks, and chickens. Of these, 25 and 22 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) were isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in live-bird markets and slaughtering sites in northern and southern Vietnam, respectively. The HA genes of H5 viruses isolated from birds in northern Vietnam phylogenetically belonged to the genetic clade 2.3.2.1 and those in southern Vietnam belonged to the genetic clade 1.1. In addition, 39 H3, 12 H4, 1 H5, 93 H6, 2 H7, 18 H9, 3 H10, and 11 H11 viruses were isolated. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H6 and H9 viruses revealed that they were closely related to the isolates obtained from domestic poultry in China. Phylogenetic analyses of internal gene segments of these isolates revealed that these viruses were circulating in both domestic and wild birds in Asia and reassortment events had occurred frequently. Therefore, it will be important to continue the surveillance and strict controls over the movement and trade of poultry and poultry products in order to eradicate H5N1 HPAIV from Asia. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Avian influenza virus; H5N1; Live-bird market; Reassortment; Surveillance; Vietnam","animal experiment; antigenic variation; article; avian influenza; avian influenza virus; chicken; domestic animal; duck; genetic reassortment; genetic variability; Influenza virus A H5N1; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; priority journal; Viet Nam; virus gene; virus isolation; virus mutation; virus strain; Anas platyrhynchos; Aves; Avian influenza virus; Cairina moschata; Gallus gallus; Influenza A virus; Animals; Antigenic Variation; Chickens; Cluster Analysis; Ducks; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza in Birds; Molecular Epidemiology; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; RNA, Viral; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology; Vietnam","","","Acknowledgments We thank Drs.

The pathogenesis of influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (hereafter, ""H5N1"") infection in humans is not completely understood, although hypercytokinemia is thought to play a role. We previously reported that most H5N1 viruses induce high cytokine responses in human macrophages, whereas some H5N1 viruses induce only a low level of cytokine production similar to that induced by seasonal viruses.Methods. To identify the viral molecular determinants for cytokine induction of H5N1 viruses in human macrophages, we generated a series of reassortant viruses between the high cytokine inducer A/Vietnam/UT3028II/03 clone 2 (VN3028IIcl2) and the low inducer A/Indonesia/UT3006/05 (IDN3006) and evaluated cytokine expression in human macrophages.Results. Viruses possessing the acidic polymerase (PA) gene of VN3028IIcl2 exhibited high levels of hypercytokinemia-related cytokine expression in human macrophages, compared with IDN3006, but showed no substantial differences in viral growth in these cells. Further, the PA gene of VN3028IIcl2 conferred enhanced virulence in mice.Conclusions. These results demonstrate that the PA gene of VN3028IIcl2 affects cytokine production in human macrophages and virulence in mice. These findings provide new insights into the cytokine-mediated pathogenesis of H5N1 infection in humans. © The Author 2012.

The neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor oseltamivir is widely used to treat patients infected with influenza viruses. An Ile-to-Val change at position 117 in influenza A virus subtype H5N1 NA (NA-I117V) confers a reduction in susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate. However, the in vivo relevance and molecular basis of the decreased sensitivity mediated by this mutation are poorly understood. Methods. We created single-point-mutant viruses with 3 genetically different backgrounds (ie, 1 belonging to clade 1 and 2 belonging to clade 2.3.4) and evaluated the effects of the I117V mutation on oseltamivir susceptibility in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. Results. The NA-I117V mutation conferred a slight reduction in susceptibility to oseltamivir in vitro (1.3- to 6.3-fold changes), although it did not substantially compromise NA enzymatic activity. Mice infected with I117V virus exhibited reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and decreased survival in 2 of 3 virus pairs tested. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that I117V caused the loss of hydrogen bonds between an arginine at position 118 and the carboxyl group of oseltamivir, leading to a lower binding affinity for oseltamivir. Conclusions. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of NA-I117V-mediated oseltamivir resistance in highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses. © The Author 2012. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","H5N1; I117V mutation; Influenza Avirus; Molecular dynamics simulation; Neuraminidase; Oseltamivir","arginine; carboxyl group; isoleucine; oseltamivir; sialidase; sialidase inhibitor; valine; amino acid substitution; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; avian influenza virus; binding affinity; drug sensitivity; enzyme activity; female; gene mutation; hydrogen bond; in vitro study; in vivo study; influenza A (H5N1); Influenza virus A H5N1; molecular dynamics; molecular mechanics; morbidity; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; virus survival; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Birds; Drug Resistance, Viral; Enzyme Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Neuraminidase; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Oseltamivir; Point Mutation; Poultry; Viral Proteins; Virus Replication","","arginine, 1119-34-2, 15595-35-4, 7004-12-8, 74-79-3; isoleucine, 7004-09-3, 73-32-5; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; sialidase, 9001-67-6; valine, 7004-03-7, 72-18-4; Antiviral Agents, 0; Enzyme Inhibitors, 0; Neuraminidase, 3.2.1.18; Oseltamivir, 0; Viral Proteins, 0","Financial support.

In the current study, we generated several recombinant RCN constructs expressing influenza (H5N1) antigens and a molecular adjuvant (Heat-Labile enterotoxin B from E. coli: RCN-LTB), demonstrated their expression in vitro, and evaluated their ability to protect mice against H5N1 virus challenge. RCN-HA provided strong protection when administered intradermally (ID), but not intranasally (IN). Conversely, the RCN-neuraminidase (NA) construct was highly efficacious by the IN route and elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice. Vaccination by combined ID (RCN-HA) and IN (RCN-NA) routes offered mice the best protection against an IN challenge with heterologous H5N1 virus.

In the surface layer (<150m), the flow fluctuation is predominant and is excited by the sudden strong eastward flow with speeds greater than 20cms-1 in the central part of the bay. This flow is a part of an intrusion of Kuroshio water via the Oshima West Channel into the bay and/or a cyclonic circulation in the northern part of the bay. The cyclonic circulation, which is approximately balanced under the geostrophic flow relationship, is mainly generated or enhanced by the intrusion, which is accompanied by eastward propagation of the small meander of the Kuroshio south of Japan during the transition from the nearshore non-large-meander path (nNLM) to the offshore non-large-meander path (oNLM), regardless of season. The water temperature fluctuation in the subsurface layer (∼150m) is caused by upwelling of cold deeper water and is closely related to the eastward flow fluctuations in the surface layer in the central part of the bay. Our analysis leads us the conclusion that the upwelling occurs as the response of the subsurface density field to the surface flow field under the Earth's rotation. Additionally, the intrusion of Kuroshio water via the Oshima West Channel tends to cause, not only cyclonic circulation and upwelling in the northern part of the bay, but also the Kyucho, which is the coastal density current under the Earth's rotation, in the bay's coastal area during the non-large-meander path (NLM). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Coastal area; Cyclonic circulation; Density currents; Earth's rotation; Eastward propagation; Flow fluctuations; Geostrophic flow; Hydrographic data; Kuroshio; Kuroshio waters; Nearshores; Sagami Bay; Subsurface density; Subsurface layer; Surface flow; Surface layers; Water temperatures; Temperature distribution; Ocean currents; cyclone; Earth rotation; flow field; hydrography; nearshore dynamics; temperature anomaly; upwelling; water flow; water temperature; Honshu; Japan; Kanto","","","The present study was supported by the Solution Oriented Research for Science and Technology (SORST) project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

We examined the pH stability of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian IAV (HPAI) NAs and identified amino acids responsible for conferring stability at low pH. We found that, unlike other avian viruses, most H5N1 IAVs isolated since 2003 had NAs that were unstable at low pH, similar to human epidemic IAVs. These H5N1 viruses are thus already human virus-like and, therefore, have the frequent infections of humans. © 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Avian influenza A virus; H5N1; Highly pathogenic; Low-pH stability; Neuraminidase; Sialidase","virus sialidase; article; enzyme activity; enzyme structure; human; human cell; Influenza virus A H5N1; nonhuman; pH measurement; priority journal; Aves; Influenza A virus","","","We thank Susan Watson for scientific editing.

Out of the 27 H9 virus isolates, the hemagglutinins of 18 strains were genetically classified as belonging to the sublineage G1, and the other nine belonged to the Korean sublineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one of the 27 H9 viruses was a reassortant in which the PB2 gene belonged to the Korean sublineage and the other seven genes belonged to the G1 sublineage. Three representative H9N2 viruses were intranasally inoculated into ducks, chickens, pigs, and mice. On the basis of experimental infection studies, it was found that each of the three viruses readily infected pigs and replicated in their upper respiratory tracts, and they infected chickens with slight replication. Viruses were recovered from the lungs of mice inoculated with two of the three isolates. The present results reveal that H9 avian influenza viruses are prevailing and genetic reassortment occurs among domestic ducks in Vietnam. It is recommended that careful surveillance of swine influenza with H9 viruses should be performed to prepare for pandemic influenza. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","","animal; article; avian influenza; Bagg albino mouse; bird disease; chicken; classification; domestic animal; duck; female; genetic reassortment; genetics; human; influenza; Influenza virus A; Influenza virus A H9N2; isolation and purification; male; molecular genetics; mouse; orthomyxovirus infection; pathogenicity; phylogeny; swine; swine disease; Viet Nam; virology; virulence; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Chickens; Ducks; Female; Humans; Influenza A virus; Influenza A Virus, H9N2 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Molecular Sequence Data; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Phylogeny; Poultry Diseases; Reassortant Viruses; Swine; Swine Diseases; Vietnam; Virulence; Anas; Anas platyrhynchos; Aves; Avian influenza virus; Gallus gallus; Mus; Suidae","GENBANK: AB545591, AB545592, AB545593, AB545594, AB571519, AB571520, AB571521, AB571522, AB571523, AB571524, AB571525, AB571526, AB571527, AB571528, AB571529, AB571530, AB571531, AB571532, AB571533, AB571534, AB571535, AB571536, AB571537, AB571538, AB571539, AB572587, AB621343, AB636530, AB636531, AB636532, AB636533, AB636534, AB636535, AB636536, AB636537, AB638312, AB638313, AB638314, AB638315, AB638316, AB638317, AB638318, AB638319, AB638320, AB638321, AB638322, AB638323, AB638324, AB638325, AB638326, AB638327, AB638603, AB638604, AB638605, AB638606, AB638607, AB638608, AB638609, AB638610, AB638611, AB638612, AB638613, AB638614, AB638615, AB638616, AB638617, AB638618, AB638619, AB638620, AB638621, AB638622, AB638623, AB638624, AB638625, AB638626, AB638627, AB638628, AB638629, AB638630, AB638631, AB638632, AB638633, AB638634, AB638635, AB638636, AB638637, AB638638, AB638639, AB638640, AB638641, AB638642, AB638643, AB638644, AB638645, AB638646, AB638647, AB638648, AB638649, AB638650, AB638651, AB638652, AB638653, AB638654, AB638655, AB638656, AB638657, AB638658, AB638659, AB638660, AB638661, AB638662, AB638663, AB638664, AB638665, AB638666, AB638667, AB638668, AB638669, AB638670, AB638671, AB638672, AB638673, AB638674, AB638675, AB638676, AB638677, AB638678, AB638679, AB638680, AB638681, AB638682, AB638683, AB638684, AB638685, AB638686, AB638687, AB638688, AB638689, AB638690, AB638691, AB638692, AB638693, AB638694, AB638695, AB638696, AB638697, AB638698, AB638699, AB638700, AB638701, AB638702, AB638703, AB638704, AB638705, AB638706, AB638707, AB638708, AB638709, AB638710, AB638711, AB638712, AB638713, AB638714, AB638715, AB638716, AB638717, AB638718, AB638719, AB638720, AB638721, AB638722, AB638723, AB638724, AB638725, AB638726, AB638727, AB638728, AB638729, AB638730, AB638731, AB638732, AB638733, AB638734, AB638735, AB638736, AB638737, AB638738, AB638739, AB638740, AB638741, AB638742, AB638743, AB638744, AB638745, AB638746, AB638747, AB638748, AB638749, AB638750, AB638751, AB638752, AB638753, AB638754, AB638755, AB638756, AB638757, AB638758, AB638759, AB638760, AB638761, AB639024, AB639025, AB639026, AB639027, AB639028, AB639029, AB639030, AB639351, AB639352, AB639353, AB639354, AB639355, AB639356","","We thank Dr. Kennedy F.

However, information detailing exposure to perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) other than PFOA is limited. We measured the concentrations of PFCAs (from perfluorohexanoic acid to perfluorotetradecanoic acid) in serum samples obtained from patients in Japan (Sendai, Takayama, Kyoto and Osaka) between 2002 and 2009, Korea (Busan and Seoul) between 1994 and 2008 and Vietnam (Hanoi) in 2007/2008. Total PFCA levels (geometric mean) were increased from 8.9ngmL-1 to 10.3ngmL-1 in Japan; from 7.0ngmL-1 to 9.2ngmL-1 in Korea; and were estimated at 4.7ngmL-1 in Vietnam. PFCAs of greater length than PFOA were significantly increased in Sendai, Takayama and Kyoto, Japan, and levels of long-chain PFCAs exceeded PFOA levels in serum. Among these PFCAs, perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) was the predominant component (28.5%), followed by perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA 17.5%), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA 7.9%), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA 6.1%) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA 1.8%). Odd-numbered PFCAs (PFNA, PFUnDA and PFTrDA) were also observed in Korea and Vietnam and their presence increased significantly in Korea between 1994 and 2007/2008. The proportion of long-chain PFCAs in serum was relatively high compared to reports in Western countries.

To investigate dicofol as a possible source of the DDTs in human breast milk, we collected breast milk samples from 2007 to 2009 in China (Beijing), Korea (Seoul, Busan) and Japan (Sendai, Takarazuka and Takayama). Using these breast milk samples, we quantified the concentrations of dichlorobenzophenone, a pyrolysis product of dicofol (simply referred to as dicofol hereafter), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) using GC-MS. Overall, 12 of 14 pooled breast milk samples from 210 mothers contained detectable levels of dicofol (>0.1ngg-1 lipid). The geometric mean concentration of dicofol in the Japanese breast milk samples was 0.3ngg-1 lipid and significantly lower than that in Chinese (9.6ngg-1 lipid) or Korean breast milk samples (1.9ngg-1 lipid) (p<0.05 for each). Furthermore, the ΣDDT levels in breast milk from China were 10-fold higher than those from Korea and Japan. The present results strongly suggest the presence of extensive emission sources of both dicofol and DDTs in China. However, exposure to dicofol cannot explain the large exposure of Chinese mothers to DDTs because of the trace levels of dicofol in the ΣDDTs. In the present study, dicofol was confirmed to be detectable in human breast milk. This is the first report to identify dicofol in human samples. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; DDTs; Dicofol; Human milk; Japan; Korea","Atmospheric chemistry; Chemistry; China; DDTs; Dicofol; Human milk; Japan; Korea; Metabolites; chlorphenotane; dicofol; pesticide; breastfeeding; DDT; gas chromatography; lipid; mass spectrometry; milk; organochlorine; pollution exposure; pyrolysis; quantitative analysis; article; breast feeding; breast milk; chemical structure; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; human; measurement; milk level; Beijing [China]","","chlorphenotane, 50-29-3; dicofol, 115-32-2","This study was mainly supported by Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology (No. 1300001) sponsored by the Japan Science and Technology Agency, a Grant-in-Aid for Health Sciences Research from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (H21-Food-003) and a Korea-Japan Joint Research Project under the KOSEF-JSPS Cooperative Program.

Influenza, therefore, remains a serious health threat. Currently, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are the mainstay for influenza therapy; however, drug-resistant mutants of seasonal H1N1 and H5N1 viruses have emerged highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic approaches. One such approach is antibody immunotherapy. Here, we show that the monoclonal antibody C179, which recognizes a neutralizing epitope common among H1, H2, H5, and H6 hemagglutinins (HAs), protected mice from a lethal challenge with various H5N1 and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses when administered either intraperitoneally or intranasally. The protective efficacy of intranasally inoculated C179 was comparable to that of intraperitoneal administration. Our results suggest that direct administration of this anti-influenza antibody to viral replication sites is an effective strategy for prophylaxis and therapy. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","H5N1; Monoclonal antibody Immunotherapy; Pandemic (H1N1) 2009","epitope; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody C179; unclassified drug; virus hemagglutinin; animal experiment; animal model; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; article; controlled study; drug dosage form comparison; drug efficacy; female; immunotherapy; influenza A (H1N1); influenza A (H5N1); Influenza virus A H1N1; Influenza virus A H5N1; mouse; nonhuman; pandemic influenza; priority journal; rat; virus replication; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Cross Reactions; Drug Administration Routes; Epitopes; Female; Hemagglutinins; Humans; Immunotherapy; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Molecular Sequence Data; Pandemics; Avian influenza virus; Mus; Orthomyxoviridae","","Antibodies, Monoclonal, 0; Antibodies, Neutralizing, 0; Antibodies, Viral, 0; Epitopes, 0; Hemagglutinins, 0","We thank Susan Watson for editing the manuscript.

However, it is still unclear whether current H5N1 strains also induce high TNF-α production, as most of the data were derived from extinct clade 0 H5N1 strain. Here, we show that current clade 1 and 2 H5N1 strains induce variable levels of TNF-α that are not necessarily higher than those induced by seasonal influenza viruses. The result suggests that hyper-induction of TNF-α in human macrophages is not always associated with a highly pathogenic phenotype. We further tested the contribution of the NS gene segment from H5N1 isolates to TNF-α induction by using reverse genetics. While NS conferred some variation in TNF-α induction when incorporated into an H1N1 virus genetic background, it did not affect TNF-α induction in an H5N1 virus genetic background, suggesting that other viral genes are involved. © 2010 Springer-Verlag. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","","NS protein, influenza virus; tumor necrosis factor alpha; virus protein; animal; article; avian influenza; biosynthesis; bird; human; immunology; influenza; Influenza virus A; Influenza virus A H1N1; Influenza virus A H3N2; Influenza virus A H5N1; macrophage; virology; Animals; Birds; Humans; Influenza A virus; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Macrophages; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Aves; Avian influenza virus; human influenza virus; Orthomyxoviridae","","NS protein, influenza virus, 0; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, 0; Viral Nonstructural Proteins, 0","This project was supported by a research grant from the Thailand Research Fund (BRG5180008).

One of major manufacturers, 3M Company voluntarily phased out PFOS production in 2002. We measured the PFOS and PFOA concentrations in serum samples from Japan (Sendai, Takayama and Osaka), Korea (Busan and Seoul) and Vietnam (Hanoi) to evaluate the possible effects of the phase-out on the serum levels. There were spatial differences in both the serum PFOS and PFOA concentrations. The serum PFOS concentrations (ng mL-1) evaluated as the geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) in 2007-2008 ranged from 4.86 (1.45) in Sendai, Japan, to 9.36 (1.42) in Busan, Korea. The serum PFOA concentrations ranged from 0.575 (2.32) in Hanoi, Vietnam, to 14.2 (1.73) in Osaka, Japan. Historically archived samples collected from Korea in 1994-2008 revealed that the serum PFOA concentrations increased by 1.24-fold in Busan from 2000 to 2008 and 1.41-fold in Seoul from 1994 to 2007. On the other hand, the serum PFOS concentrations did not change from 1994 to 2007/2008. The serum PFOS levels in Japan in 2008 were significantly decreased compared with previously reported values (22.3-66.7% of the values in 2003/2004). However, the serum PFOA levels showed a clear decline from 2003 to 2008 in a high-exposed area, Osaka, but not in low-exposed areas in Japan. The trends toward decreases were not uniformly observed in Asian countries, unlike the case for the United States, suggesting that local factors associated with the production and introduction histories in each country overwhelm the effects of the phase-out. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparing with previous surveys, the present study indicates that the DDTs in breast milk from China and Vietnam had gradually decreased during the last decade, but were still 5-10 times higher than those in other nations. The ratios of p,p′-DDE/p,p′-DDT and o,p′-DDT/p,p′-DDT were higher in Beijing than in the other countries, suggesting that there is less fresh intake of commercial DDT products and a possible exposure to dicofol in China. CHL and PCB levels were relatively higher in mothers from Japan, whereas β-HCH and HCB were more common in Chinese women. In Japan, it is suspected that mothers in the urban/coastal area (Sendai) were more continuously exposed to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) than mothers in the rural/inland area (Takayama). In addition, OCP levels in primiparae were significantly higher than those in multiparae from Japan and Korea. These indicate that both parity and regional factors are major determinants of the levels of OCPs and PCBs in human milk. On the other hand, higher concentrations of PBDEs were observed in mothers' milk from Korea. The congener was dominated by BDE-47 (43-54%), followed by BDE-153 (23-33%) in all regions except for Beijing where BDE-28 (23%) was relatively abundant. In Japanese breast milk, regional and parity-dependent distributions were not observed for PBDEs. Among PBDE congeners, age-dependency was observed for BDE-153, which was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) to the age of mothers in Kyoto (17 participants were housewives), while it increased with age in Sendai (10 participants were clerks). No such correlation was seen for BDE-47, indicating that BDE-47 was ingested and assimilated via different kinetics or routes from BDE-153 in Japan. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Human and avian influenza A viruses differ in their recognition of host cell receptors: the former preferentially recognize receptors with saccharides terminating in sialic acid-α2,6- galactose (SAα2,6Gal), whereas the latter prefer those ending in SAα2,3Gal (refs 3-6). A conversion from SAα2,3Gal to SAα2,6Gal recognition is thought to be one of the changes that must occur before avian influenza viruses can replicate efficiently in humans and acquire the potential to cause a pandemic. By identifying mutations in the receptor-binding haemagglutinin (HA) molecule that would enable avian H5N1 viruses to recognize human-type host cell receptors, it may be possible to predict (and thus to increase preparedness for) the emergence of pandemic viruses. Here we show that some H5N1 viruses isolated from humans can bind to both human and avian receptors, in contrast to those isolated from chickens and ducks, which recognize the avian receptors exclusively. Mutations at positions 182 and 192 independently convert the HAs of H5N1 viruses known to recognize the avian receptor to ones that recognize the human receptor. Analysis of the crystal structure of the HA from an H5N1 virus used in our genetic experiments shows that the locations of these amino acids in the HA molecule are compatible with an effect on receptor binding. The amino acid changes that we identify might serve as molecular markers for assessing the pandemic potential of H5N1 field isolates. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Biomarkers; Carboxylic acids; Cells; Epidemiology; Mutagenesis; Avian influenza; Mutations; Pandemic viruses; Receptors; Sialic acid; Viruses; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; molecular marker; mutant protein; receptor; avian influenza; crystal structure; genetic analysis; influenza; mutation; protein; virus; amino acid substitution; animal cell; article; controlled study; epidemic; Influenza virus A; molecular recognition; nonhuman; priority journal; protein structure; receptor binding; structure analysis; virus isolation; virus mutation; Anas; Aves; Avian influenza virus; Gallus gallus; Influenza A virus","","","Acknowledgements We thank K.

Least-clouded day- and night-scenes of TERRA/ MODIS acquired between 2001 and 2003 were selected to generate land-surface temperature (LST) maps. Spatial patterns of UHIs for each city were examined over its diurnal cycle and seasonal variations. A Gaussian approximation was applied in order to quantify spatial extents and magnitude of individual UHIs for inter-city comparison. To reveal relationship of UHIs with surface properties, UHI patterns were analyzed in association with urban vegetation covers and surface energy fluxes derived from high-resolution Landsat ETM+ data. This study provides a generalized picture on the UHI phenomena in the Asian region and the findings can be used to guide further study integrating satellite high-resolution thermal data with land-surface modeling and meso-scale climatic modeling in order to understand impacts of urbanization on local climate in Asia. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
