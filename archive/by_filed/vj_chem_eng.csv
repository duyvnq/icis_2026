Lattice strain engineering can create such a special property by disrupting the uniformity of the crystal structure. Herein, it is triggered by the simultaneous contribution of sulfur doping (Sₓ) and point defects (oxygen vacancies, OVₓ) to create non-uniform strain. Low-electronegativity S dopants with wide and polarized 3p orbitals replace the host O atoms in the lattice of pristine Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> (denoted as S<inf>0</inf>OV<inf>0</inf>CO), reducing the ionic character but increasing the covalency of Co–S bonds, thereby increasing the Co's electron density in these bonds. OVₓ, meanwhile, remove O2⁻ ions, increasing the delocalization of the surrounding Co and enhancing the unoccupied states’ density of Co 3d. Therefore, the highest Sₓ level and OVₓ density synergistically make S<inf>3</inf>OV<inf>3</inf>CO the most efficient PMS activator after excluding specific surface area, with a normalized rate constant of 0.00854 min⁻1⋅m⁻2⋅g (greater than 0.00751 min⁻1⋅m⁻2⋅g for S<inf>0</inf>OV<inf>3</inf>CO without Sₓ). Compared with OVₓ, more appreciable in reducing the adsorption energy (-7.64 to −7.73 eV for one and two OVₓ), Sₓ enhances the activation to a lesser extent with incremental Sₓ level (-6.83 to −7.03 eV for one and two S dopants), but it simultaneously augments the formation of OVₓ. Ultimately, S<inf>3</inf>OV<inf>3</inf>CO/PMS is capable of forming assorted reactive species, degrading outright benzophenone-2 and tetracycline within eight minutes. This study offers a singular prospect of tailoring properties of metal oxides through non-uniform strain induced by the interplay of dopants and defects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","D-band Center; Electron Delocalization; Lattice Strain Engineering; Oxygen Vacancies; Pms Activation; S-doped Co3o4; Sulfur Doping; Activation Energy; Carrier Concentration; Catalysts; Chemical Bonds; Cobalt; Cobalt Compounds; Doping (additives); Electronegativity; Point Defects; Rate Constants; Sulfur; Sulfur Compounds; D-band Centers; Electron Delocalization; Lattice Strain; Lattice Strain Engineering; Non-uniform Strain; Peroxymonosulfate Activations; S-doped; S-doped Co3o4; Strain Engineering; Sulfur Doping; Oxygen Vacancies","Activation energy; Carrier concentration; Catalysts; Chemical bonds; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Doping (additives); Electronegativity; Point defects; Rate constants; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; D-band centers; Electron delocalization; Lattice strain; Lattice strain engineering; Non-uniform strain; Peroxymonosulfate activations; S-doped; S-doped co3O4; Strain engineering; Sulfur doping; Oxygen vacancies","","","","Wang, Wenqi, Different activation methods in sulfate radical-based oxidation for organic pollutants degradation: Catalytic mechanism and toxicity assessment of degradation intermediates, Science of the Total Environment, 772, (2021); Xu, Zhenqi, Enhanced levofloxacin degradation by hierarchical porous Co3O4 with rich oxygen vacancies activating peroxymonosulfate: Performance and mechanism, Separation and Purification Technology, 304, (2023); Fang, Zhimo, Revealing the Synergistic Effect of Cation and Anion Vacancies on Enhanced Fenton-Like Reaction: The Electron Density Modulation of O 2p−Co 3d Bands, Small, 20, 42, (2024); Deng, Jing, Iron-doped ordered mesoporous Co3O4 activation of peroxymonosulfate for ciprofloxacin degradation: Performance, mechanism and degradation pathway, Science of the Total Environment, 658, pp. 343-356, (2019); Zhang, Hang, Co3O4 with upshifted d-band center and enlarged specific surface area by single-atom Zr doping for enhanced PMS activation, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 448, (2023); Zou, Lingxiao, Nitrogen-doped cobalt oxide via atmospheric modulation activates PMS for rapid degradation of organic pollutants: Role of nitrogen fraction on sulfapyridine elimination, Journal of Water Process Engineering, 67, (2024); Xie, Hengyi, Interfacial bonding of Co3O4 and oxygen vacancies engineering on ZnO induced efficient peroxymonosulfate activation and pollutants degradation, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 674, pp. 813-822, (2024); Xue, Xiaojin, MgO/Co3O4 composite activated peroxymonosulfate for levofloxacin degradation: Role of surface hydroxyl and oxygen vacancies, Separation and Purification Technology, 306, (2023); Rafiq, Muhammad Naveed, Highly efficient degradation of norfloxacin by using Co3O4-CeO2 as a heterogeneous catalyst through peroxymonosulfate activation: Characterization, catalytic performance and mechanism, Journal of Water Process Engineering, 71, (2025); Wang, Feng, Rapid peroxymonosulfate activation by self-assembly of layered fluorine-free MXene with nanofibrous Co3O4: Antibiotic degradation and electron transfer mechanism, Separation and Purification Technology, 329, (2024)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09263373","","ACBEE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008102489"

Eddy current (EC) testing is widely used due to its non-contact nature and high sensitivity to surface and sub-surface cracks. This study reports a flexible eddy current array (FECA) sensor with six bendable channels designed to detect surface and sub-surface cracks in the weld zones of steel structures. The excitation coils are connected in series to enhance signal intensity, while interleaved detection coils minimize lift-off effects and improve sensitivity. A real-time measurement system was developed by integrating the FECA sensor with a LabVIEW-based digital lock-in amplifier. Experiments using 500 kHz and 5 kHz excitation frequencies demonstrated effective detection of surface and sub-surface cracks, respectively, including under zinc coatings. Despite manual scanning, stable and repeatable signals were recorded across multiple channels. The proposed system offers high sensitivity, real-time capability, and adaptability to complex geometries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. 22H01724 and supported by Fire and Disaster Management Agency Promotion Program for Scientific Fire and Disaster Prevention Technologies Program Grant Number JPJ000255.","Gupta, Mridul, Advances in applications of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT): A review, Advances in Materials and Processing Technologies, 8, 2, pp. 2286-2307, (2022); Katunin, Andrzej, Damage identification in aircraft composite structures: A case study using various non-destructive testing techniques, Composite Structures, 127, pp. 1-9, (2015); Arâmburu, Arthur Behenck, Non-destructive testing techniques for pressure vessels manufactured with polymer composite materials: A systematic review, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 246, (2025); Bensaber, Ahmed, The assessment of concrete subjected to compressive and flexural preloading using nondestructive testing methods, correlation between concrete strength and combined method (SonReb), Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 222, (2023); Fu, Lanling, Artificial neural network-based damage detection of composite material using laser ultrasonic technology, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 220, (2023); Xu, Pengju, Rail crack detection and evaluation at high speed based on differential ECT system, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 166, (2020); Xu, Pengju, Study on high-speed rail defect detection methods based on ECT, MFL testing and ACFM, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 206, (2023); Trung, Le Quang, Crack detection in low carbon steel using Rotating Uniform Eddy Current probe and noise signal filtering based on Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis, Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, 362, (2023); Wang, Xiujing, Response Analysis of MEMS Magnetic Field Sensor Based on Eddy Current Effect, pp. 377-381, (2023); Trung, Le Quang, Crack detection using a cutting-edge flexible eddy current sensor with voltage and phase measurement techniques, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 219, (2024)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","27313395","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011719907"

However, as the industry pursues profit targets, there is also a pressing need to consider its sustainability. One challenge is the lack of detailed information on the life cycle of natural rubber products, particularly regarding energy consumption, which could hinder sustainable practices. Based on an on-site survey of six natural rubber processing companies in the Southeast and Central Highlands of Vietnam, this field research aims to evaluate the sustainability of the natural rubber industry by examining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy and water consumption throughout the life cycle of all products. Over two years, biogas, wastewater, and sludge samples were collected multiple times from each factory involved in the research and facilitated with both testing the characteristics and components of these samples, as well as calculating their carbon footprint by the 2006 Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). GHG emissions from the two most dominant Vietnamese natural rubber products were 589 and 133 kg CO<inf>2</inf>eq., respectively, generated from each ton of Standard Vietnamese Rubber (SVR) and Centrifuged Latex (CL) products produced. Our study identified three main sources of GHG emissions in the Vietnamese natural rubber industry: high electricity use during the SVR production process, vast ammonia requirements for the CL production process, and direct CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from the regulation tanks of the wastewater processes. Most surveyed factories have taken significant steps in adopting sustainable practices to reduce their GHG emissions. By combining conventional efforts of factories with GHG emission calculations during this field trip, our research proposes significant energy-saving executions to promote sustainable development in the regional natural rubber industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Usage; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Industrial Wastewater; Natural Rubber Industry","","","","This research was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) Program (JPMJSA2103).","undefined, (2023); undefined, (2023); undefined, (2023); 2006 Ipcc Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, (2006); Mohammadi, Mitra, Treatment of wastewater from rubber industry in Malaysia, African Journal of Biotechnology, 9, 38, pp. 6233-6243, (2010); Vidanagama, Jagathdeva, Energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions associated with tea and rubber manufacturing processes in Sri Lanka, Environmental Development, 26, pp. 43-54, (2018); Sharib, Shabinah, Enhancing value chains by applying industrial symbiosis concept to the Rubber City in Kedah, Malaysia, Journal of Cleaner Production, 141, pp. 1095-1108, (2017); Jawjit, Warit, Evaluating environmental performance of concentrated latex production in Thailand, Journal of Cleaner Production, 98, pp. 84-91, (2015); Int J Environ Sci Dev, (2016); Marrero Nunes, Felipe, Environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of natural rubbers: A review and scientometric analysis, Industrial Crops and Products, 224, (2025)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","26660164","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007463085"

Two MFCs types were constructed: one with magnetite pre-inoculated anodes (MFCM) and another with sludge-only inoculated anodes (MFCS). Both MFCs were operated with either starch or ethanol as the cosubstrate, and in both cases, MFCM consistently outperformed MFCS. For instance, with starch, MFCM achieved 99 % decolorization and a peak voltage of 380.74 mV within 30 hours, compared to 89 % and negligible, unstable voltage in MFCS. A 1500 Ω resistance was optimal for decolorization and electricity generation in MFCM. Microbial analysis revealed that magnetite pre-inoculation enriched electroactive genera, enhanced diversity and extracellular electron transfer, and stabilized microbial networks across cosubstrates. These findings highlight the potential of magnetite pre-inoculated anodes as a novel practical strategy for early anode biofilm control, with significant implications for scalable MFCs applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Azo Dye; Ethanol; Magnetite Pre-inoculation; Microbial Community Analysis; Microbial Fuel Cells; Starch; Alcohol; Magnetite; Starch; Coloring Agents; Ethanol; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Starch; Wastewater; Anodes; Bioelectric Phenomena; Electron Transitions; Electrophysiology; Gas Fuel Purification; Wastewater Treatment; Azo-dyes; Cell Types; Cosubstrates; Decolourization; Dyeing Wastewater; Dyes Treatment; Magnetite Pre-inoculation; Microbial Community Analysis; Microbials; Reactive Black 5; Ethanol; Microbial Fuel Cells; Starch; Alcohol; Azo Dye; Fuel; Magnetite; Starch; Coloring Agent; Biofilm; Dye; Electricity Generation; Electrode; Fuel Cell; Inoculation; Microbial Community; Wastewater Treatment; Article; Bioenergy; Controlled Study; Decolorization; Electric Potential; Electricity; Electron Transport; Microbial Fuel Cell; Nonhuman; Sewage Treatment; Sludge; Wastewater; Chemistry; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Procedures; Water Management; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biofilms; Coloring Agents; Electricity; Electrodes; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Wastewater; Water Purification","Anodes; Bioelectric phenomena; Electron transitions; Electrophysiology; Gas fuel purification; Wastewater treatment; Azo-dyes; Cell types; Cosubstrates; Decolourization; Dyeing wastewater; Dyes treatment; Magnetite pre-inoculation; Microbial community analysis; Microbials; Reactive black 5; Ethanol; Microbial fuel cells; Starch; alcohol; azo dye; fuel; magnetite; starch; coloring agent; biofilm; dye; electricity generation; electrode; fuel cell; inoculation; microbial community; wastewater treatment; Article; bioenergy; controlled study; decolorization; electric potential; electricity; electron transport; microbial fuel cell; nonhuman; sewage treatment; sludge; wastewater; chemistry; isolation and purification; microbiology; procedures; water management; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biofilms; Coloring Agents; Electricity; Electrodes; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Wastewater; Water Purification","","alcohol, 64-17-5; magnetite, 1309-38-2, 1317-61-9; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Coloring Agents; Ethanol; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Starch; Wastewater","The authors thank Mr. Hirotoshi Netsu for his technical support and Nagaoka Chou Joka Center for providing anaerobic sludge.

Sharply increasing salinity to 5.0 and 15.0 g NaCl/L caused adverse effects on the performance, resulting in loss of active biomass and reduction in organic removal and nitrification capacity. Specifically, the abundance of Proteobacteria declined from 81.5 % at 2.5 g NaCl/L to 56.1 % at 5.0 g NaCl/L and 43.5 % at 15.0 g NaCl/L. Higher salinities (10 – 15 g NaCl/L) promoted irreversible fouling (R<inf>f</inf> was 33.5–40.6 %) due to the increased secretion of soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which adsorbed onto the membrane pores. The presence of Chlorofexi could promote the formation of larger flocs and a decrease in irreversible fouling. Ultimately, the optimal condition for an anoxic MBR treating saline wastewater could be up to 15.0 g NaCl/L, suitable for various industrial applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Microbial Community; Nitrification; Physical Cleaning; Trans-membrane Pressure Recovery; Treatment Performance; Sodium Chloride; Membranes, Artificial; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Biological Water Treatment; Membrane Fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Sodium Chloride; Surface Treatment; Wastewater Treatment; Irreversible Fouling; Long-term Effects; Microbial Communities; Microbial Membranes; Physical Cleanings; Pollutants Removal; Pressure Recovery; Trans-membrane Pressure Recovery; Transmembrane Pressures; Treatment Performance; Bioreactors; Nitrification; Sodium Chloride; Anoxic Conditions; Biomass; Bioreactor; Fouling; Microbial Community; Nitrification; Pollutant Removal; Salinity; Wastewater Treatment; Adsorption; Article; Chloroflexi; Controlled Study; Fouling Control; Nonhuman; Particle Size; Pollutant; Polymerization; Pressure; Proteobacteria; Wastewater; Water Quality; Anaerobic Growth; Artificial Membrane; Biofouling; Chemistry; Devices; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Procedures; Water Management; Water Pollutant; Anaerobiosis; Biofouling; Biomass; Membranes, Artificial; Salinity; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification","Biological water treatment; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Sodium chloride; Surface treatment; Wastewater treatment; Irreversible fouling; Long-term effects; Microbial communities; Microbial membranes; Physical cleanings; Pollutants removal; Pressure recovery; Trans-membrane pressure recovery; Transmembrane pressures; Treatment performance; Bioreactors; Nitrification; sodium chloride; anoxic conditions; biomass; bioreactor; fouling; microbial community; nitrification; pollutant removal; salinity; wastewater treatment; adsorption; Article; Chloroflexi; controlled study; fouling control; nonhuman; particle size; pollutant; polymerization; pressure; Proteobacteria; wastewater; water quality; anaerobic growth; artificial membrane; biofouling; chemistry; devices; isolation and purification; microbiology; procedures; water management; water pollutant; Anaerobiosis; Biofouling; Biomass; Membranes, Artificial; Salinity; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification","","sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1; Membranes, Artificial; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2025-20-16.

The samples were fabricated using the conventional solid state reaction technique and their structure was analyzed using Cu-K edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The offset temperature (T<inf>c</inf>, <inf>offset</inf>) decreased with increasing applied magnetic field where the resistivity dropped to zero and T<inf>c</inf>, <inf>offset</inf> decreased from 95.76 K at 0 T to 47.62 K at 7 T. The maximum upper critical field (B<inf>c2</inf>) was 100.24 K at 0.5 T for the sample doped with x = 0.1 % weight ratio with CTAB, while the minimum value was 95.75 K for the sample doped with x = 0.2 % weight ratio without CTAB. The XANES spectra showed a decrease in the valence state value of Cu. The Fourier transformation of the EXAFS structure demonstrated a monotonous increase in the values of Cu-O bond length and Debye Waller factor, possibly explaining the decrease in the critical temperature (T<inf>c</inf>) of the samples. However, improvements in the upper critical field (B<inf>c2</inf>) of Bi-2223 ceramics were achieved by adding FePd nanoparticles with the use of proper additional contents. By combining the characteristic parameters of small bundle pinning (B<inf>sb</inf>), large bundle pinning (B<inf>lb</inf>), irreversibility (B<inf>irr</inf>), and B<inf>c2</inf> fields, the field temperature (B-T) vortex phase diagrams of Bi-2223 phase were well established. An obvious expansion of the B-T vortex phase diagram of FePd-added Bi-2223 samples compared with that of the pure one was observed. Such expansion could be attributed to the addition of FePd nanoparticles, which effectively worked as volume (three-dimensional) pinning centers.

The results reveal that doped WS<inf>2</inf>/G heterostructures show electronic characteristics of metallic materials, which are beneficial for their application as high-performance anode materials. The introduction of B/C dopants significantly enhance the binding affinity for sodium intercalation at active sites, both on the surface and at interfacial region, with binding energies reaching up to −1.702 eV, which can mitigate sodium dendrite formation during electrochemical cycling. Notably, the presence of B/C dopants can create energetically favorable diffusion pathway both on the surface and in the interfacial region of the WS<inf>2</inf>/G bilayers for sodium ions with energy barriers ranging from 0.091 to 0.494 eV, underscoring their potential to support high-rate charge/discharge processes. Additionally, B/C-doped WS<inf>2</inf>/G heterostructures exhibit inconsiderably structural deformation during sodium intercalation, making them suitable candidates as anode materials in batteries with high cycling stability. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effect of the dopants within the sodium intercalation mechanisms of WS<inf>2</inf>/G heterostructures, paving the way for the rational design of next-generation anode materials for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anode Materials; Anodes; Binding Sites; Boron; Density Functional Theory; Design For Testability; Diffusion Barriers; Doping (additives); Graphene; Heterojunctions; Intercalation; Sodium; Sulfur Compounds; Tungsten Compounds; Anode Material; Energy; Graphene Bilayers; Intercalation Mechanisms; Interfacial Region; Ion Intercalation; Ion Migration; Sodium Ion Batteries; Sodium Ions; Ws 2; Binding Energy; Electronic Structure; Metal Ions; Sodium-ion Batteries","Anode materials; Anodes; Binding sites; Boron; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Diffusion barriers; Doping (additives); Graphene; Heterojunctions; Intercalation; Sodium; Sulfur compounds; Tungsten compounds; Anode material; Energy; Graphene bilayers; Intercalation mechanisms; Interfacial region; Ion intercalation; Ion migration; Sodium ion batteries; Sodium ions; WS 2; Binding energy; Electronic structure; Metal ions; Sodium-ion batteries","","","The authors acknowledge the support provided by the VinUniversity Center for Environmental Intelligence under Flagship Projects VUNI.CEI.FS_0005.","Wakihara, Masataka, Recent developments in lithium ion batteries, Materials Science and Engineering R: Reports, 33, 4, pp. 109-134, (2001); Fang, Ruopian, More Reliable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Status, Solutions and Prospects, Advanced Materials, 29, 48, (2017); Peng, Shiyun, Alleviating the Storage Instability of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2Cathode Materials by Surface Modification with Poly(acrylic acid), ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, 9, 22, pp. 7466-7478, (2021); Balogun, M． Sadeeq (Jie Tang), A review of carbon materials and their composites with alloy metals for sodium ion battery anodes, Carbon, 98, pp. 162-178, (2016); Mamoor, Muhammad, Recent progress on advanced high energy electrode materials for sodium ion batteries, Green Energy and Resources, 1, 3, (2023); Ghosh, Sourav, WS2 anode in Na and K-ion battery: Effect of upper cut-off potential on electrochemical performance, Electrochimica Acta, 383, (2021); Kang, Biyu, Facile fabrication of WS2nanocrystals confined in chlorella-derived N, P co-doped bio-carbon for sodium-ion batteries with ultra-long lifespan, Dalton Transactions, 50, 41, pp. 14745-14752, (2021); Latha, Malyala, WS2/Graphene composite as cathode for rechargeable aluminum-dual ion battery, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 167, 7, (2020); Raccichini, Rinaldo, The role of graphene for electrochemical energy storage, Nature Materials, 14, 3, pp. 271-279, (2015); Ji, Liwen, Graphene-Based Nanocomposites for Energy Storage, Advanced Energy Materials, 6, 16, (2016)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20462069","","RSCAC","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010702578"

In this study, we use first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory to explore the effect of strain on the TE performance of 2D vdW heterobilayer MoTe<inf>2</inf>/PtS<inf>2</inf>. A strong Rashba spin-splitting is observed in the valence band, resulting in an increase in the Seebeck coefficient for the p-type. The lattice thermal conductivity of MoTe<inf>2</inf>/PtS<inf>2</inf> is remarkably low, about 0.6 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K, due to large anharmonic scattering. Furthermore, biaxial strain enhances the power factor (PF) by introducing band convergence. At a strain of 2%, the optimal PF for the n-type material reaches 170 μW/cmK2, indicating an approximately 84.78% increase compared to the unstrained state (92 μW/cmK2). Given the low lattice thermal conductivity, the optimized figure of merit ZT achieves up to 0.88 at 900 K for the n-type. Our findings indicate that MoTe<inf>2</inf>/PtS<inf>2</inf> is a highly promising candidate for 2D heterobilayer TE materials owing to its strong Rashba splitting and significant anharmonicity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d Van Der Waals Heterobilayer Mote2/pts2; Anharmonicity; Band Convergence; Density Functional Theory; Rashba Spin−orbit Coupling; Thermoelectricity; Crystal Lattices; Molybdenum Compounds; Statistical Mechanics; Tellurium Compounds; Thermal Conductivity; Thermoelectricity; Anharmonicities; Band Convergence; Density-functional-theory; Lattice Thermal Conductivity; Rashba Spin-orbit Coupling; Splittings; Thermoelectric Performance; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional Van Der Waal Heterobilayer Mote2/pts2; Van Der Waal; Density Functional Theory","Crystal lattices; Molybdenum compounds; Statistical mechanics; Tellurium compounds; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectricity; Anharmonicities; Band convergence; Density-functional-theory; Lattice thermal conductivity; Rashba spin-orbit coupling; Splittings; Thermoelectric performance; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional van der waal heterobilayer mote2/PtS2; Van der Waal; Density functional theory","","","N.T.H. acknowledges the financial support from Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Tohoku University.","Biswas, Kanishka, Thermoelectric materials science and technology toward applications, Applied Physics Letters, 121, 7, (2022); Vining, Cronin B., An inconvenient truth about thermoelectrics, Nature Materials, 8, 2, pp. 83-85, (2009); Introduction to Thermoelectricity, (2009); van Thanh, Vuong, Janus 2D B2P6: A promising anisotropic thermoelectric material with high power factor, Surfaces and Interfaces, 44, (2024); Sov Phys Semicond, (1992); Zhao, Wenrui, Chemical doping of organic semiconductors for thermoelectric applications, Chemical Society Reviews, 49, 20, pp. 7210-7228, (2020); Tuan Hung, Nguyen, Quantum Effects in the Thermoelectric Power Factor of Low-Dimensional Semiconductors, Physical Review Letters, 117, 3, (2016); Tuan Hung, Nguyen, The Origin of Quantum Effects in Low-Dimensional Thermoelectric Materials, Advanced Quantum Technologies, 4, 1, (2021); Tang, Yinglu, Convergence of multi-valley bands as the electronic origin of high thermoelectric performance in CoSb3 skutterudites, Nature Materials, 14, 12, pp. 1223-1228, (2015); Tuan Hung, Nguyen, Thermoelectric performance of monolayer InSe improved by convergence of multivalley bands, Journal of Applied Physics, 125, 8, (2019)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","25740962","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009515324"

The total PFAS concentrations ranged from below the detection limits to 185 ng/L, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) emerging as the predominant compound, followed by perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Elevated PFAS levels were observed downstream of the confluence between the Daku River and Litouzhou ditch, suggesting contributions from industrial activities. Principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) were employed to identify important components and factors that explain different compounds. Factor 1 (dominated by PFUnA) was attributed to sources such as food packaging and textiles. Factor 2 (PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS) originated from agricultural inputs and wastewater discharges linked to the semiconductor and photonics industries. Factor 3 (PFOA, PFNA, PFDA) was primarily associated with fluoropolymer manufacturing, electronics, chemical engineering, machinery, and coating production. Ecological risk assessments showed no significant threats (RQ < 0.1) for PFBS, PFPA, PFNA, PFOS, and PFDA. Human health risk evaluations based on the Health Risk Index (HRI < 1), likewise, indicated negligible risk from crop and vegetable consumption in the Daku River area. These findings underscore the importance of continued monitoring and targeted pollution management strategies to safeguard environmental quality and public health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Occurrence; Pfass; Risk Assessment; Seasonal Variation; Source Identification; Perfluorodecanoic Acid; Perfluorododecanoic Acid; Perfluorononanoic Acid; Perfluorooctanoic Acid; Perfluoroundecanoic Acid; Perfluoro Compound; Perfluorobutanesulfonic Acid; Perfluorobutyl Sulfonate; Perfluorodecanoic Acid; Perfluorododecanoic Acid; Perfluoroheptanoic Acid; Perfluorohexyl Sulfonate; Perfluorononanoic Acid; Perfluorooctanoic Acid; Perfluorooctyl Sulfonate; Perfluoroundecanoic Acid; River Water; Surface Water; Unclassified Drug; Article; Chemical Engineering; Coating (procedure); Comparative Study; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Crop; Ecotoxicology; Electronics Industry; Environmental Exposure; Food Contamination; Food Packaging; Health Hazard; Health Risk Assessment; Human; Industrial Area; Limit Of Detection; Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Machine; Photonics; Pollution Monitoring; Quality Control; River; Seasonal Variation; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Textile Industry; Urban Area; Vegetable Consumption; Water Pollution; Water Sampling","perfluoro compound; perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; perfluorobutyl sulfonate; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexyl sulfonate; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluorooctyl sulfonate; perfluoroundecanoic acid; river water; surface water; unclassified drug; Article; chemical engineering; coating (procedure); comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; crop; ecotoxicology; electronics industry; environmental exposure; food contamination; food packaging; health hazard; health risk assessment; human; industrial area; limit of detection; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; machine; photonics; pollution monitoring; quality control; river; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; textile industry; urban area; vegetable consumption; water pollution; water sampling","","perfluorodecanoic acid, 335-76-2; perfluorododecanoic acid, 307-55-1; perfluorononanoic acid, 375-95-1; perfluorooctanoic acid, 335-67-1; perfluoroundecanoic acid, 2058-94-8","This study was supported by grants from the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) of Taiwan (NSTC 113-2221-E-033-017-MY2).","Barzen-Hanson, Krista A., Discovery of 40 Classes of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Historical Aqueous Film-Forming Foams (AFFFs) and AFFF-Impacted Groundwater, Environmental Science and Technology, 51, 4, pp. 2047-2057, (2017); Lindstrom, Andrew B., Polyfluorinated compounds: Past, present, and future, Environmental Science and Technology, 45, 19, pp. 7954-7961, (2011); Prevedouros, Konstantinos, Sources, fate and transport of perfluorocarboxylates, Environmental Science and Technology, 40, 1, pp. 32-44, (2006); Kedikoglou, Kleopatra, Preliminary assessment of general population exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances through diet in Greece, Environmental Research, 177, (2019); Schiavone, Consolato, PFAS: A Review of the State of the Art, from Legislation to Analytical Approaches and Toxicological Aspects for Assessing Contamination in Food and Environment and Related Risks, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2023); Zafeiraki, Effrosyni F., Occurrence of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in a large number of wild and farmed aquatic animals collected in the Netherlands, Chemosphere, 232, pp. 415-423, (2019); Barry, Vaughn, Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposures and incident cancers among adults living near a chemical plant, Environmental Health Perspectives, 121, 11-12, pp. 1313-1318, (2013); Sagiv, Sharon K., Sociodemographic and Perinatal Predictors of Early Pregnancy Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance (PFAS) Concentrations, Environmental Science and Technology, 49, 19, pp. 11849-11858, (2015); Chem Int, (2019); Kunacheva, Chinagarn, Contamination of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in Chao Phraya River and Bangpakong River, Thailand, Water Science and Technology, 60, 4, pp. 975-982, (2009)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","23056304","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009086508"

Using a DR-EcoScreen bioassay, we measured the biological equivalency (BEQ) levels in serum samples from 32 men exposed to dioxins in Bien Hoa and 32 unexposed men in Hanoi, Vietnam. For the Bien Hoa men, the World Health Organization toxic equivalent (WHO-TEQ) levels of dioxins had already been measured by instrumental analysis. The difference in fat-based BEQ levels between exposed and unexposed men was greater than for crude BEQ levels, with a strong correlation between fat-based BEQ and WHO-TEQ levels. The fat-based BEQ levels in Bien Hoa men with longer residency but lower WHO-TEQ levels were significantly higher than those in unexposed men and Bien Hoa men with shorter residency but higher WHO-TEQs, suggesting that fat-based BEQ may be an effective marker of dioxin-like activity. Additionally, comparisons of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and TEQs between shorter- and longer-residency groups indicated that higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), particularly TCDD, contribute to increased BEQ levels.

In unconventional shale reservoirs, gas adsorption is the primary storage mechanism. This study introduces a novel one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) to predict gas adsorption. The 1D-CNN model was compared with traditional machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), and Gradient Boosting (GB). Using a dataset of 352 samples with key features - pressure, temperature, TOC, and moisture content - the 1D-CNN achieved superior predictive accuracy, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.015 and R of 0.9949, outperforming other models. Sensitivity analysis identified moisture content as the most influential factor affecting adsorption. Validation using unseen methane adsorption data demonstrated that the PIDL model generalizes well and produces physically consistent predictions. Overall, the PIDL-enhanced 1D-CNN model advances methane adsorption prediction by integrating domain-specific physical laws into a deep learning framework, facilitating more efficient shale gas extraction and improved carbon sequestration practices. This hybrid approach not only reduces experimental costs but also provides consistent and reliable results, offering a robust solution for real-world applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Neutrality; Co2sequestration; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn), Ccus; Deep Learning; Gas Adsorption; Next Generation Reservoir Simulator For Ccs; Shale Gas Reservoir; Deep Neural Networks; Carbon Neutralities; Co2sequestration; Convolutional Neural Network; Convolutional Neural Network , Ccus; Deep Learning; Methane Adsorption; Next Generation Reservoir Simulator For Ccs; One-dimensional; Reservoir Simulator; Shale Gas Reservoirs; Convolutional Neural Networks","Deep neural networks; Carbon neutralities; CO2sequestration; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network , CCUS; Deep learning; Methane adsorption; Next generation reservoir simulator for CCS; One-dimensional; Reservoir simulator; Shale gas reservoirs; Convolutional neural networks","","","This study was supported by the Waseda University Research Institute for Science and Engineering under the Encouraged Research Program (Grant No. BA070Z000500 ).

RESULTS: The synthesis of an iron oxides/zeolite X composite (IOZX) was investigated at room temperature with an iron salt to zeolite X ratio of 10 wt%, an ion exchange time of 5 h and 15% NaOH. With a surface area of 312 m2 g−1, the obtained IOZX also comprised SiO<inf>2</inf> (40.96%), Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (32.08%), Na<inf>2</inf>O (24.07%) and Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (2.72%). Besides, the uniform distribution of iron oxide particles in the composite was determined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. IOZX exhibited excellent CV removal performance at concentrations ranging from 200 to 500 mg L−1. After 30 min, 96.87% of CV was removed at the optimal conditions such as pH 7, a catalyst dose of 0.5 g L−1, 10 mmol L−1 H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentration and a 300 mg L−1 CV concentration. The degradation followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, with R2 close to 0.99. The catalytic activities were effectively retained after 10 reaction cycles, indicating the robust performance of IOZX. CONCLUSION: The key success of the current work was the formation of an IOZX catalyst derived from affordable and commonly available byproducts, leading to cost reductions and supporting sustainable practices. The synthesized catalyst could be further advanced and potentially applied for the remediation of cationic dye from aqueous solution. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline Agents; Crystal Violet; Heterogeneous Fenton-like; Iron Oxides/zeolite X Composite; Rice Husk Ash; Aluminum Oxide; Crystal Violet; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron Oxide; Silicon Dioxide; Sodium Hydroxide; Alkalinity; Bioremediation; Catalyst Activity; Catalyst Supports; Catalytic Oxidation; Chemical Industry; Concrete Construction; Cost Reduction; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Salt Removal; Alkaline Agent; Alkalines; Crystal Violet; Fenton Likes; Heterogeneous Fenton; Heterogeneous Fenton-like; Iron Oxide/zeolite X Composite; Rice-husk Ash; Zeolite X; ]+ Catalyst; Sodium Hydroxide; Aluminum Oxide; Crystal Violet; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron Oxide; Iron Salt; Silicon Dioxide; Sodium Hydroxide; Zeolite; Adsorption; Article; Ash; Catalysis; Catalyst; Chemical Composition; Chemical Reaction Kinetics; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Degradation; Fenton Reaction; Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Ion Exchange; Kinetics; Mass; Ph; Physical Chemistry; Pore Size; Pore Volume; Rice Husk; Room Temperature; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Surface Area; Synthesis; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction","Alkalinity; Bioremediation; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical industry; Concrete construction; Cost reduction; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Salt removal; Alkaline agent; Alkalines; Crystal violet; Fenton likes; Heterogeneous fenton; Heterogeneous fenton-like; Iron oxide/zeolite X composite; Rice-husk ash; Zeolite X; ]+ catalyst; Sodium hydroxide; aluminum oxide; crystal violet; hydrogen peroxide; iron oxide; iron salt; silicon dioxide; sodium hydroxide; zeolite; adsorption; Article; ash; catalysis; catalyst; chemical composition; chemical reaction kinetics; comparative study; controlled study; degradation; Fenton reaction; field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; ion exchange; kinetics; mass; pH; physical chemistry; pore size; pore volume; rice husk; room temperature; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction","","aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; crystal violet, 467-63-0, 548-62-9; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; iron oxide, 1332-37-2; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2","","Valizadeh, Kamran, Magnetized inulin by Fe3O4 as a bio-nano adsorbent for treating water contaminated with methyl orange and crystal violet dyes, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Shinde, Rohit Shankar, Study of Fe3O4 and Cu2+ doped modified Fe3O4 nano catalyst for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and eriochrome black-T dyes: Synthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial assessment, Inorganic Chemistry Communications, 170, (2024); Yan, Tong, A highly efficient Co-based catalyst for peroxymonosulfate activation for rapid degradation of RhB over a wide pH range, Inorganic Chemistry Communications, 170, (2024); Sun, Pengfei, Efficient removal of crystal violet using Fe3O4-coated biochar: The role of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and modeling study their adsorption behavior, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Chen, Chiingchang, Degradation of crystal violet by an FeGAC/H 2O 2 process, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 196, pp. 420-425, (2011); Liang, Huan, Diatomite coated with Fe2O3 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for degradation of organic pollutant, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers, 49, pp. 105-112, (2015); Ghasemi, Homa, Decolorization of wastewater by heterogeneous Fenton reaction using MnO2-Fe3O4/CuO hybrid catalysts, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 9, 2, (2021); Vu, Anh Tuan, Preparation of mesoporous Fe2O3·SiO2 composite from rice husk as an efficient heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst for degradation of organic dyes, Journal of Water Process Engineering, 28, pp. 169-180, (2019); Le, Van Thuan, Efficient photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet under natural sunlight using Fe3O4/ZnO nanoparticles embedded carboxylate-rich carbon, Materials Letters, 283, (2021); Abdelrahman, Ehab A., Facile synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticles from Egyptian insecticide cans for efficient photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and crystal violet dyes, Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy, 222, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10974660; 02682575","","JCTBD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001816194"

This study addresses the critical challenge posed by used PVDF/TiO<inf>2</inf> photocatalysts, which, if not properly managed, contribute to environmental pollution. A practical recovery technique based on the phase inversion method was developed to separate and purify PVDF, TiO<inf>2</inf>, and the solvent NMP from used composite materials. This method led to recovery rates of 95.17% for PVDF, 98.35% for NMP, and 67% for TiO<inf>2</inf>. The recycled photocatalyst was then reassembled and tested for its ability to degrade methylene blue, a common dye pollutant. A Box–Behnken design was employed to optimize the treatment conditions, ensuring the process was both efficient and reproducible. The regenerated material achieved up to 99.6% efficiency in the first cycle, with a slight reduction in efficiency observed across subsequent cycles, maintaining over 92% efficiency after 10 cycles. These findings confirm that effective recovery of photocatalytic materials is not only feasible but also beneficial in reducing waste and maintaining high treatment performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Photocatalyst Recovery; Pvdf/tio2 Composite; Recycling Process; Sustainable Photocatalysis; Ii-vi Semiconductors; Metamaterials; Photocatalytic Activity; Water Recycling; Environmental Concerns; Methylene Blue Degradations; P.v.d.f; Photocatalyst Recovery; Pvdf/tio2 Composite; Recycling Process; Reuse; Sustainable Photocatalysis; Sustainable Solution; Tio 2; Wastewater Reclamation","II-VI semiconductors; Metamaterials; Photocatalytic activity; Water recycling; Environmental concerns; Methylene blue degradations; P.V.D.F; Photocatalyst recovery; PVDF/TiO2 composite; Recycling process; Reuse; Sustainable photocatalysis; Sustainable solution; TiO 2; Wastewater reclamation","","","","Kesari, K.

Moreover, existing linear economy has also worsened status of plastic pollution. Thus, controlling plastic pollution and transitioning from linear economy to circular economy are becoming urgent. Municipal solid waste management plays a fundamental role in plastic pollution control and transition to circular economy. This study aimed at understanding status of plastic leakage and clarifying reversed logistic system in Danang city, Vietnam. The waste flow diagram (WFD) and material flow analysis (MFA) based on principle of mass balance were applied in this study. Yearly unmanaged plastic waste was estimated at 2198 tonnes. The amount of plastic waste leaked into aquatic environment was estimated at 0.99 kg/cap/year. Majority of unmanaged plastic waste mainly originated from uncollected waste (78.05% of total unmanaged plastic waste) and collection service (21.36% of total unmanaged plastic waste). Regarding informal reversed logistic system, itinerant buyers and waste pickers considerably contributed to recyclable waste recovery, collecting with about 69.34 tonnes (79.32% of total recovered recyclable waste) of recyclable material on a daily basis. Despite potential for circulation, other types of recyclable waste — glass, textile and leather, wood, as well as rubber — have not been widely collected for recovery. Results of this study offer scientific base for managers, policymakers, decision makers and related stakeholders of solid waste management system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular Economy; Informal Sector; Material Flow Analysis (mfa); Vietnam; Waste Flow Diagram (wfd); Bioremediation; Energy Conservation; Land Fill; Plastic Recycling; Wood Wastes; Circular Economy; Informal Sector; Material Flow Analyze; Materials Flow Analysis; Plastic Pollutions; Plastics Waste; Recyclable Wastes; Viet Nam; Waste Flow Diagram; Waste Flow Diagrams; Municipal Solid Waste","Bioremediation; Energy conservation; Land fill; Plastic recycling; Wood wastes; Circular economy; Informal sector; Material flow analyze; Materials flow analysis; Plastic pollutions; Plastics waste; Recyclable wastes; Viet Nam; Waste flow diagram; Waste flow diagrams; Municipal solid waste","","","The authors would like to be grateful to Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) for offering scholarship to first author.

This study explores 20 two-dimensional Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterobilayers for efficient water splitting. Using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we screen them based on band gaps and intrinsic electric fields to identify promising candidates, then further assess carrier mobility and surface chemistry to fully evaluate their overall performance. By examining the alignment of synthetic and internal electric fields, we distinguish between Type-I, Type-II, and Z-scheme configurations, enabling the targeted design of optimal photocatalytic materials. Furthermore, we employ the Fröhlich interaction model to quantify the mobility contributions from the longitudinal optical phonon mode, providing detailed insights into how carrier mobility, influenced by phonon scattering, affects photocatalytic performance.

This phenomenon has garnered attention for its potential to enable energy-efficient spintronic devices, such as SOT magnetic random-access memory. In this study, a high-quality RuO<inf>2</inf> (100) epitaxial film with a well-controlled triple-domain-structure is analyzed, and it is confirmed that out-of-plane spin-current generation is independent of the Néel vector ((Formula presented.)). This (Formula presented.) independence of the out-of-plane spin current leads to equal SOT values for the two orthogonal currents. The spin-split effect-induced SOT demonstrates a field-like (FL) torque efficiency (−0.066 ± 0.001) that is six times higher than that of the Slonczewski-like torque efficiency (−0.011 ± 0.001). Furthermore, micromagnetic simulations show that this high FL torque reduces the critical switching voltage by a factor of 2.6 in the sub-nanosecond regime in an SOT device. These findings contribute to advancing research and the development of highly energy-efficient antiferromagnetic-based SOT magnetic random-access memory. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Altermagnet Ruo2; Field-like Torque; Magnetic Random-access Memory; Spin-orbit Torque; Spin-split Effect; Antiferromagnetism; Magnetic Domains; Magnetic Film Storage; Magnetic Recording; Random Access Storage; Ruthenium Compounds; Spin Dynamics; Spintronics; Altermagnet Ruo2; Current Generation; Energy Efficient; Field-like Torque; Magnetic Random Access Memory; Ruo 2; Spin Currents; Spin Orbits; Spin-orbit Torque; Spin-split Effect; Anisotropy; Article; Electric Potential; Energy; Epitaxy; Human; Memory; Orbit Score; Simulation; Torque","Antiferromagnetism; Magnetic domains; Magnetic film storage; Magnetic recording; Random access storage; Ruthenium compounds; Spin dynamics; Spintronics; Altermagnet RuO2; Current generation; Energy efficient; Field-like torque; Magnetic random access memory; RuO 2; Spin currents; Spin orbits; Spin-orbit torque; Spin-split effect; Anisotropy; article; electric potential; energy; epitaxy; human; memory; ORBIT score; simulation; torque","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge Prof. Shunsuke Fukami, and Prof. Kohei Fujiwara for their support and constructive discussion.

The fiber porosity was controlled by adjusting the ratio of good solvents to nonsolvent in the spinning solution. The morphology and physical properties of the PLA fibers were systematically analyzed.

This study introduces for the first time a sustainable fabrication of porous carbon from Kraft lignin using K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> as an environment-friendly activator via a spray drying approach and carbonization process. K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> offers a low-toxic, low-corrosive, and eco-friendly alternative to KOH, making it safer for long-term equipment use and more suitable for large-scale applications. Furthermore, K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> effectively creates a microporous structure for CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption while simplifying waste management due to its benign and recyclable carbonate residues. Unlike conventional two-step activation, our approach integrates carbonization and activation into a single step, reducing production time and enhancing efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications. Porous carbon materials obtained through this novel process exhibited a CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption capacity of 4.54 mmol/g at 298 K, comparable to those activated with KOH and outperforming many previously reported adsorbents. Additionally, the effects of K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> concentration and carbonization temperature were systematically studied to optimize CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption performance.

Moreover, the adsorption performance of composites, treated SCB, and MPs for crystal violet (CV) was evaluated. Cellulose fibers were firstly isolated from SCB with a two-step process and employed as a matrix material to randomly adhere MPs via an in situ chemical co-precipitation method at room temperature. The properties of the composite were determined through analysis methods such as X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX/SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). Magnetization, surface area, and pore diameter of magnetic fiber composite were 11.1 emu/g, 20 m2/g, and 0.002 cm3/g, respectively. The characteristic peaks of cellulose and MPs were found in XRD results, whereas the Fe content in composite was 27.52%. FTIR spectra also exposed the characteristic functional groups of MPs and treated SCB. Additionally, the CV removal using composites was evaluated with the adsorption efficiency and capacity of 72.09% and 77.22 mg/g, respectively, at pH 7, an adsorbent dose of 2 g/L, a CV concentration of 150 mg/L within 30 min. The adsorption process corresponded to the Sips model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Besides, the mechanism of CV adsorption was primarily characterized by heterogeneous adsorption on the surface and physical sorption. In short, the obtained composite was a promising adsorbent for treating the dye-containing wastewater. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Crystal Violet; Magnetic Nanoparticles; The Sips Isotherm Model; Treated Sugarcane Bagasse","","","","","Abilio, Thais Eduarda, Hexavalent chromium removal from water: adsorption properties of in natura and magnetic nanomodified sugarcane bagasse, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 19, pp. 24816-24829, (2021); Alizadeh, Nina, Adsorption of Crystal Violet and Methylene Blue on Azolla and Fig Leaves Modified with Magnetite Iron Oxide Nanoparticles, International Journal of Environmental Research, 11, 2, pp. 197-206, (2017); Al-Shehri, Hamza S., Effective adsorption of crystal violet from aqueous solutions with effective adsorbent: equilibrium, mechanism studies and modeling analysis, Environmental Pollutants and Bioavailability, 33, 1, pp. 214-226, (2021); Amiralian, Nasim, Magnetic nanocellulose: A potential material for removal of dye from water, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 394, (2020); Bazzo, Alexandre, Avocado seed powder: characterization and its application for crystal violet dye removal from aqueous solutions, Desalination and Water Treatment, 57, 34, pp. 15873-15888, (2016); Biotechnol Res Int, (2014); Buthiyappan, Archina, Synthesis of iron oxides impregnated green adsorbent from sugarcane bagasse: Characterization and evaluation of adsorption efficiency, Journal of Environmental Management, 249, (2019); Chen, Ying, Synthesis of magnetic carboxymethyl cellulose/graphene oxide nanocomposites for adsorption of copper from aqueous solution, International Journal of Energy Research, 45, 3, pp. 3988-3998, (2021); Dai, Hongjie, Green and facile fabrication of pineapple peel cellulose/magnetic diatomite hydrogels in ionic liquid for methylene blue adsorption, Cellulose, 26, 6, pp. 3825-3844, (2019); Dang, Baokang, Preparation of high mechanical performance nano-Fe3O4/wood fiber binderless composite boards for electromagnetic absorption via a facile and green method, Nanomaterials, 8, 1, (2018)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","03666352","","CHPAE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217672339"

In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial potential and chemical diversity of crude extracts from actinobacterial strains isolated from mangrove sediments collected in Chonburi and Chachoengsao provinces of Thailand. Taxonomic identification confirmed that these isolates belong to the genus Streptomyces. Notably, ten isolates, identified as Streptomyces iranensis, Streptomyces yogyakartensis, Streptomyces cacaoi, Streptomyces ardesiacus, Streptomyces phaeoluteichromatogenes, and Streptomyces albiaxialis, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum K1 at concentrations <10 μg/mL. Among these, only S. albiaxialis displayed anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 viral protein R (HIV-1 Vpr) activity in HeLa cells harboring the TREx plasmid encoding full-length Vpr (TREx-HeLa-Vpr cells). MS/MS-guided molecular networking analysis highlighted the metabolic complexity of the isolates, revealing a diverse array of distinct compounds. These included chymostatin B, geldanamycin, dehydroxynocardamine, ikarugamycin epoxide, kanchanamycin C, glochidone, bisucaberin, coproporphyrin III, futalosine, and various siderophores such as ferrioxamine B, desferrioxamine D2, desferrioxamine G, desferrioxamine E, desferrioxamine, desferrioxamine H, and ferrioxamine E. Moreover, guided by the potent antimalarial activity of strain S2-SC19, the compound elaiophylin was detected, isolated, and identified using analytical techniques. Remarkably, the compound exhibited potent antimalarial activity with an IC<inf>50</inf> value of 0.002 ± 0.002 μg/mL against P. falciparum K1. Furthermore, genomic analysis revealed that strain S2-SC19 is most closely related to Streptomyces asiaticus DSM no. 41761.

This paper proposes a novel algorithm for human emotion detection using a hybrid paradigm of convolutional neural networks and a boosting model. The proposed algorithm employs two subsets of 18 and 14 features extracted from four sub-bands using discrete wavelet transform. These features are identified as the optimal subsets of the most relevant, among 42 original input features extracted from two subsets of 8 and 6 productive channels using a dual genetic algorithm combined with a wise-subject 5-fold cross validation procedure in which the first and second genetic algorithms address the efficient channels and optimal feature subsets. The feature subsets are estimated by differently intelligent models and wise-subject 5-fold cross validation procedure on the validation set. The proposed algorithm produces an accuracy of 70.43%/76.05%, precision of 69.88%/74.57%, recall of 98.70%/99.17%, and F1 score of 81.83%/85.13% for valence/arousal classifications, which suggest that the frontal and left regions of the cortex associate especially to human emotions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bio-signal Processing; Deep Learning; Electroencephalogram; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning; Wavelet Transform; Adaptive Boosting; Deep Learning; Discrete Wavelet Transforms; Intelligent Systems; Biosignal Processing; Cross Validation; Discrete-wavelet-transform; Emotion Recognition; Feature Subset; Human Emotion; Hybrid Intelligent Method; Machine-learning; Wavelets Transform; Convolutional Neural Networks","Adaptive boosting; Deep learning; Discrete wavelet transforms; Intelligent systems; Biosignal processing; Cross validation; Discrete-wavelet-transform; Emotion recognition; Feature subset; Human emotion; Hybrid intelligent method; Machine-learning; Wavelets transform; Convolutional neural networks","","","","Khare, Smith K., Emotion recognition and artificial intelligence: A systematic review (2014–2023) and research recommendations, Information Fusion, 102, (2024); Lin, Xuefen, EEG emotion recognition using improved graph neural network with channel selection, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 231, (2023); Wang, Xiaohu, Deep learning-based EEG emotion recognition: Current trends and future perspectives, Frontiers in Psychology, 14, (2023); Nandini, Durgesh, Design of subject independent 3D VAD emotion detection system using EEG signals and machine learning algorithms, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 85, (2023); Hassouneh, Aya, Development of a Real-Time Emotion Recognition System Using Facial Expressions and EEG based on machine learning and deep neural network methods, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 20, (2020); Prabowo, D.

For further decreasing aerodynamic drag, groove cavities made on the boattail region show a high potential technique. In this study, the geometry of longitudinal groove cavities was considered to understand its effect on the drag of the model. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to predict the total drag to find the configuration with minimum drag. For that purpose, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes with a k-ω shear stress transport model is used for the simulation. To generate data for the ANN, an automatic program was developed to create the model geometry, build the mesh, and conduct the calculation. The computational results were validated by experiments with the same flow conditions. The results show that for the baseline cases, the drag decreases with boattail angles to 14°, then, it increases again. However, by changing the geometry of longitudinal grooves, the aerodynamic drag decreases for boattail angles up to 20° with a maximum drag reduction of 34% in comparison to the blunt-based model. The mechanism of the drag reduction is due to the modification of the surface flow from a full separation for the baseline case to an attached flow with small local separation bubbles when the groove cavities were made. The pressure is found to significantly increase in the second-half region of boattail models with fully separated when the cavities were added. However, for boattail angles below 14°, the pressure distribution at the rear part of the boattail remains similar for models with grooves. The ANN results present that the drag of the model can be predicted well with an averaged uncertainty less than 2%. A groove configuration with the minimum drag and its aerodynamic characteristics are presented. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamic Configurations; Aerodynamic Drag; Computational Geometry; Navier Stokes Equations; Reynolds Number; Shear Stress; Stress Analysis; % Reductions; Afterbody; Axisymmetric Modeling; High Potential; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Passive Devices; Potential Techniques; Reynolds - Averaged Navier-stokes; Total Drags; Drag Reduction","Aerodynamic configurations; Aerodynamic drag; Computational geometry; Navier Stokes equations; Reynolds number; Shear stress; Stress analysis; % reductions; Afterbody; Axisymmetric modeling; High potential; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Passive devices; Potential techniques; Reynolds - Averaged Navier-Stokes; Total drags; Drag reduction","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant No. 107.03-2021.52.","Mair Wa, REDUCTION OF BASE DRAG BY BOAT-TAILED AFTERBODIES IN LOW- SPEED FLOW, Aeronautical Quarterly, 20, pt 4, pp. 307-320, (1969); Viswanath, P.

However, BC’s high rigidity, when dehydrated, limits its utility in diverse industries such as fashion and healthcare. This study aims to overcome these limitations by a sustainable modification approach of dehydrated BC derived from Acetobacter xylinum (commercially produced by Minh Tam Coconut Co., Ltd. – Vietnam) using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and electron beam irradiation (EBI), a cutting-edge, fast, chemical additive-free, and waterless technology, with various absorbed doses (0, 50, 100, and 200 kGy), to fabricate a BC-based interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). Consequently, at an absorbed dose of 200 kGy, the EBI-BC/PEG exhibits significant cross-linking effects, enhancing softness with a 17-fold reduction in bending modulus (166.3 ± 41.0 MPa), decreased flexural rigidity (49.2 ± 12.1 µNm), improved thermal conductivity with a threefold increase in maximum heat flux (0.256 ± 0.024 W/cm2), and increased areal density of bonded PEG (148.7 ± 21.5 g/m2) compared to untreated BC. Besides, tensile strength (26.1 ± 2.5 MPa), and strain percentage (4.5 ± 0.5%) of EBI-BC/PEG (200 kGy) decrease relative to unirradiated BC/PEG (0 kGy), these properties are still improved better when compared to untreated BC. Additionally, EBI-induced cross-linking improves thermal degradation temperature. Besides, EBI-induced oxidation enhances moisture regain and reduces the contact angle compared to unirradiated BC/PEG. This research provides foundational insights into BC modification by EBI to address current limitations, especially applying in textile and leather industries, promoting sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial Cellulose; Electron Beam Irradiation; Interpenetrating Polymer Network; Modification; Polyethylene Glycol; Sustainable; Crosslinking; Electron Beam Cutting; Textile Industry; Absorbed Dose; Bacterial Cellulose; Cross Linking; Electron Beam Irradiation; Interpenetrating Polymers; Modification; Nano-fibrous; Polymer Networks; Sustainable; Sustainable Materials; Rigidity; Cellulose; Cross Linking; Edges; Electrons; Polyethylene Glycol; Radiation Effects; Stiffness","Crosslinking; Electron beam cutting; Textile industry; Absorbed dose; Bacterial cellulose; Cross linking; Electron beam irradiation; Interpenetrating polymers; Modification; Nano-fibrous; Polymer networks; Sustainable; Sustainable materials; Rigidity; Cellulose; Cross Linking; Edges; Electrons; Polyethylene Glycol; Radiation Effects; Stiffness","","","","Sustainability in the Textile Industry, (2017); Bacterial Cellulose Sustainable Material for Textiles, (2021); Phan, Hung Ngoc, Fabrication and characterization of patterned leather-like biomaterial derived from Brazilein/Glycerol-finished Bacterial Cellulose by using 3-in-1 textile finishing process, Cellulose, 30, 8, pp. 5217-5237, (2023); Phan, Hung Ngoc, Textile finishing for bacterial cellulose modification: organic acid-catalyzed cellulosic acetylation, Journal of the Textile Institute, 116, 4, pp. 713-721, (2025); Sci Rep, (2024); Darwesh, Osama M., Application of microalgal-ZnO-NPs for reusing polyester/cotton blended fabric wastes after modification by cellulases enzymes, Waste Disposal and Sustainable Energy, 5, 4, pp. 471-482, (2023); Darwesh, Osama M., Natural dyes developed by microbial-nanosilver to produce antimicrobial and anticancer textiles, Microbial Cell Factories, 23, 1, (2024); An, Sung-jun, Preparation and characterization of resorbable bacterial cellulose membranes treated by electron beam irradiation for guided bone regeneration, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 18, 11, (2017); Phan, Hung Ngoc, Modification of dehydrated bacterial cellulose with glycerol and succinic acid by using padding method for textile applications, Research Journal of Textile and Apparel, 29, 2, pp. 371-388, (2025); Phan, Hung Ngoc, Fabrication of fabric-like Bacterial Cellulose/Collagen membranes by applying textile padding method for wound dressing applications, Cellulose, 30, 4, pp. 2289-2321, (2023)","","Korean Fiber Society","","","","","","12299197","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218245072"

Of the 56 boys and 34 girls (67% detection rate) in whom PER1 was detected, BMAL1 was detected in only 16 boys and 15 girls. Dioxin levels were significantly higher in girls with BMAL1 detection than in girls without detection. In girls, higher relative BMAL1 expression levels were associated with greater levels of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and toxic equivalents of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. Moreover, BMAL1 expression levels were correlated with shorter night sleep duration on weekdays, greater sleep duration on holidays, and higher hyperactivity scores. After adjusting for maternal parity, relative PER1 expression levels were higher in boys with higher toxic equivalents of polychlorinated dibenzofuran than those in girls. Although higher PER1 expression levels were correlated with greater verbal aggression and hostility scores in girls, no such associations were found in boys. These findings suggest the possible existence of sex-specific effects of perinatal dioxin exposure on circadian rhythms regulated by clock genes, particularly BMAL1, leading to sleep and behavioral problems in later life. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavior Problems; Circadian Rhythm; Clock Gene; Dioxin; Vietnam; Dioxin; Messenger Rna; Per1 Protein; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxin; Polychlorinated Dibenzofuran; Transcription Factor Arntl; Article; Child; Circadian Rhythm; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Level; Hostility; Human; Leisure; Male; Night Sleep; Parity; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; School Child; Sleep Time; Verbal Hostility; Viet Nam","dioxin; messenger RNA; PER1 protein; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; transcription factor ARNTL; Article; child; circadian rhythm; clinical article; controlled study; female; gene expression; gene expression level; hostility; human; leisure; male; night sleep; parity; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; school child; sleep time; verbal hostility; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Sports, Science and Culture, Japan; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (17H04665).","Statpearls, (2023); Patke, Alina, Molecular mechanisms and physiological importance of circadian rhythms, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, 21, 2, pp. 67-84, (2020); Organohalogen Compounds, (1999); Fader, Kelly A., 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin abolishes circadian regulation of hepatic metabolic activity in mice, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Mukai, Motoko, Behavioral rhythmicity of mice lacking AhR and attenuation of light-induced phase shift by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, Journal of Biological Rhythms, 23, 3, pp. 200-210, (2008); Tai, Pham The, Perinatal Dioxin Exposure and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptoms in Children Living in a Dioxin Contamination Hotspot in Vietnam, Toxics, 10, 5, (2022); Coogan, Andrew N., Circadian rhythms and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: The what, the when and the why, Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, 67, pp. 74-81, (2016); Bouteldja, Ahmed A., The circadian system: A neglected player in neurodevelopmental disorders, European Journal of Neuroscience, 60, 2, pp. 3858-3890, (2024); Mogavero, Floriana, Clock genes, ADHD and aggression, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 91, pp. 51-68, (2018); Bjarnason, G.

The reaction was investigated using a tandem micro-reactor connected to a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) system, encompassing both in-situ and ex-situ studies. Fe oxide/HY and Cu oxide/HY catalysts, prepared via a metal–organic framework (MOF)-incorporated technique, demonstrated excellent metal dispersion and enhanced electron density. The Cu oxide/HY catalyst showed significant production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, reaching up to 28% in in-situ studies. Owing to its strong acid sites, this catalyst facilitated the formation of aromatic compounds. In ex-situ studies, furan and acetaldehyde were consumed through the Diels–Alder reaction. The increase in aromatic compounds was highlighted by a synergistic effect percentage as high as 175%. The mechanism of aromatic formation was elucidated through dealkylation, Diels–Alder, and aromatization reactions. The Cu oxide/HY catalyst, combined with the MOF-incorporated preparation technique presents a promising system for catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and HDPE.

By employing state-of-the-art van der Waals (vdW) density functionals, the binding affinity of studied molecules, i.e., CH<inf>4</inf>, CO<inf>2</inf>, and H<inf>2</inf>O on MXene adsorbents is well described by more recent vdW functionals, i.e., SCAN-rvv10. Although both CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> are nonpolar molecules, on pristine and oxygen-vacancy surfaces, they show a different range of adsorption energies, in which CH<inf>4</inf> is more inert and has weaker binding than CO<inf>2</inf>. CO<inf>2</inf> stays intact in its molecular forms for most of the tested functionals, except for the case of the vdW-DF functional, where CO<inf>2</inf> exhibits a dissociation regardless of its initial adsorption geometry. For full surface terminations, the adsorption affinity of all involved species is comparable within the same range, varying from −0.10 to −0.20 eV, attributed to either weak dispersion interactions or hydrogen bonds. The binding of H<inf>2</inf>O is much more pronounced compared to CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> in the presence of oxygen vacancies with the highest adsorption energy of −1.33 eV, vs. −0.67, and −0.20 eV obtained for H<inf>2</inf>O, CO<inf>2</inf>, and CH<inf>4</inf> respectively. H<inf>2</inf>O can dissociate with a small activation energy barrier of 0.40 eV, much smaller than its molecular adsorption energy, to further saturate itself on the surface. At high oxygen-vacancy concentrations, stronger bindings of adsorbates are found due to a preferred attachment of adsorbates to induced undercoordinated metal sites.

The proposed controller is designed based on a hybrid of a nonlinear proportional integral derivative (NPID) control, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), and balancing composite motion optimization (BCMO). The hybrid NPID-RBFNN controller offers a light-weight computation, chattering-reduction, while providing high robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbance. Therefore, it provides excellent features to control ballbots against the counterpart approaches such as the conventional PID, conventional NPID, which preserves low robustness against disturbances, or sliding mode control (SMC), which provides higher chattering. The BCMO is used to determine the gain values that best fit the system, and RBFNN is learned continuously during the ballbot movement to balance the system in the most stable and smooth way. The NPID-RBFNN controller is proven to be stable through the Lyapunov approach. The simulation and experiment results show that the NPID-RBFNN controller is a robust method for controlling the ballbot system's motion in applications with external force. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Balancing Composite Motion Optimization; Ballbot; External Force; Nonlinear Pid Control; Radial Basis Function Neural Network","","","","This research was funded by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under project code VINIF.2023.DA089 .","Nguyen, Van Truong, Adaptive Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Tracking Control for Parallel Manipulators with Uncertainties, pp. 522-525, (2019); Nguyen, Van Truong, Non-Negative Adaptive Mechanism-Based Sliding Mode Control for Parallel Manipulators with Uncertainties, Computers, Materials and Continua, 74, 2, pp. 2771-2787, (2023); Nguyen, Van Truong, Adaptive Neural Network Hierarchical Sliding-Mode Control for Pendubot Based Genetic Algorithm Optimization, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 471 LNNS, pp. 574-580, (2022); IEEE ASME Trans Mechatron, (2024); Pham, Dinhba, Combined control with sliding mode and Partial feedback linearization for a spatial ridable ballbot, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 128, pp. 531-550, (2019); Ba Pham, Dinh, Balancing and Tracking Control of Ballbot Mobile Robots Using a Novel Synchronization Controller Along With Online System Identification, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 70, 1, pp. 657-668, (2023); Van Thach, Do, Neural Integral Backstepping Hierarchical Sliding Mode Control for a Ridable Ballbot under Uncertainties and Input Saturation, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 51, 11, pp. 7214-7227, (2021); Satici, Aykut Cihan, Intrinsic dynamics and total energy-shaping control of the ballbot system, International Journal of Control, 90, 12, pp. 2734-2747, (2017); Jin, Xin, Simulation of hydraulic transplanting robot control system based on fuzzy PID controller, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 164, (2020); Zhao, Baiyang, An adaptive PID control method to improve the power tracking performance of solar photovoltaic air-conditioning systems, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 113, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22150986","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210931376"

This research focused on combining poly (lactic acid) and chitosan varying concentrations in the presence of glutaraldehyde crosslinker after the centrifugal spinning process to fabricate a hydrophilic membrane for biomedical applications. The influences of chitosan on the resulting membrane's morphology and wettability were explored through scanning electron microscopy and contact angle analysis. The results showed that the concentration of chitosan affected the formation and the membrane morphology. The incorporation of chitosan led to an increase in fiber diameter and reduced the water contact angle of the fabricated membrane.

A green and straightforward synthesis for generating an iron oxide-grafted thiamin based adsorbents is developed. Their physicochemical and adsorption properties varied depending on the mixing ratio of ferrous chloride salt and thiamin. Adsorbents exhibited different magnetic properties owing to the presence of Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and γ-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> crystalline phases. Their surface charges of iron oxide and functionalized thiamin-adsorbents were 25 mV and 30–52.3 mV, respectively while the C and N contents of thiamin ranged from 3.87–14.5% and 3.95–8.15% at different mixing ratios. Besides, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to analyze the morphology and thermal stability of adsorbents, respectively. This work investigated the effect of thiamin content in the material composition-based iron oxide on the adsorption capacity of anionic dyes. At the optimal condition (pH 5, an adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L, and a 30 mg/L concentration), the MO adsorption efficiency reached 77.56% in 30 min. Meanwhile, a 93.83% EBT was removed at pH 7, an adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L, and a 90 mg/L concentration at the same time. The adsorption mechanism follows the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo second-order (PSO) kinetic model. The adsorption processes are spontaneous and exothermic. The characteristic vibrations of functional groups of adsorbents were identified via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). After four cycles, adsorbents could be employed albeit with a lower efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Eriochrome Black T; Functionalization; Iron Oxide/thiamin; Methyl Orange; Surface Modification; Adsorbents; Adsorption Isotherms; Air Quality; Atomic Emission Spectroscopy; Bioremediation; Gas Adsorption; Grafting (chemical); Iron Removal (water Treatment); Thermogravimetric Analysis; Adsorbent Dosage; Eriochrome Black T; Functionalizations; Hazardous Organics; Iron Oxide/thiamin; Magnetic Iron Oxides; Methyl Orange; Mixing Ratios; Organic Contaminant; Surface-modification; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy","Adsorbents; Adsorption isotherms; Air quality; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Bioremediation; Gas adsorption; Grafting (chemical); Iron removal (water treatment); Thermogravimetric analysis; Adsorbent dosage; Eriochrome black T; Functionalizations; Hazardous organics; Iron oxide/thiamin; Magnetic iron oxides; Methyl Orange; Mixing ratios; Organic contaminant; Surface-modification; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","","","","Angkawijaya, Artik Elisa, Studies on the performance of functionalized Fe3O4 as phosphate adsorbent and assessment to its environmental compatibility, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers, 131, (2022); Anirudhan, Thayyath Sreenivasan, Adsorptive removal of basic dyes from aqueous solutions by surfactant modified bentonite clay (organoclay): Kinetic and competitive adsorption isotherm, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 95, pp. 215-225, (2015); Ben Arfi, Rim, Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-treated Phragmites australis powder as novel polymeric adsorbent for hazardous Eriochrome Black T removal from aqueous solutions, Polymer Bulletin, 76, 10, pp. 5077-5102, (2019); Sivaranjani, A., Fabrication of γ-Fe2O3 Nanowires from Abundant and Low-cost Fe Plate for Highly Effective Electrocatalytic Water Splitting, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Attallah, Olivia A., Removal of cationic and anionic dyes from aqueous solution with magnetite/pectin and magnetite/silica/pectin hybrid nanocomposites: Kinetic, isotherm and mechanism analysis, RSC Advances, 6, 14, pp. 11461-11480, (2016); Azam, Kshaf, Development of recoverable magnetic mesoporous carbon adsorbent for removal of methyl blue and methyl orange from wastewater, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 8, 5, (2020); Aziz, El Kassimi, Adsorptive removal of anionic dye from aqueous solutions using powdered and calcined vegetables wastes as low-cost adsorbent, Arab Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences, 25, 3, pp. 93-102, (2018); Bahrudin, Noor Nazihah, Adsorption Characteristics and Mechanistic Study of Immobilized Chitosan-Montmorillonite Composite for Methyl Orange removal, Journal of Polymers and the Environment, 28, 7, pp. 1901-1913, (2020); Barcelos, Karina Almeida, PEG-Iron Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles: In situ Synthesis and In vitro Biocompatibility Evaluation for Potential T2-MRI Applications, BioNanoScience, 10, 4, pp. 1107-1120, (2020); Chatterjee, Sobhan, Selective and Recyclable Congo Red Dye Adsorption by Spherical Fe3O4 Nanoparticles Functionalized with 1,2,4,5-Benzenetetracarboxylic Acid, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","15635201; 00986445","","CEGCA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001257082"

Therefore, we investigated mechanisms underlying PHA production from non-edible resources by Piscinibacter gummiphilus strain NS21T. Strain NS21T can utilize natural rubber as a carbon source on solid media and potentially produces PHA. Gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of NS21T cell extracts revealed the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) from natural rubber and glucose, respectively. Transcriptional analysis suggested that phaC is involved in PHA production. An increased PHBV accumulation rate under nitrogen-limiting conditions indicates the potential of this strain to be used as a PHBV production enhancement strategy. Furthermore, the disruption of PHA depolymerase genes resulted in enhanced PHA production, indicating the involvement of these genes in PHA degradation. These findings highlight the potential of NS21T for PHBV production from natural rubber, a non-edible resource. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deproteinized Natural Rubber; Nitrogen-limitation Strategy; Pha Depolymerase Gene; Piscinibacter Gummiphilus Ns21t; Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) Production; Glucose; Nitrogen; Rubber; Polyesters; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Rubber; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Transcription; Depolymerase Genes; Deproteinized Natural Rubber; Nitrogen Limitation; Nitrogen-limitation Strategy; Piscinibacte Gummiphilus Ns21t; Poly(-3-hydroxyalkanoate); Poly(3 Hydroxyalkanoate); Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) Depolymerase Gene; Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) Production; Poly-3--hydroxyalkanoate; Gas Chromatography; Cell Extract; Chemical Compound; Ester Derivative; Glucose; Nitrogen; Poly(3 Hydroxyalkanoate)polymerase; Poly(3 Hydroxybutyrate Co 3 Hydroxyvalerate); Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthase; Rubber; Unclassified Drug; Polyester; Polyhydroxyalkanoic Acid; Article; Bacterium; Carbon Source; Comparative Study; Degradation; Gas Chromatography; Gene; Genetic Modification; Genetic Transcription; Nonhuman; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Piscinibacter Gummiphilus Strain Ns21; Poly(3 Hydroxyalkanoate) Depolymerase Gene; Solid; X Ray Diffraction; Polyesters; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Rubber","Nuclear magnetic resonance; Transcription; Depolymerase genes; Deproteinized natural rubber; Nitrogen limitation; Nitrogen-limitation strategy; Piscinibacte gummiphilus ns21T; Poly(-3-hydroxyalkanoate); Poly(3 hydroxyalkanoate); Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) depolymerase gene; Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) production; Poly-3--hydroxyalkanoate; Gas chromatography; cell extract; chemical compound; ester derivative; glucose; nitrogen; poly(3 hydroxyalkanoate)polymerase; poly(3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate); polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase; rubber; unclassified drug; polyester; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; Article; bacterium; carbon source; comparative study; degradation; gas chromatography; gene; genetic modification; genetic transcription; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; Piscinibacter gummiphilus strain ns21; poly(3 hydroxyalkanoate) depolymerase gene; solid; X ray diffraction; Polyesters; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Rubber","","glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; rubber, 9006-04-6; Polyesters; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Rubber","This work was supported by JST-Mirai Program Grant Number JPMJMI19E6 from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and by KAKENHI Grant Number 24K03115 from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan.

The previous single-material diffusion bonded loop heat pipes were made of copper, leading to a high heat leak due to high thermal conductivity, causing a reduction in efficiency. This research used a new approach that separated the evaporator from the loop heat pipe while using diffusion bonding to manufacture a loop heat pipe using two materials, copper and stainless steel. This separation allowed for lower thermal conductivity materials to be used to help reduce the heat leak. Two evaporators with different wicks were tested, one made of copper and the other made of polytetrafluoroethylene. Both designs were tested in multiple orientations and operated for a range of 15 W to 45 W with an evaporator to condenser thermal resistance ranging from 2.18 °C/W to 0.004 °C/W. Additionally, a numerical model was developed to predict the performance of both evaporators, with an average temperature difference ranging from 5.5 °C to 6.6 °C for all thermocouple locations. The heat leak ratio was analyzed using the model, and a heat leak ratio of 7.6% to 8.0% and 13.6% to 16.0% for the copper wick and polytetrafluoroethylene wick loop heat pipe was calculated, respectively. This research demonstrates that diffusion bonding copper with a lower thermal conductivity material and using low thermal conductivity sealing material can help reduce the heat leak within diffusion bonded loop heat pipes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heat Pipes; Heat Resistance; Sealing (finishing); Thermal Conductivity Of Solids; Thermocouples; % Reductions; Experimental Investigations; Heat Leaks; High Thermal Conductivity; Loop Heat Pipe; Low Thermal Conductivity; Manufacturing Techniques; Numerical Investigations; Property; Thermal; Diffusion Bonding","Heat pipes; Heat resistance; Sealing (finishing); Thermal conductivity of solids; Thermocouples; % reductions; Experimental investigations; Heat leaks; High thermal conductivity; Loop Heat Pipe; Low thermal conductivity; Manufacturing techniques; Numerical investigations; Property; Thermal; Diffusion bonding","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [Grant Number 23H00211].","Koengkan, Matheus, The Impact of Battery-Electric Vehicles on Energy Consumption: A Macroeconomic Evidence from 29 European Countries, World Electric Vehicle Journal, 13, 2, (2022); Dong, Xue, CO2 emission of electric and gasoline vehicles under various road conditions for China, Japan, Europe and world average-prediction through year 2040, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 9, 11, (2019); Canals Casals, Lluc, Sustainability analysis of the electric vehicle use in Europe for CO2 emissions reduction, Journal of Cleaner Production, 127, pp. 425-437, (2016); Li, Lifu, Acceleration curve optimization for electric vehicle based on energy consumption and battery life, Energy, 169, pp. 1039-1053, (2019); Okamoto, Atsushi, On-orbit Experiment Plan of Loop Heat Pipe and the Test Results of Ground Test, Microgravity Science and Technology, 31, 3, pp. 327-337, (2019); Wang, Xianling, Visualization study of a flat confined loop heat pipe for electronic devices cooling, Applied Energy, 322, (2022); Zhao, Xudong, Theoretical investigation of the performance of a novel loop heat pipe solar water heating system for use in Beijing, China, Applied Thermal Engineering, 30, 16, pp. 2526-2536, (2010); Huang, Bin Juine, Low-cost manufacturing of loop heat pipe for commercial applications, Applied Thermal Engineering, 126, pp. 1091-1097, (2017); Aono, Yoshitada, Development of a loop heat pipe with kW-class heat transport capability, Applied Thermal Engineering, 183, (2021); Wu, Tong, Experimental investigation on the start-up performance of a loop heat pipe with three flat disk evaporators combined, Applied Thermal Engineering, 216, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","13594311","","ATENF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205148999"

However, the low cycle efficiency and poor rate capacity of cathode materials have hindered the commercialization of SIBs, prompting extensive research efforts to address these challenges. Ion doping into the material structure is considered to be an effective, simple, and scalable approach to enhancing the electrical performance of cathode materials. In this work, B and F elemental ions were selectively doped into the structure of sodium-lithium-manganese-cobalt oxide material via the sol-gel method combined with calcination. The effects of B and F ion doping on the properties of the obtained materials exhibited distinct variations, particularly in the electrochemical performance. While the B-doped material (B-NLMC) exhibited a specific capacity of up to 166.5 mAh g-1 at a current density of 10 mA g-1 and maintained 72.1% capacity after 100 cycles, the material simultaneously doped with B and F ions (BF-NLMC) demonstrated lower specific capacity and cycling efficiency compared to B-NLMC. However, the BF-NLMC material exhibited significantly improved rate capability, delivering a specific capacity of up to approximately 80 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 200 mA g-1. Obviously, this research offers valuable insights into diversifying doping strategies to enhance the electrochemical performance of cathode materials, contributing to the advancement of SIB technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number NCUD.01-2022.03.","Hwang, Jang–Yeon, Sodium-ion batteries: Present and future, Chemical Society Reviews, 46, 12, pp. 3529-3614, (2017); Wu, Xiaoyu, Understanding rechargeable magnesium ion batteries via first-principles computations: A comprehensive review, Energy Storage Materials, 48, pp. 344-355, (2022); Fan, Lixin, Recent development of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies: A review, Energy Reports, 7, pp. 8421-8446, (2021); Nazir, Ghazanfar, A Review of Rechargeable Zinc–Air Batteries: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives, Nano-Micro Letters, 16, 1, (2024); He, Mingyi, Review of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, Progress in Solid State Chemistry, 74, (2024); Park, Hyunyoung, Review on Cathode Materials for Sodium- and Potassium-Ion Batteries: Structural Design with Electrochemical Properties, Batteries and Supercaps, 6, 3, (2023); Jin, Ting, Realizing Complete Solid-Solution Reaction in High Sodium Content P2-Type Cathode for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 59, 34, pp. 14511-14516, (2020); Delmas, Claude, Structural classification and properties of the layered oxides, Physica B: Physics of Condensed Matter & C: Atomic, Molecular and Plasma Physics, Optics, 99, 1-4, pp. 81-85, (1980); Wang, Peng Fei, Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium-Ion Batteries: Phase Transition, Air Stability, and Performance, Advanced Energy Materials, 8, 8, (2018); Komaba, Shinichi, Study on the reversible electrode reaction of Na 1-xNi 0.5Mn 0.5O 2 for a rechargeable sodium-ion battery, Inorganic Chemistry, 51, 11, pp. 6211-6220, (2012)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","24701343","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209066755"

This paper presents a methodology for designing demand response (DR) programs while mitigating the negative impacts. The DR programs require the retailers to set target electricity consumption and prices of economic incentives for customers who cooperate with the DR programs. First, the target electricity consumption is determined by solving a problem of social welfare maximization in which the objective function is the sum of economic surplus of the retailers and their customers and impacts of electricity imbalance. The optimal electricity prices or the optimal rebate levels are then calculated under the principle that rational customers act to maximize their economic surplus. Through numerical simulations, the authors confirmed that the proposed methodology mitigated the impacts of electricity imbalance. Meanwhile, results of the numerical simulations showed that in practical situations, there were cases where the retailers unable to reduce the electricity imbalance profitably. Therefore, the authors additionally discuss ways to assess the electricity imbalance, which motivates the retailers to reduce the imbalance, in such cases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Demand Response Programs; Electricity Prices; Imbalance Between Electricity Supply And Demand; Imbalance Prices; Rebate Levels; Social Welfare Maximization; Demand Response Programs; Economic Surplus; Electricity Prices; Electricity Supply And Demands; Electricity-consumption; Imbalance Between Electricity Supply And Demand; Imbalance Price; Rebate Level; Social Welfare Maximization; Theoretical Study; Demand Response","Demand response programs; Economic surplus; Electricity prices; Electricity supply and demands; Electricity-consumption; Imbalance between electricity supply and demand; Imbalance price; Rebate level; Social welfare maximization; Theoretical study; Demand response","","","","undefined, (2022); A Report to the United States Congress Pursuant to Chapter 1252 of the Energy Policy Act of, (2005); Hussain, Muhammad Sadam, A review of demand response in an efficient smart grid environment, Electricity Journal, 31, 5, pp. 55-63, (2018); Iqbal, Sana, A comprehensive review on residential demand side management strategies in smart grid environment, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 13, (2021); Nolan, Sheila, Challenges and barriers to demand response deployment and evaluation, Applied Energy, 152, pp. 1-10, (2015); Deng, Ruilong, A survey on demand response in smart grids: Mathematical models and approaches, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 11, 3, pp. 570-582, (2015); Siano, Pierluigi, Demand response and smart grids - A survey, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 30, pp. 461-478, (2014); Chai, Yanxin, Incentive-based demand response model for maximizing benefits of electricity retailers, Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy, 7, 6, pp. 1644-1650, (2019); Salkuti, Surender Reddy, Optimizing energy and demand response programs using multi-objective optimization, Electrical Engineering, 99, 1, pp. 397-406, (2017); Cai, Yao, Optimal scheduling of a hybrid AC/DC multi-energy microgrid considering uncertainties and Stackelberg game-based integrated demand response, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 142, (2022)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","30049261","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205683039"

As a result, the metal transfer frequency of solid wire was monotonically decreased with the CO<inf>2</inf> content owing to an increase in the arc pressure, which prevented droplet detachment. However, the metal transfer frequency of the metal-cored wire presented a maximum value at 15% CO<inf>2</inf> under all the current levels. The transfer behavior was supposed to depend on the relation between the arc attachment position and the tip of the unmelted flux position inside the cored wire. When the CO<inf>2</inf> concentration was low, the arc was attached higher than the unmelted flux, causing the electromagnetic force to be ineffective in droplet separation. When the CO<inf>2</inf> concentration increased slightly, the arc was moved downward to the tip of the unmelted flux. That tendency temporarily facilitated the neck formation at the wire tip due to enhanced electromagnetic force flowing through the molten metal on the wire tip. Nevertheless, when the CO<inf>2</inf> content increased over a critical value, the arc pressure became a dominant factor to hinder the droplet detachment, which caused a decrease in transfer frequency. Consequently, the metal transfer frequency of metal-cored wire became maximum at 15% CO<inf>2</inf>. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Current Path; Flux Column; Gas Composition; Metal Transfer; Metal-cored Arc Welding; Electromagnetic Shielding; Gas Metal Arc Welding; Gas Welding; Gases; Laser Beam Welding; Liquid Metals; Wire; Arc Pressure; Arc-welding; Current Paths; Flux Column; Gas Compositions; Metal Cored Wires; Metal Transfer Frequency; Metal Transfers; Metal-cored Arc Welding; Solid Wires; Carbon Dioxide","Electromagnetic shielding; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Gases; Laser beam welding; Liquid metals; Wire; Arc pressure; Arc-welding; Current paths; Flux column; Gas compositions; Metal cored wires; Metal transfer frequency; Metal transfers; Metal-cored arc welding; Solid wires; Carbon dioxide","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number JP21K04710), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.","Kah, Paul, Usability of arc types in industrial welding, International Journal of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, 9, 1, (2014); Lancaster, J.

However, these generators still face certain issues, such as neglecting substrate deformation energy, inability to store energy, and surface deterioration due to continuous impact of droplets, thus narrowing the scope of their potential applications. Here, a novel hydrovoltaic-piezoelectric hybridized device (HPeD) is reported that integrates hydrocapacitor, aluminum–air (Al–air) battery, and piezoelectric nanogenerator technologies through a green design strategy, which can effectively address the proposed problems. Impinged by a 40-μL water droplet, the HPeD yields a potential window of 1.54 V within approximately 1 min, further boosting to 1.86 V under external vertical pressure. The generated energy was greatly stored for up to 5.7 days. This all-solid-state device effectively inhibits electrolyte leakage during idle periods and controls reversible reactions to minimize corrosion, thereby extending its lifespan. Furthermore, the HPeD is successfully used as a piezoelectric nanogenerator/sensor that can operate continuously to detect external mechanical stimulus. In piezo sensor mode, the device demonstrated good sensitivity of 0.098 kPa−1 in the low-pressure range (0–8.2 kPa), a remarkable response/relaxation time of 0.3 s, and durability lasting over 8000 cycles. This study paves the way for the advancement of next-generation flexible hybrid devices capable of multifunctionality in both energy harvesting and sensing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybridized Device; Hydrovoltaic Capacitor; Piezoelectric; Sensor System; Solid-state Battery; Corrosion; Deterioration; Drops; Energy Harvesting; Nanotechnology; Piezoelectricity; Solid Electrolytes; Solid-state Batteries; Dual-energy; Energy; Hybridized Device; Hydrovoltaic Capacitor; Micro Droplets; Nanogenerators; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric Nanogenerator; Sensor Systems; Solid State Batteries; Solid State Devices","Corrosion; Deterioration; Drops; Energy harvesting; Nanotechnology; Piezoelectricity; Solid electrolytes; Solid-State Batteries; Dual-energy; Energy; Hybridized device; Hydrovoltaic capacitor; Micro droplets; Nanogenerators; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric nanogenerator; Sensor systems; Solid state batteries; Solid state devices","","","This work was supported in part by an appointment to the Fujian Minjiang Chair Professor Program (CN) [No 2022(04)] and Guiding Project of the Department of Science and Technology of Fujian Province (CN) under grant 2022H0048.","Shah, Arvind Victor, Photovoltaic technology: The case for thin-film solar cells, Science, 285, 5428, pp. 692-698, (1999); Liu, Ruhao, A photocapacitor based on organometal halide perovskite and PANI/CNT composites integrated using a CNT bridge, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 5, 44, pp. 23078-23084, (2017); Wang, Shuhua, Efficient Scavenging of Solar and Wind Energies in a Smart City, ACS Nano, 10, 6, pp. 5696-5700, (2016); Liu, Kang, Thermal–Electric Nanogenerator Based on the Electrokinetic Effect in Porous Carbon Film, Advanced Energy Materials, 8, 13, (2018); Lu, Shyi Min, A global review of enhanced geothermal system (EGS), Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 81, pp. 2902-2921, (2018); Fridleifsson, Ingvar Birgir, Geothermal energy for the benefit of the people, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 5, 3, pp. 299-312, (2001); Trung, Vuong Dinh, Compact Electrolytic Hydrocapacitor for Direct Harvesting and Storing Energy from Water Droplet Achieving High Voltage, Advanced Materials Technologies, 8, 19, (2023); Trung, Vuong Dinh, A Moisture-Induced Electric Generator with High Output Voltage for Self-Powered Wearable Electronics, ChemNanoMat, 8, 12, (2022); Trung, Vuong Dinh, An aluminum-air battery/hydrocapacitor-inspired hybrid device for energy conversion from micro water droplets, Chemical Engineering Journal, 480, (2024); Trung, Vuong Dinh, Recent developments in droplet-based devices, Materials Today Chemistry, 36, (2024)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199877750"

The immunostimulatory action of Hz has previously been applied in the development of alternative adjuvants. Crystallization of hemin is a chemical approach for producing Hz. Here, we focused on an enzymatic production method for Hz using the heme detoxification protein (HDP), which catalyzes heme dimer formation from hemin in Plasmodium. We examined the immunostimulatory effects of an enzymatically synthesized analog of Hz (esHz) produced by recombinant Plasmodium falciparum HDP. Enzymatically synthesized Hz stimulates a macrophage cell line and human peripheral mononuclear cells, leading to the production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12p40. In mice, subcutaneous administration of esHz together with an antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), increased the OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G2c isotype level in the serum, whereas OVA-specific IgG1 was not induced. Our findings suggest that esHz is a useful Th-1 cell adjuvant. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adjuvant; Heme Detoxification Protein; Hemozoin Analog; Th-1 Immunity; Vaccine","","","","Funding text 1: This work was conducted at the NIMS Molecule and Material Synthesis platform, supported by the Nanotechnology Platform Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Kakenhi grant number (17KK0122, 15K06589) and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) for the translational and clinical research core institutes under the Tsukuba Clinical Research & Development Organization (A18-58).","Higdon, Ashlee N., Hemin causes mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells through promoting lipid peroxidation: The protective role of autophagy, American Journal of Physiology - Heart and Circulatory Physiology, 302, 7, pp. H1394-H1409, (2012); Jani, Dewal, HDP - A novel heme detoxification protein from the malaria parasite, PLOS Pathogens, 4, 4, (2008); Soni, Awakash, Cloning, expression and functional characterization of heme detoxification protein (HDP) from the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium vinckei, Gene, 566, 1, pp. 109-119, (2015); Nakatani, Keisuke, Identification of essential histidine residues involved in heme binding and hemozoin formation in heme detoxification protein from plasmodium falciparum, Scientific Reports, 4, (2014); Nakatani, Keisuke, Heme-binding properties of heme detoxification protein from Plasmodium falciparum, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 439, 4, pp. 477-480, (2013); Coban, Cevayir, Immunogenicity of Whole-Parasite Vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum Involves Malarial Hemozoin and Host TLR9, Cell Host and Microbe, 7, 1, pp. 50-61, (2010); Coban, Cevayir, The malarial metabolite hemozoin and its potential use as a vaccine adjuvant, Allergology International, 59, 2, pp. 115-124, (2010); Griffith, Jason W., Pure hemozoin is inflammatory in vivo and activates the NALP3 inflammasome via release of uric acid, Journal of Immunology, 183, 8, pp. 5208-5220, (2009); Hoang, Anh N., The neutral lipid composition present in the digestive vacuole of plasmodium falciparum concentrates heme and mediates β-hematin formation with an unusually low activation energy, Biochemistry, 49, 47, pp. 10107-10116, (2010); Jaramillo, Maritza, Hemozoin induces macrophage chemokine expression through oxidative stress-dependent and -independent mechanisms, Journal of Immunology, 174, 1, pp. 475-484, (2005)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20794991","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203680041"

This study investigated the effect of miR-27a-5p on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-stimulated hDPCs showed concurrent increases in the expression of miR-27a-5p and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1), and the increased expression was suppressed by NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-0785. Transfection of the miR-27a-5p mimic downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB activity, and the expression of NF-κB signaling activators (TAB1, IRAK4, RELA, and FSTL1) in LPS-stimulated hDPCs. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-27a-5p bound directly to the 3’-UTR of TAB1. siTAB1 downregulated NF-κB activity and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression, NF-κB activity, and NF-κB signaling activator expression (TAB1, IRAK4, and RELA) was also found in LPS-stimulated rat incisor pulp tissue explants following transfection with the miR-27a-5p mimic ex vivo. MiR-27a-5p, whose expression was induced by NF-κB signaling, negatively regulated the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines via targeting NF-κB signaling. In particular, TAB1, a potent NF-κB activator, was targeted by miR-27a-5p. These results provide insights into the negative regulatory effects of miR-27a-5p, particularly those targeting the TAB1-NF-κB signaling pathway, on pulp inflammation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human Dental Pulp Cell;

PVA-gel beads with 5 % magnetite and 0.5 % starch were optimal for physical strength and treatment performance. A pair of 2 L-up-flow anaerobic sludge blankets (UASB), one with the bead (UB) and another without (U) as a controller, operated continuously at 30 °C and an HRT of 11–24 h for 302 days. UB showed better performance than U in most phases, especially with influent dye of 200 mg·L−1, suggesting a greater tolerance to dye toxicity of UB than U. Microbial analysis revealed that the PVA/Fe/starch gel beads successfully captured the dye degrader Clostridium. Diversity indices indicated that PVA/Fe/Starch gel beads effectively support microbial diversity and resilience under varying dye concentrations. Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential of PVA/Fe/Starch gel beads to improve the stability and efficiency of the dye treatment system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Azo Dye; Magnetite; Microbial Community Analysis; Microbial Immobilization; Starch; Uasb; Ferric Ion; Iron; Magnetite; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Starch; Azo Compounds; Coloring Agents; Gels; Iron; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Sewage; Starch; Azo Dyes; Magnetite; Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Reactor; Anerobic Treatment; Azo-dyes; Gel Beads; L-up-flow Anerobic Sludge Blanket; Microbial Community Analysis; Microbial Immobilization; Starch Gels; Treatment Performance; Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blankets; Starch; Azo Dye; Dye; Ferric Ion; Gel; Iron; Magnetite; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Starch; Azo Compound; Coloring Agent; Microbial Community; Sludge; Toxicity; Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digestion; Anaerobic Sludge; Article; Clostridium; Hormone Substitution; Immobilization; Microbial Diversity; Pharmaceutics; Anaerobic Growth; Bioreactor; Bioremediation; Chemistry; Microbiology; Procedures; Sewage; Water Management; Anaerobiosis; Azo Compounds; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Coloring Agents; Gels; Iron; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Sewage; Water Purification","Azo dyes; Magnetite; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic reactor; Anerobic treatment; Azo-dyes; Gel beads; L-up-flow anerobic sludge blanket; Microbial community analysis; Microbial immobilization; Starch gels; Treatment performance; Upflow anaerobic sludge blankets; Starch; azo dye; dye; ferric ion; gel; iron; magnetite; polyvinyl alcohol; starch; azo compound; coloring agent; microbial community; sludge; toxicity; wastewater treatment; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic sludge; Article; Clostridium; hormone substitution; immobilization; microbial diversity; pharmaceutics; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; bioremediation; chemistry; microbiology; procedures; sewage; water management; Anaerobiosis; Azo Compounds; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Coloring Agents; Gels; Iron; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Sewage; Water Purification","","ferric ion, 20074-52-6; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnetite, 1309-38-2, 1317-61-9; polyvinyl alcohol, 37380-95-3, 9002-89-5; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Azo Compounds; Coloring Agents; Gels; Iron; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Sewage; Starch","The study was supported by the Ministry of Environment, Japan, the WISE Program, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant number 22 J15518 ), and Kurita Water and Environmental Foundation.","Bafana, Amit, Biodiversity and dye decolourization ability of an acclimatized textile sludge, Bioresource Technology, 99, 11, pp. 5094-5098, (2008); Benkhaya, Said, Classifications, properties, recent synthesis and applications of azo dyes, Heliyon, 6, 1, (2020); Bolyen, Evan, Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2, Nature Biotechnology, 37, 8, pp. 852-857, (2019); Caizán-Juanarena, Leire, Screening for electrical conductivity in anaerobic granular sludge from full-scale wastewater treatment reactors, Biochemical Engineering Journal, 159, (2020); Callahan, Benjamin J., DADA2: High-resolution sample inference from Illumina amplicon data, Nature Methods, 13, 7, pp. 581-583, (2016); Sharma, Subed Chandra Dev, Decolorization of azo dye methyl red by suspended and co-immobilized bacterial cells with mediators anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate and Fe3O4 nanoparticles, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation, 112, pp. 88-97, (2016); Ruobin, Dai, Inhibitory effect and mechanism of azo dyes on anaerobic methanogenic wastewater treatment: Can redox mediator remediate the inhibition?, Water Research, 104, pp. 408-417, (2016); Ruobin, Dai, Understanding azo dye anaerobic bio-decolorization with artificial redox mediator supplement: Considering the methane production, Bioresource Technology, 249, pp. 799-808, (2018); Du, Linna, Efficient metabolism of the azo dye methyl orange by Aeromonas sp. strain DH-6: Characteristics and partial mechanism, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation, 105, pp. 66-72, (2015); Gerlach, Robin, Influence of carbon sources and electron shuttles on ferric iron reduction by Cellulomonas sp. strain ES6, Biodegradation, 22, 5, pp. 983-995, (2011)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18732976; 09608524","","BIRTE","39019198","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198920838"

However, astaxanthin production from H. pluvialis is constrained by factors such as a lengthy cultivation period and thick cell walls. Recent research has explored different strategies, such as optimising cultivation conditions, to enhance astaxanthin biosynthesis. This review paper aims to summarise the recent advancement of metabolic and genetic engineering in astaxanthin biosynthesis from H. pluvialis. The review would provide a comprehensive analysis of the molecular components and mechanism involved in the biosynthesis pathway of astaxanthin in H. pluvialis, revealing the specific genes responsible for governing its biosynthesis. Numerous metabolic methodologies are investigated, including manipulating light intensity, salinity, nutrient deficiency, and temperature to enhance microalgae biomass and astaxanthin accumulation. Genetic engineering strategies have recently been studied to manipulate specific genes (e.g. bkt, CrtR-b, pds) to increase astaxanthin production. However, the limitation of genetic engineering is still unclear due to its mechanism of astaxanthin esterification and the transport of secondary β-carotenoids from the chloroplast to the cytosol. This lack of understanding has posed a challenge to maximise astaxanthin production through genetic engineering. This review also provides recent insights and future research directions for genetic engineering by providing a holistic approach to the complex interplay of genetics, metabolism, and biotechnological strategies to maximise astaxanthin production. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Astaxanthin; Biosynthesis Pathway; Genetic Engineering; Haematococcus Pluvialis; Metabolic Engineering; Microalgae","","","","Funding text 1: The authors would also like to acknowledge UCSI University Research Excellence & Innovation Grant (REIG) [REIGFAS-2022/003].

Generally, pyrolysis is carried out in an inert atmosphere; however, reactive catalytic pyrolysis has emerged as an alternative technique for achieving high catalytic efficiency. Herein, NiCe/CN catalysts with different Ni:Ce ratios were developed, and their catalytic efficiency in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of palm kernel shells in a CO<inf>2</inf> atmosphere was evaluated. The effects of reaction conditions, including the reaction temperature (400–600 °C) and ratio of Ni:Ce (10:0, 10:1, 10:3, 10:5, and 10:10), on the product yields were studied using in situ and ex situ analyses. NiCe/CN50 exhibited enhanced oxygen removal efficiency owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies in CeO<inf>x</inf>. In addition, the acidic site of the catalyst promoted the highly selective demethoxylation of alkylphenols. The presence of Ce promoted the Boudouard reaction (C + CO<inf>2</inf> → 2CO), which reduced coke deposition on the spent catalyst. Our results indicate that the NiCe/CN50 catalyst exhibited good catalytic efficiency, achieving the highly selective production of alkylphenols and acetic acid and low deactivation. Therefore, NiCe/CN50 can be used as an alternative catalyst for phenol production from biomass via catalytic fast pyrolysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Co2 Utilization; N-doped Activated Carbon; Ni Catalyst; Pyrolysis; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysts; Cerium; Doping (additives); Efficiency; Palm Oil; Pyrolysis; Bio-oils; Catalytic Efficiencies; Co2 Utilization; Fast Pyrolysis; N-doped; N-doped Activated Carbon; Ni Catalysts; Palm Kernel Shells; Selective Production; ]+ Catalyst; Activated Carbon","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Cerium; Doping (additives); Efficiency; Palm oil; Pyrolysis; Bio-oils; Catalytic efficiencies; CO2 utilization; Fast pyrolysis; N-doped; N-doped activated carbon; Ni catalysts; Palm kernel shells; Selective production; ]+ catalyst; Activated carbon","","","This study was financially supported by the National Research Council of Thailand [contract no.

The ligand-field-induced splitting of d states and spd hybridizations in copper are thoroughly examined. The hybridization between Cu s, p, and d orbitals occurs in various forms to optimize the Coulomb repulsion of different ligand fields. Despite the Cu+ oxidation state, which is typically conducive to strong Kubas interactions with hydrogen molecules, the vacant spd<inf>z2</inf> hybrid orbitals of the open copper site in the L(CuL<inf>2</inf>) coordination are unsuitable for facilitating electron forward donation, thereby preventing effective hydrogen adsorption. In contrast, the vacant spd<inf>z2</inf> hybrid orbitals in the T(CuL<inf>3</inf>) and P(CuL<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf> coordinations can engage in electron forward donations, forming bonding states between the Cu spd<inf>z2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> σ bonding orbitals. The forward donation in the T(CuL<inf>3</inf>) configuration is significantly stronger than in the P(CuL<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf> configuration due to both the lower energy of the vacant orbitals and the larger contributions of p and d<inf>z2</inf> characters to the hybrid orbital. Additionally, the occupied Cu pd<inf>xz/yz</inf> and pd<inf>x2-y2</inf> hybrid orbitals in the T(CuL<inf>3</inf>) configuration promote electron back donation to the H<inf>2</inf> σ* antibonding orbital, leading to the formation of π bonding states. In the P(CuL<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf> coordination, the repulsion from the electron density distributed over the surrounding ligands prevents the H<inf>2</inf> molecule from approaching the copper center closely enough for the back donation to occur. The complete Kubas interaction, involving both forward and back electron donations, results in a large dihydrogen-copper binding energy of 37.6 kJ mol−1 in the T(CuL<inf>3</inf>) coordination.

A random forest classifier with feature selection yielded modest success in the classification of high- and low-motivation states. Further analysis linked high-motivation states to the indices of autonomic nervous system activation reflective of reduced sympathetic activation and stronger, more intense expressions of happiness.

In the pretreatment, SCB is processed to break down the cellulose-lignin-hemicellulose matrix and isolate components. This work proposes a formic/peroxyformic acid process for extracting cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from SCB. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (ss- 13C NMR) were employed to evidence the removal of wax, hemicellulose, and lignin from the raw SCB. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used for analyzing crystallinity, morphology, and thermal properties. SEM results showed that after lignin removal, the size of purified cellulose fibrils decreased significantly, and the structure of cellulose microfibers became smoother and more apparent. After acid hydrolysis of bleached cellulose microfibers, XRD analysis showed CNCs had the highest crystallinity (70.8 %). In TEM images, rod-like structures of CNCs were measured to be 23 ± 2.7 nm wide and 610 ± 18 nm long. The eco-friendly formic/peroxyformic acid procedure with a chlorine-free bleaching stage produced a white, cellulose-rich solid powder of CNCs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellulose Microfibers; Cellulose Nanocrystals; Formic/peroxyformic Acid Process; Sugarcane Bagasse; Bagasse; Bleaching; Cleaning; Crystallinity; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Lignin; Nanocrystals; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Thermodynamic Properties; Thermogravimetric Analysis; X Ray Diffraction; Acid Process; Biomass Source; Break Down; Cellulose Extraction; Cellulose Microfiber; Formic/peroxyformic Acid Process; Matrix; Micro-fiber; Pre-treatments; Sugar-cane Bagasse; Cellulose; Gravimetry; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Thermal Analysis","Bagasse; Bleaching; Cleaning; Crystallinity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lignin; Nanocrystals; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermodynamic properties; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Acid process; Biomass source; Break down; Cellulose extraction; Cellulose microfiber; Formic/peroxyformic acid process; matrix; Micro-fiber; Pre-treatments; Sugar-cane bagasse; Cellulose; Gravimetry; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Thermal Analysis","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2021-18\u201324.

In this study, we aimed to develop a reactive extraction method to separate GA from aqueous solutions using 2-naphthaleneboronic acid (2NB) and tri-octyl methyl ammonium chloride (TOMAC). Different feed molar amounts of 2NB (0–25 µmol), TOMAC (0–500 µmol), and NaOH (0–250 µmol) were used for GA (2.5 µmol) separation. A combination of 25 µmol 2NB, 100 µmol TOMAC, and 25 µmol NaOH was determined to be optimal for GA separation, providing 66.8 ± 3.2% GA yield at pH 11. GA was extracted by 2NB and TOMAC in a coordinated manner. Moreover, effects of various carboxylic acids (acetic, lactic, succinic, malic, tartaric, and citric acids) on GA separation from aqueous solutions were investigated. Interestingly, no significant effect on GA yeild (60.3 ± 1.2–65.2 ± 2.5%) was observed regardless of the type of carboxylic acid. The optimized protocol was subsequently applied to separate GA from crude GA solution prepared by incubating glycerol with the cells of the acetic acid bacterium, Acetobacter tropicalis NBRC 16470. GA separation was achieved at a comparable level (yield: 70.6 ± 4.6% and purity: 76.1 ± 4.1%) as that achieved using a GA reagent. This study demonstrated the efficiency of the repeated use of the organic phase for GA separation, with no significant changes in GA yield. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2-naphthaleneboronic Acid; Glyceric Acid; Reactive Extraction; Tri-octyl Methyl Ammonium Chloride; Carboxylic Acids; Extraction; Sodium Hydroxide; 2-naphthaleneboronic Acid; Acid Separation; Acid Yields; Ammonium Chloride; Bioresource; Carboxylic Group; Glyceric Acid; Microbial Process; Reactive Extraction; Tri-octyl Methyl Ammonium Chloride; Chlorine Compounds","Carboxylic acids; Extraction; Sodium hydroxide; 2-naphthaleneboronic acid; Acid separation; Acid yields; Ammonium chloride; Bioresource; Carboxylic group; Glyceric acid; Microbial process; Reactive extraction; Tri-octyl methyl ammonium chloride; Chlorine compounds","","","","Ling, Hua, Microbial tolerance engineering toward biochemical production: From lignocellulose to products, Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 29, 1, pp. 99-106, (2014); Du, Jing, Engineering microbial factories for synthesis of value-added products, Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, 38, 8, pp. 873-890, (2011); Cho, Jae-sung, Designing Microbial Cell Factories for the Production of Chemicals, JACS Au, 2, 8, pp. 1781-1799, (2022); Ho Ahn, Jung, Recent advances in microbial production of medium chain fatty acid from renewable carbon resources: A comprehensive review, Bioresource Technology, 381, (2023); Flores Bueso, Yensi, Synthetic Biology in the Driving Seat of the Bioeconomy, Trends in Biotechnology, 35, 5, pp. 373-378, (2017); Bonnet, Marion, Bacterial culture through selective and non-selective conditions: the evolution of culture media in clinical microbiology, New Microbes and New Infections, 34, (2020); Schafhauser, Thomas, Isolation and Purification of Natural Products from Microbial Cultures, Methods in Molecular Biology, 2601, pp. 75-96, (2023); Grote, Florian, Downstream of downstream processing: Development of recycling strategies for biopharmaceutical processes, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 87, 4, pp. 481-497, (2012); Wang, Yuan, Hyperspectral monitor of soil chromium contaminant based on deep learning network model in the Eastern Junggar coalfield, Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy, 257, (2021); Wasewar, Kailas, Reactive extraction of lactic acid using alamine 336 in MIBK: Equilibria and kinetics, Journal of Biotechnology, 97, 1, pp. 59-68, (2002)","","Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering","","","","","","12268372; 19763816","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192769621"

Studies looking at low power consumption accompanied by high-performance memory are essential for next-generation memory. Here, Graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), characterized by facile resistive switching behavior, is systematically reported toward a low switching voltage memristor. The intrinsic large, homogeneous pore-size structure in GDYO facilitates ion diffusion processes, effectively suppressing the operating voltage. The theoretical approach highlights the remarkably low diffusion energy of the Ag ion (0.11 eV) and oxygen functional group (0.6 eV) within three layers of GDYO. The Ag/GDYO/Au memristor exhibits an ultralow operating voltage of 0.25 V with a GDYO thickness of 5 nm; meanwhile, the thicker GDYO of 29 nm presents multilevel memory with an ON/OFF ratio of up to 104.

Hence, searching for potential MOFs like M<inf>2</inf>(BDC)<inf>2</inf>(DABCO) to enhance the CH<inf>4</inf> storage capacity in both gravimetric and volumetric uptakes is essential. Herein, we systematically elucidate the adsorption of CH<inf>4</inf> in M<inf>2</inf>(BDC)<inf>2</inf>(DABCO) or M(DABCO) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) MOFs using multiscale simulations that combined grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation with van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) calculation. We find that, in the M(DABCO) series, Mg(DABCO) has the highest total CH<inf>4</inf> adsorption capacities, with (Formula presented.) 231.39 mg/g at 298 K, for gravimetric uptake, and (Formula presented.) 231.43 cc(STP)/cc, for volumetric uptake. The effects of temperature, pressure, and metal substitution on enhancing CH<inf>4</inf> storage are evaluated, and we predict that the volumetric CH<inf>4</inf> storage capacity on M(DABCO) could meet the DOE target at temperatures of ca. 238 K–268 K and pressures of 35–100 bar. The interactions between CH<inf>4</inf> and M(DABCO) are dominated by the vdW interactions, as shown by the vdW-DF calculations. The Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni substitutions in M(DABCO) result in a stronger interaction and thus, a higher CH<inf>4</inf> storage capacity, at higher pressures for Mg, Mn, Ni, and Co and at lower pressures for Fe.

The promising usage of magnetic biochar (MBC) derived from watermelon rind has been explored in the adsorption of various contaminants owing to its high specific surface area and separability; however, the temperature-dependent changes of MBC and its sorption ability toward antibiotics have not been widely examined. Method: Tunable MBCs could be synthesized via simple pyrolysis of watermelon rind impregnated with FeCl<inf>3</inf> at different temperatures (700–900 °C). The as-synthesized MBCs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an elemental analyzer, N<inf>2</inf> adsorption/desorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Then Tetracycline, an emerging contaminant in water reservoirs, was employed as the target contaminant, while adsorption kinetics, isotherm, the effect of pH, and reusability were investigated. Significant findings: The tunability of as-synthesized MBCs could be observed by their distinct changes in structural characteristics when varying pyrolysis temperature. MBC synthesized at 900 °C (MBC900) possessed a high-specific surface area (401 m2.g−1) and saturation magnetization (55.29 emu.g−1), resulting in a greater amount of sorption sites. Tetracycline adsorption by MBCs followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and fitted well with the Freundlich model. MBC900 is an excellent adsorbent with a maximum adsorption capacity of 77.6 mg.g−1 and could be used for at least five cycles with an insignificant decrease in the adsorption capacity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Magnetic Biochar; Pyrolysis; Tetracycline; Chlorine Compounds; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Iron Compounds; Pyrolysis; Reservoirs (water); Reusability; Saturation Magnetization; Scanning Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction Analysis; Adsorption Capacities; Biochar; Emerging Contaminant; High Specific Surface Area; Magnetic Biochar; Pyrolysis Temperature; Synthesised; Tetracycline; Tunables; Watermelon Rinds; Adsorption","Chlorine compounds; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Iron compounds; Pyrolysis; Reservoirs (water); Reusability; Saturation magnetization; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Adsorption capacities; Biochar; Emerging contaminant; High specific surface area; Magnetic biochar; Pyrolysis temperature; Synthesised; Tetracycline; Tunables; Watermelon rinds; Adsorption","","","This work has been supported by Ratchadapisek Somphot Fund, Chulalongkorn University for CEPT, Dept. of Chem.

This can help to prolong the shelf life of fresh produce. The poor water vapor barrier, ultraviolet (UV), mechanical, and antifungal capacities of alginate film limit its application in fruit preservation. In this study, alginate (Alg) films with improved water vapor permeability (WVP), mechanical properties, and ultraviolet (UV) barrier were prepared with ylang-ylang oil (YYO) Pickering emulsion (PE). YYO was added as an antimicrobial agent. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were used as natural stabilizers to prepare YYO PE. The final coating comprised 1% Alg (alginate), Alg/0.24% CNCs, and Alg/0.5% YYO PE. The impacts of YYO-PE on the properties of Alg films were investigated, and their effects on post-harvest control of mandarins were evaluated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to identify the components of YYO. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed an increase in the roughness of the films containing the Alg/YYO PE. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed no new interactions in the Alg/YYO PE films. Moisture content (MC) and thermal properties were lower for Alg/YYO-PE films. The Alg/YYO-PE coating lowered the weight loss (7.84 ± 1.76%) and inhibited (p < 0.05) the growth of Penicillium italicum (P. italicum) and Penicillium digitatum (P. digitatum). The inhibition percentages were 56.02% and 47.98%, respectively, for the inoculated mandarins. In conclusion, the Alg/YYO PE coating and film have the potential to be an eco-friendly active packaging material in the food sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellulose Nanocrystals;

The copper-doped TiO<inf>2</inf> molar ratio in the nanocomposite was found to possess a pronounced impact on the dye removal and self-cleaning effects under the visible light spectrum, whereas TiO<inf>2</inf> is highly effective under specific UV-light irradiation. Optical measurements and dye decomposition showed that the Cu-doped TiO<inf>2</inf> nanocomposite was optimized at a 1% molar ratio by the copper-doping concentration regarding dye removal and self-cleaning applications under the visible light range. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was funded by the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training under grant no.

However, two significant obstacles still need to be addressed, including the low ionic conductivities and the low interfacial contact between ASSB components. This study involves the fabrication of hexagonal CuS nanoparticles by a one-step hydrothermal method and uses them for both cathode and solid electrolyte formulation functions. The reasonable ionic conductivity of 4.68 × 10−4 S.cm−1 at 60℃ and the instant transport number of 0.86 of the designed CuS filler-incorporated solid electrolyte offered great promise for ASSBs applications. In particular, the CuS filler-incorporated solid electrolyte exhibited ceaseless and prompt Li-ion transportation kinetics and delivered a dendrite resistance capability over 200 cycles of stripping/plating of Li. In addition, the Li metal solid-state battery is also verified using CuS as the cathode and SPE electrolyte (PEO/LiTFSI/CuS SPE) system. It offers an initial discharge capacity of up to 695 mAh/g and keeps an average capacity of ∼ 365 mAh/g after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.5C. Thus, this study introduced a simple but effective solution to mitigate the dendrite problems associated with solid polymer electrolytes by using CuS as a durable inactive filler. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cus Cathode; Cus Filler-solid Electrolyte; Ionic Conductivity; Lithium Dendrites; Cathodes; Copper Compounds; Filled Polymers; Fillers; Ionic Conduction In Solids; Ionic Conductivity; Lithium Compounds; Lithium-ion Batteries; Nanoparticles; Polyelectrolytes; Solid State Devices; Solid-state Batteries; Sulfur Compounds; All-solid-state Battery; All-solid-state Lithium Battery; Bi-functional; Cus Cathode; Cus Filler-solid Electrolyte; Electrolyte Additives; Lithium Dendrite; Performance; Solid Polymer Electrolytes; Two In Ones; Solid Electrolytes","Cathodes; Copper compounds; Filled polymers; Fillers; Ionic conduction in solids; Ionic conductivity; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanoparticles; Polyelectrolytes; Solid state devices; Solid-State Batteries; Sulfur compounds; All-solid-state battery; All-solid-state lithium battery; Bi-functional; CuS cathode; CuS filler-solid electrolyte; Electrolyte additives; Lithium dendrite; Performance; Solid polymer electrolytes; Two in ones; Solid electrolytes","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-XS-001.","Front Batter Electrochem, (2022); Frontiers in Batteries and Electrochemistry, (2022); Soundharrajan, Vaiyapuri, LiV3O8 as an intercalation-type cathode for aqueous aluminum-ion batteries, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 10, 35, pp. 18162-18169, (2022); Kim, Seokhun, Microwave-assisted rapid synthesis of nh4v4o10 layered oxide: A high energy cathode for aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries, Nanomaterials, 11, 8, (2021); Nithiananth, Subramanian, Transition divalent metal substitution in chalcopyrite CuInSe2 (In = Co, Ni, and Mn) counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cell applications, Materials Letters, 308, (2022); Front Batteries Electrochem, (2024); Pillai, Akhilash Mohanan, Surface Modification on Nickel Rich Cathode Materials for Lithium-Ion Cells: A Mini Review, Chemical Record, 23, 11, (2023); Pillai, Akhilash Mohanan, Synthesis and characterization of Li1.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2: A high-capacity cathode material with improved thermal stability and rate capability for lithium-ion cells, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 938, (2023); Soundharrajan, Vaiyapuri, Bitter gourd-shaped Ni3V2O8 anode developed by a one-pot metal-organic framework-combustion technique for advanced Li-ion batteries, Ceramics International, 43, 16, pp. 13224-13232, (2017); Soundharrajan, Vaiyapuri, Facile green synthesis of a Co3V2O8 nanoparticle electrode for high energy lithium-ion battery applications, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 501, pp. 133-141, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15726657","","JECHE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189503203"

Here, we investigate the optoelectronic properties of hexagonal and nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots using the first-principles method. We find that doping nitrogen atoms to hexagonal graphene quantum dots results in a significant red shift toward the visible light range as compared to that of the pristine graphene quantum dots, and the doped nitrogen atoms also induce a clear signature of anisotropy of the frontier orbitals induced by the electron correlation between the doped nitrogen atoms and their adjacent carbon atoms. Moreover, time-dependent density functional theory calculations with the M06-2X functional and 6-311++G(d,p) basis set reproduce well the experimental absorption spectra reported recently.

Pectin, a biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide, has shown promise for the synthesis of porous particles, especially in the biomedical and food industries. The high viscosity of pectin and CaCO<inf>3</inf> nanoparticle (NP) solutions has been a significant challenge for producing these particles. This study introduces a novel spray drying technique with a three-fluid nozzle, designed to handle high-viscosity solutions and to increase production rates by 30-fold over the conventional two-fluid nozzle. Using the proposed technique, notable improvements are achieved in particle surface areas and pore volumes by controlling the distribution of CaCO<inf>3</inf> NPs within the pectin particles, especially at a CaCO<inf>3</inf> NPs to pectin ratio of 15. This resulted in porous pectin particles with sizes of 3.4 to 6.2 μm, surface areas of up to 261 m2/g, and enhanced lysozyme adsorption capacities are obtained by varying types of precursor solutions. Thus, this approach facilitates the synthesis of multifunctional composites and porous particles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nanosctructured Particle; Pectin; Porous Particle; Powder Process; Spray Drying; Three-fluid Nozzle; Calcium Carbonate; Lysozyme; Pectin; Ultra Turrax S004; Uv 2450; Zetasizer Nano Zsp; Biocompatibility; Calcite; Porous Materials; Spray Nozzles; Viscosity; High Surface Area; High Viscosities; Interconnected Porosity; Nanosctructured Particle; Particle Formations; Pectin; Porous Particle; Powder Process; Spray-drying; Three-fluid Nozzle; Calcium Carbonate; Calcium Carbonate; Lysozyme; Pectin; Polysaccharide; Adsorption; Aerosol; Air Temperature; Article; Barrett Joyner Halenda Method; Biocompatibility; Biodegradability; Brunauer Emmett Teller Method; Dispersity; Encapsulation; Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy; Gas Flow; Isoelectric Point; Nonhuman; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Pectin Particle Formation; Pore Volume; Porosity; Shear Rate; Spray Drying; Surface Area; Three Fluid Nozzle; Ultrasound; Viscosity; Zeta Potential","Biocompatibility; Calcite; Porous materials; Spray nozzles; Viscosity; High surface area; High viscosities; Interconnected porosity; Nanosctructured particle; Particle formations; Pectin; Porous particle; Powder process; Spray-drying; Three-fluid nozzle; Calcium carbonate; calcium carbonate; lysozyme; pectin; polysaccharide; adsorption; aerosol; air temperature; Article; Barrett Joyner Halenda method; biocompatibility; biodegradability; Brunauer Emmett Teller method; dispersity; encapsulation; field emission scanning electron microscopy; gas flow; isoelectric point; nonhuman; particle size; particulate matter; pectin particle formation; pore volume; porosity; shear rate; spray drying; surface area; three fluid nozzle; ultrasound; viscosity; zeta potential","","calcium carbonate, 13397-26-7, 13701-58-1, 14791-73-2, 471-34-1; lysozyme, 9001-63-2; pectin, 9000-69-5","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP23H01745 (T.O.), JP22K20482 and JP23K13590 (T.H.).

We investigated the effects of maternal TCDD exposure and the toxic equivalent quantity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (TEQ-PCDD/Fs) on the sex ratio at birth in 576 Vietnamese infants from three birth cohorts. TCDD and TEQ-PCDD/Fs in breast milk were stratified (low, mild, moderate, and high) as maternal exposure markers. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between female birth and dioxin exposure groups after adjusting for confounders. In sprayed and unsprayed areas, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of female birth (reference: low-TCDD group) were 2.11 in the moderate-TCDD group and 2.77 in the high-TCDD group, which were significantly associated with increased TCDD exposure.

In this study, potassium oxalate (K<inf>2</inf>C<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>), a less toxic and non-corrosive activating reagent, was used to synthesize activated carbon from the solid residue after autohydrolysis treatment. The effect of the autohydrolysis treatment and the ratio of the K<inf>2</inf>C<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/solid residue are presented in this study. Moreover, the comparison between the activated carbon from bamboo and biochar from the solid residue are also reported. The resulting activated carbon from the solid residue exhibited a high surface area of up to 1432 m2·g−1 and a total pore volume of up to 0.88 cm3·g−1. The autohydrolysis treatment enhanced the microporosity properties compared to those without pretreatment of the activated carbon. The microporosity of the activated carbon from the solid residue was dominated by the pore width at 0.7 nm, which is excellent for CO<inf>2</inf> storage. At 25 °C and 1.013 × 105 Pa, the CO<inf>2</inf> captured reached up to 4.1 mmol·g−1.

The ratio of the K<inf>2</inf>C<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/solid residue of 2 could help the carbon material reach a highly microporous textural property that produces a high carbon capture capacity. Our finding proved the benefit of using the solid residue from the autohydrolysis treatment as a precursor material and offering a more friendly and sustainable activation carbon process.

Here, a novel gradient-pore-size titanium scaffold was designed and manufactured to address these requirements. The scaffold features a larger pore size (900 μm) on the top surface, gradually decreasing to small sizes (600 μm to 300 μm) towards the center, creating a gradient structure. To enhance its functionality, the additively manufactured scaffolds were biofunctionalized using simple chemical and heat treatments so as to incorporate calcium and iodine ions throughout the surface. This unique combination of varying pore sizes with a biofunctional surface provides highly desirable mechanical properties, bioactivity, and notably, long-lasting antibacterial activity. The target mechanical aspects, including low elastic modulus, high compression, compression-shear, and fatigue strength, were effectively achieved. Furthermore, the biofunctional surface exhibits remarkable in vitro bioactivity and potent antibacterial activity, even under conditions specifically altered to be favorable for bacterial growth. More importantly, the integration of small pores alongside larger ones ensures a sustained high release of iodine, resulting in antimicrobial activity that persisted for over three months, with full eradication of the bacteria. Taken together, this gradient structure exhibits obvious superiority in combining most of the desired properties, making it an ideal candidate for orthopedic and dental implant applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibacterial Activity; Apatite; Biocompatibility; Gradient Pores; Iodine; Mechanical Properties; Selective Laser Melting; Iodine; Titanium; Anti-bacterial Agents; Iodine; Ions; Titanium; Bacteria; Iodine; Phosphate Minerals; Pore Size; Scaffolds; Selective Laser Melting; Anti-bacterial Activity; Antibacterial Properties; Bioactives; Biofunctional; Gradient Pore; Gradient Structure; Iodine Ions; Long Lasting; Mechanical; Biocompatibility; Antiinfective Agent; Iodine; Ion; Titanium; Anti-bacterial Agents; Ions; Protective Devices; Titanium","Bacteria; Iodine; Phosphate minerals; Pore size; Scaffolds; Selective laser melting; Anti-bacterial activity; Antibacterial properties; Bioactives; Biofunctional; Gradient pore; Gradient structure; Iodine ions; Long lasting; Mechanical; Biocompatibility; antiinfective agent; iodine; ion; titanium; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ions; Protective Devices; Titanium","","iodine, 7553-56-2; titanium, 7440-32-6; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Iodine; Ions; Titanium","This work was supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency , Gant Number JPMJTR20TA .

Natural rubber-grafted-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with a special nanostructure was synthesized by graft copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) onto the surface of natural rubber (NR) particles using tert-butylhydroperoxide/tetraethylenepentamine as initiators. Optimal conditions for achieving high conversion and grafting efficiency were identified. Characterization of the as-synthesized samples was performed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, tensile measurement, swelling degree determination, and cytotoxicity testing. The results revealed that HEMA formed a nanoscale matrix surrounding NR particles, which improved the tensile strength, thermal resistance, and swelling degree of the as-prepared samples. Cytotoxicity testing demonstrated that the membrane was safe for human use, as it did not exhibit toxicity to Vero cells at concentrations up to 1024 µg/mL. Furthermore, the membrane displayed a high adsorption capacity toward Fe3+ and was well described by Koble-Corrigan isotherm model and the first–second-order kinetic equation. Moreover, the membrane demonstrated excellent recyclability maintaining its adsorption ability towards Fe3+ ions over five consecutive cycles. Overall, these findings may recommend the NR-HEMA membrane as a promising candidate for metal removal applications.

However, they still have limitations, such as knowing the information of the structure in advance, only processing simple structures, limited effectiveness for structures with a depth of about 15 mm, and the need to use separated deep learning networks for de-blurring and estimating information. Furthermore, the current technique cannot handle multiple structures distributed at different depths next to each other in the same image. To overcome the mentioned limitations in transillumination imaging, this study proposed a pixel-by-pixel scanning technique in combination with deep learning networks (Attention Res-UNet for scattering suppression and DenseNet-169 for depth estimation) to estimate the existence of each pixel and the relative structural depth information. The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated through experiments that involved a complex model within a tissue-equivalent phantom and a mouse, achieving a reconstruction error of (Formula presented.) % compared to the dimensions of the ground truth when using the fully convolutional network. Furthermore, we could use the depth matrix obtained from the convolutional neural network (DenseNet-169) to reconstruct the absorbing structures using a binary thresholding method, which produced a reconstruction error of (Formula presented.) %. Therefore, only one convolutional neural network (DenseNet-169) must be used for depth estimation and explicit image reconstruction. Therefore, it reduces time and computational resources. With depth information at each pixel, reconstruction of 3D image of the de-blurred structures could be performed even from a single blurred image. These results confirm the feasibility and robustness of the proposed pixel-by-pixel scanning technique to restore the internal structure of the body, including intricate networks such as blood vessels or abnormal tissues. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention Res-unet; De-blurred; Densenet169; Depth Estimation; Pixel-by-pixel; Reconstructing 3d; Transillumination Image","","","","The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hokkaido University (protocol code: 2010-02, date of approval: 28 July 2010).

Gasification was carried out employing a 20 kWe commercial gasification system with macadamia nut shell, bagasse, and rice straw. Subsequently, post-gasification residues were meticulously collected, analyzed and utilized for CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption experiments. Among these residual chars, macadamia nut shell demonstrated the highest CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption capacity, followed by bagasse, while rice straw showed moderate performance. In laboratory conditions (25 °C, 1 bar, without the influence of ambient moisture or CO<inf>2</inf> diffusion constraint), the post-gasification residue from macadamia nut shell achieved a CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption capacity of 2.8 mmol g−1, followed by bagasse (2.4 mmol g−1). Transitioning to more practical conditions (25 °C, 1 bar, considering the influence of ambient moisture and CO<inf>2</inf> diffusion limitations within an adsorbent bed), the macadamia nut shell and bagasse residual chars reached 2.7 mmol g−1 and 2.3 mmol g−1, respectively. Moreover, these chars exhibited noteworthy CO<inf>2</inf>/N<inf>2</inf> selectivity and recyclability, making them comparable to various advanced CO<inf>2</inf> adsorbents investigated in prior studies. The superior performance of the macadamia nut shell-derived residual char can be attributed to its highest microporous/ultra-microporous volumes and concentrations of basic and aromatic functional groups on the char's surface.

The approach combined electrochemical techniques with filtration processes to manage the wastewater, which exhibited high levels of total dissolved solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), organic matter, and chlorine concentration, requiring treatment before disposal or potential reuse. A specialized electrochemical oxidation (EO) system was customized for processing 500 mL of solution at a 2A current, working in tandem with an activated carbon filter chamber. Various experiments were conducted, altering potential and adsorption times, to understand their correlation in eliminating the identified pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater. Notably, sample 4 (S4), following an electrolysis process at 2A-12 V in 5 h and subsequent adsorption by 10 g of activated carbon for 60 min, exhibited remarkable efficacy Specifically, this treatment regime facilitated the removal of over 90 % (from 14,750 to 1422 mg/L) of chlorine concentration, 91 % (from 1.12 to 0.09 a.u.) of turbidity, and 88 % (from 22,676 to 2786 mg/L) of COD from the effluent stream. These favorable outcomes were attributed to the conversion of chlorine ions into hypochlorous acid, renowned for its potent antibacterial properties in eliminating organic compounds, as well as the robust adsorption capabilities of activated carbon.

The combination of graphene and two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is expected to increase the mechanical stability and enhance the adsorption performance of these gas sensors. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that two-dimensional graphene/h-BN double layers can be used as good substrates for gas sensors with a small lattice mismatch of only 1.78%. Moreover, the presence of a h-BN layer widens the band gap by about 38 meV and considerably increases the work function, thus positively affecting the gas adsorption performance. Although these graphene/h-BN heterostructures do not change the physical adsorption mechanism of these sensors concerning the graphene-based materials, these bilayers significantly enhance the sensitivity of these sensors for detecting CO<inf>2</inf>, CO, NO, and NO<inf>2</inf> toxic gases. Particularly, compared to the pristine graphene-based materials, the gas adsorption energies of graphene/h-BN increased by up to 13.78% for the adsorption of NO, and the shortest distances between the graphene/h-BN substrates and adsorbed gas molecules decreased. We also show that the graphene/h-BN heterostructure is more selective towards NO<inf>x</inf> gases while more inert towards CO<inf>x</inf> gases, based on the different amounts of charge transferred from the substrate to the adsorbed gas molecules. Using the non-equilibrium Green functions in the context of density functional theory, we quantitatively associated these charge transfers with the reduction of the current passing through these scattering regions. These results demonstrate that graphene/h-BN heterostructures can be exploited as highly sensitive and selective room-temperature gas sensors for detecting toxic gases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boron Nitride; Charge Transfer; Chemical Sensors; Density Functional Theory; Energy Gap; Gas Adsorption; Gas Detectors; Gases; Iii-v Semiconductors; Lattice Mismatch; Molecules; Nanosheets; Nitrides; Nitrogen Oxides; Substrates; Toxic Materials; Adsorbed Gas; Adsorption Performance; First-principle Study; Gas Molecules; Gas Sensing Devices; Gas-sensors; Graphene-based Sensors; High Sensitivity; Toxic Gas; Two-dimensional; Graphene","Boron nitride; Charge transfer; Chemical sensors; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Gas adsorption; Gas detectors; Gases; III-V semiconductors; Lattice mismatch; Molecules; Nanosheets; Nitrides; Nitrogen oxides; Substrates; Toxic materials; Adsorbed gas; Adsorption performance; First-principle study; Gas molecules; Gas sensing devices; Gas-sensors; Graphene-based sensors; High sensitivity; Toxic gas; Two-dimensional; Graphene","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the JICA project at VNU Vietnam Japan University for providing the high-performance computing (HPC) resources.","Zhang, Chao, Room temperature conductive type metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors for NO 2 detection, Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, 289, pp. 118-133, (2019); Rong, Qian, Pt Single Atom-Induced Activation Energy and Adsorption Enhancement for an Ultrasensitive ppb-Level Methanol Gas Sensor, ACS Sensors, 7, 1, pp. 199-206, (2022); Chen, Renjie, Highly Dispersive Palladium Loading on ZnO by Galvanic Replacements with Improved Methane Sensing Performance, Chemosensors, 10, 8, (2022); Chen, Dachang, Different doping of penta-graphene as adsorbent and gas sensing material for scavenging and detecting SF 6 decomposed species, Sustainable Materials and Technologies, 21, (2019); Wang, Boran, Gas sensing devices based on two-dimensional materials: A review, Nanotechnology, 33, 25, (2022); Zhang, Jian, A review on two-dimensional materials for chemiresistive- And FET-type gas sensors, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 23, 29, pp. 15420-15439, (2021); Mansouri, Elham, Phosphorene as H2S and CH4 Gas Sensor, Physica Status Solidi (A) Applications and Materials Science, 216, 2, (2019); Phung, Thi Viet Bac, Graphene as a Sensor for Lung Cancer: Insights into Adsorption of VOCs Using vdW DFT, ACS Omega, 9, 2, pp. 2302-2313, (2024); Novoselov, Konstantin Sergeevich, Two-dimensional gas of massless Dirac fermions in graphene, Nature, 438, 7065, pp. 197-200, (2005); Novoselov, Konstantin Sergeevich, Electric field in atomically thin carbon films, Science, 306, 5696, pp. 666-669, (2004)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20462069","","RSCAC","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184662906"

The participants were NCL experts from Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Republic of Korea. Special lectures included the PDMPs self-sufficiency strategies of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Indonesian Food and Drug Authority, and a case study on Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) assessment for vaccines by the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. The NCL delegates shared their current experiences with national lot releases and biological standardisation. The meeting contributed to a mutual understanding of the progress of the PDMPs self-sufficiency among Asian countries, the WHO's support strategies, and the NCL's plan for the preparation of the WHO GBT assessment. In the panel discussion, all participants agreed that building capacity in blood safety in the Asian region and harmonisation of relevant international regulatory requirements will support appropriate emergency preparedness, particularly source materials in the region, and will build the foundation for resolving the PDMPs supply insecurity that has worsened after the COVID-19 pandemic in some countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological Standardization; National Control Laboratory; Plasma-derived Medicinal Product; Self-sufficiency; Vaccine; Biological Product; Vaccine; Conference Paper; Drug Industry; Drug Quality; Drug Safety; Human; Organizational Policy; Quality Control; Standardization; Systems Biology; Workshop; World Health Organization; Asia; Indonesia; Pandemic; South Korea; Humans; Pandemics; Republic Of Korea","biological product; vaccine; Conference Paper; drug industry; drug quality; drug safety; human; organizational policy; quality control; standardization; systems biology; workshop; World Health Organization; Asia; Indonesia; pandemic; South Korea; Humans; Pandemics; Republic of Korea","","","Regarding blood products, there several regulations issued by the Indonesian Food and Drug Authority and Ministry of Health. The regulations issued by the Indonesian Food and Drug Authority focus on GMP guidelines for an establishment of blood transfusion and plasmapheresis centres, whereas blood transfusion unit standards, blood transfusion services, and the administration of plasma fractionation are regulated by the Ministry of Health. The PDMP is a new blood product in Indonesia. Because the source of blood in Indonesia is abundant, some international investors are interested in manufacturing PDMPs in Indonesia. Therefore, NCLBP must be prepared to strengthen control of PDMPs. Similar to vaccines, PDMPs are categorised as high-risk products because they are sourced from human blood. All processes, including blood collection, plasma fractionation, and PDMP manufacturing, must be GMP certified. Both pre- and post-market surveillance should be conducted. Supported by the WHO, a workshop on the quality assurance of blood products was conducted in June 2023. From the workshop, the NCLBP has a wide knowledge of the strategies of PDMP control applied by other NRA from South Korea, Germany, and Australia. After the workshop, the NCLBP created a roadmap for the development of the PDMPs laboratory capacity.The panel discussion was chaired by Dr. In Soo Shin with all meeting participants. Blood and source materials for PDMPs are restricted in cross-border movement; therefore, surplus source materials in LMICs are often discarded rather than used for PDMPs production owing to a lack of plasma fractionation facilities and technology, such as viral validation. However, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries experienced a growing demand driven by the need for immunoglobulins and an overall decline in plasma donations [7]. The WHO established the Action Framework for Blood Products 2020–2023 to support the strengthening of national blood systems in LMICs through the development of guidelines, technical assistance, and education/training. Currently, the Indonesian Food and Drug Authority is promoting the self-sufficiency of PDMPs, and to strengthen NCL capacity, it held a workshop on testing and analysis to assure the quality of blood products in June 2023 with the WHO, inviting experts from the MFDS, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, and Therapeutic Goods Administration. Indonesia is working with Korean PDMPs manufacturers to establish manufacturing facilities and transfer technology, and Mr. Dio Ramondrana expressed interest in the MFDS's safety management of source materials and the NLR system and wanted to cooperate in education/training. In addition, because securing safe blood is important for the manufacture of PDMPs, Indonesia is promoting continuous cooperation with the Korean Red Cross. Dr. Yuyun Siti Maryuningsih suggested that the MFDS could play a significant role in this area, including education/training in Asian countries, in line with that Korea is a WHO Global Training Hub for Biomanufacturing since February 2022. The MFDS agreed with the WHO's suggestion, noting that Korea's commitment to international cooperation in the blood sector could further contribute to regulatory harmonisation in the region. Representatives from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam also agreed with the WHO and MFDS opinions, and Dr. Yuyun Siti Maryuningsih welcomed the promotion of regional cooperation aimed at PDMPs self-sufficiency, planning to report the outcome of this meeting to the Expert Committee on Biological Standardisation (ECBS).In 2022, the United States FDA issued new guidance regarding variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) that eliminates the deferral for those who spent time in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France at certain periods of time [8]. Australia also decided to remove the geographical deferral of blood and plasma donors from the United Kingdom based on a risk model assessment, and discussions are underway in Korea, where source materials are imported from the United States [9]. Currently, the major countries exporting source materials from paid donors are the United States, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, which are responsible for nearly 90% of the total global supply; Asian countries import source materials from these countries [10]. Different blood management standards across countries could lead to management difficulties, an increase in the amount of discarded source materials, shortage of source material supply, price increases, and an increased incidence of look-back. These predicted issues will lead to increased anxiety and distrust of the national blood system among people who use PDMPs as essential medicines. In response, Dr. In Soo Shin suggested that the WHO should take the leadership in standardising vCJD-related donor deferral regulations, as many scientific studies support that the current risk of transmission of vCJD by blood and blood components is negligible [11–13]. Representatives from six countries also agreed on the need for international harmonisation of the standards, and Dr. Yuyun Siti Maryuningsih said that the WHO is monitoring this situation regarding blood safety and vCJD through expert consultations, harmonisation of related regulations is expected, and will try to further discuss this issue on the ECBS, if needed.This meeting was financially supported by the MFDS of the Republic of Korea.","Grazzini, Giuliano, Plasma-derived medicinal products: Demand and clinical use, Blood Transfusion, 11, SUPPL. 4, pp. s2-s5, (2013); Strengers, Paul F.W., Plasma is a strategic resource, Transfusion, 56, 12, pp. 3133-3137, (2016); Global Status Report on Blood Safety and Availability 2021, (2022); de Angelis, Vincenzo, Plasma-derived medicinal products self-sufficiency from national plasma: To what extent?, Blood Transfusion, 11, SUPPL. 4, pp. s132-s137, (2013); Guidance on Increasing Supplies of Plasma Derived Medicinal Products in Low and Middle Income Countries Through Fractionation of Domestic Plasma, (2021); Report on the Annual Global Survey 2020, (2021); International Plasma Collection Practices Project Report Cadth Health Technology Review, (2021); Guidance for Industry Recommendations to Reduce the Possible Risk of Transmission of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease and Variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease by Blood and Blood Components, (2022); Tga Approval to Change Blood Donation Rules Relating to Vcjd Deferral, (2022); Bloody Well Pay Them, (2020)","","Academic Press","","","","","","10958320; 10451056","","BILSE","38428357","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186854535"

The VOCs chosen as adsorbates are ethanol, benzene, and toluene, which are found in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients. The most energetically favorable configurations of the adsorbed systems, adsorption energy profiles, charge transfer, and work function are calculated. The fundamental insight into the interactions between the considered VOC molecules and graphene through molecular doping, i.e., charge transfer, is estimated. It is found that the adsorption energy is highly sensitive to the vdW functionals. Adsorption energies calculated by revPBE-vdW are in good agreement with the available experimental data, and the revPBE-vdW functional can cover well the physical phenomena behind the adsorption of these VOCs on graphene. Bader charge analysis shows that 0.064, 0.042, and 0.061e of charge were transferred from the graphene surface to ethanol, benzene, and toluene, respectively. All of the considered VOCs act as electron acceptors from graphene. By analyzing the electronic structure of the adsorption systems, we found that the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of these considered VOCs is shifted backward toward the Fermi level. The interaction of the VOCs with the π and π* states of the C atoms in graphene breaks the symmetry of graphene, leading to the opening of a band gap at the Fermi level. The adsorption of these considered VOCs onto the pristine graphene produces a band gap of 5-12 meV. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors acknowledge the facility support from the JICA Technical Cooperation project at VNU Vietnam Japan University.","Schnabel, Ronny M., Analysis of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Ego, Amedée, Impact of diagnostic criteria on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, Chest, 147, 2, pp. 347-355, (2015); Boots, Agnes W., The versatile use of exhaled volatile organic compounds in human health and disease, Journal of Breath Research, 6, 2, (2012); Miekisch, Wolfram, Diagnostic potential of breath analysis - Focus on volatile organic compounds, Clinica Chimica Acta, 347, 1-2, pp. 25-39, (2004); Barker, Michael, Volatile organic compounds in the exhaled breath of young patients with cystic fibrosis, European Respiratory Journal, 27, 5, pp. 929-936, (2006); Hakim, Meggie, Volatile organic compounds of lung cancer and possible biochemical pathways, Chemical Reviews, 112, 11, pp. 5949-5966, (2012); Gaspar, E.

Multimetallic MOFs have emerged as excellent materials for several applications; however, it remains a significant challenge to synthesize and characterize these materials. In this work, we report a facile approach to synthesizing a series of multimetallic MOF nanosheet-assembled hierarchical flower-like morphologies as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for natural seawater electrolysis. Simultaneously, their three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures and multimetallic components can provide abundant active sites, improve intrinsic catalytic activity, and facilitate electron transfer. Consequently, the obtained RhCoNi-MOF exhibits overpotentials as low as 40, 48, and 50 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline freshwater, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater. In natural seawater, the RhCoNi-MOF also offers an outstanding performance comparable to Pt/C. Impressively, a two-electrode overall seawater electrolysis device using RhCoNi-MOF as a bifunctional catalyst requires a voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm-2 and can stably maintain over 80 h. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the superior electrocatalytic activity of the RhCoNi-MOF can be attributed to the synergistic effects of introducing Co and Rh metal ions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dft Calculation; Hydrogen Evolution Reaction; Multimetallic Mofs; Overall Seawater Splitting; Seawater Electrolysis; Alkalinity; Catalyst Activity; Chemical Modification; Density Functional Theory; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Metal Ions; Nanosheets; Organometallics; Seawater; Alkalines; Dft Calculation; Hydrogen Evolution Reactions; Industrial Scale; Metallics; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Multimetallic Mof; Overall Seawater Splitting; Seawater Electrolysis; Splittings; Electrocatalysts","Alkalinity; Catalyst activity; Chemical modification; Density functional theory; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Metal ions; Nanosheets; Organometallics; Seawater; Alkalines; DFT calculation; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Industrial scale; Metallics; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Multimetallic MOF; Overall seawater splitting; Seawater electrolysis; Splittings; Electrocatalysts","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM), under grant number A2023-50-01.

However, the self-corrosion of Al remains a huge barrier to hinder their large-scale applications. This study developed a novel hybrid device by merging an Al–air battery and a solid-state hydrocapacitor using a graphene sheet/carbon particles (GSCP) composite anode. A plant fiber layer separated the Al electrode from the poly(vinyl alcohol)/phosphoric acid electrolyte, which could greatly reduce Al self-corrosion. Additionally, the all-solid-state working condition of the device prevented negative leakage or undesirable deformation of the electrolyte when not in use. Moreover, the microporous GSCP electrode was synthesized through a green, cost-effective, and nonhazardous process by compositing exfoliated graphene with micro/nano-sized carbon particles processed from recovered spent battery parts. Remarkably, it could achieve a high-level open-circuit voltage of 1.5 V by simply dropping small-scale water droplets and daily repeating for over a month. Simultaneously, the stored energy was maintained for approximately 2.8 h due to water evaporation. Simply stacking cells in an array could amplify the output to power commercial devices. As a breakthrough, the device successfully operated as a human-breathing transducer. To explain the operational principle, a possible model based on the capillarity, ion diffusion, and streaming potential mechanisms was proposed and discussed comprehensively. This novel hybrid device provides considerable insight for future water-movement-based devices and small portable/wearable electronics and facilitates the development of green energy conversion systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Al–air Battery; Carbon Material; Energy Conversion; Hybrid Energy Device; Hydrocapacitor; Pseudocapacitor; Aluminum Corrosion; Anodes; Drops; Electrolytes; Graphene; Open Circuit Voltage; Polyvinyl Alcohols; Aluminum–air Battery; Carbon Material; Carbon Particle; Energy Devices; Hybrid Devices; Hybrid Energy; Hybrid Energy Device; Hydrocapacitor; Pseudocapacitors; Water Droplets; Cost Effectiveness","Aluminum corrosion; Anodes; Drops; Electrolytes; Graphene; Open circuit voltage; Polyvinyl alcohols; Aluminum–air battery; Carbon material; Carbon particle; Energy devices; Hybrid devices; Hybrid energy; Hybrid energy device; Hydrocapacitor; Pseudocapacitors; Water droplets; Cost effectiveness","","","This work was supported in part by an appointment to the Fujian Minjiang Chair Professor Program (CN) [No 2022(04) ] and Guiding Project of the Department of Science and Technology of Fujian Province (CN) under grant 2022H0048 .","Shah, Arvind Victor, Photovoltaic technology: The case for thin-film solar cells, Science, 285, 5428, pp. 692-698, (1999); Hao, Feng, An alternative alkylpyridinium iodide with high electroactivity for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells, Electrochemistry Communications, 13, 6, pp. 550-553, (2011); Liu, Ruhao, A photocapacitor based on organometal halide perovskite and PANI/CNT composites integrated using a CNT bridge, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 5, 44, pp. 23078-23084, (2017); Tian, Zhengnan, Printable magnesium ion quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors for flexible solar-charging integrated units, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Liu, Ruiyuan, An Efficient Ultra-Flexible Photo-Charging System Integrating Organic Photovoltaics and Supercapacitors, Advanced Energy Materials, 10, 20, (2020); Liu, Kang, Thermal–Electric Nanogenerator Based on the Electrokinetic Effect in Porous Carbon Film, Advanced Energy Materials, 8, 13, (2018); Wang, Zhong Lin, Piezoelectric nanogenerators based on zinc oxide nanowire arrays, Science, 312, 5771, pp. 242-246, (2006); Briscoe, Joe, Piezoelectric nanogenerators - a review of nanostructured piezoelectric energy harvesters, Nano Energy, 14, pp. 15-29, (2014); Zhao, Tianlong, Giant Piezoelectricity of Ternary Perovskite Ceramics at High Temperatures, Advanced Functional Materials, 29, 12, (2019); Fan, Feng Ru, Flexible triboelectric generator, Nano Energy, 1, 2, pp. 328-334, (2012)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180534042"

This study aimed to enhance the mechanical and biological properties of polyurethane (PU) by incorporating magnesium chloride (MgCl<inf>2</inf>) into the patch. Methodology: The composite patch was fabricated using the electrospinning technique, producing nanofibers from a mixture of PU and MgCl<inf>2</inf> solutions. The electrospun PU/MgCl<inf>2</inf> was then evaluated for various physico-chemical characteristics and biological properties to determine its suitability for wound healing applications. Results: Tensile strength testing showed that the mechanical properties of the composite patch (10.98 ± 0.18) were significantly improved compared to pristine PU (6.66 ± 0.44). Field scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed that the electrospun nanofiber patch had a smooth, randomly oriented non-woven structure (PU – 830 ± 145 nm and PU/MgCl<inf>2</inf> – 508 ± 151 nm). Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed magnesium chloride’s presence in the polyurethane matrix via strong hydrogen bond formation. Blood compatibility studies using coagulation assays, including activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and hemolysis assays, demonstrated improved blood compatibility of the composite patch (APTT – 174 ± 0.5 s, PT – 91 ± 0.8s, and Hemolytic percentage – 1.78%) compared to pristine PU (APTT – 152 ± 1.2s, PT – 73 ± 1.7s, and Hemolytic percentage – 2.55%). Antimicrobial testing showed an enhanced zone of inhibition (Staphylococcus aureus – 21.5 ± 0.5 mm and Escherichia coli – 27.5 ± 2.5 mm) compared to the control, while cell viability assays confirmed the non-cytotoxic nature of the developed patches on fibroblast cells. Conclusion: The study concludes that adding MgCl<inf>2</inf> to PU significantly improves the mechanical, biological, and biocompatibility properties of the patch. This composite patch shows potential for future wound healing applications, with further studies needed to validate its efficacy in-vivo. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomaterial; Mgcl2; Nanofibers; Polyurethane; Wound Dressings; Magnesium Chloride; Polyurethan; Anti-bacterial Agents; Biocompatible Materials; Magnesium Chloride; Polyurethanes; Ai-3000; Hitachi Su8020; Nanowizard; Biomaterial; Magnesium Chloride; Nanofiber; Polyurethane Nanofiber Patch; Unclassified Drug; Antiinfective Agent; Polyurethan; Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time; Antimicrobial Activity; Article; Atomic Force Microscopy; Biocompatibility; Cell Viability; Clinical Evaluation; Controlled Study; Electrospinning; Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy; Escherichia Coli; Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Hemolysis Assay; Human; Human Cell; Hydrogen Bond; Prothrombin Time; Staphylococcus Aureus; Surface Property; Tensile Strength; Tissue Engineering; Wound Healing; Animal; Bandage; Chemistry; Drug Effect; Hemolysis; Materials Testing; Mouse; Animals; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bandages; Biocompatible Materials; Hemolysis; Humans; Magnesium Chloride; Materials Testing; Mice; Nanofibers; Polyurethanes; Tensile Strength; Wound Healing","biomaterial; magnesium chloride; nanofiber; polyurethane nanofiber patch; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; polyurethan; activated partial thromboplastin time; antimicrobial activity; Article; atomic force microscopy; biocompatibility; cell viability; clinical evaluation; controlled study; electrospinning; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Escherichia coli; field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; hemolysis assay; human; human cell; hydrogen bond; prothrombin time; Staphylococcus aureus; surface property; tensile strength; tissue engineering; wound healing; animal; bandage; chemistry; drug effect; hemolysis; materials testing; mouse; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bandages; Biocompatible Materials; Hemolysis; Humans; Magnesium Chloride; Materials Testing; Mice; Nanofibers; Polyurethanes; Tensile Strength; Wound Healing","","magnesium chloride, 7786-30-3, 7791-18-6; polyurethan, 61789-63-7; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biocompatible Materials; Magnesium Chloride; Polyurethanes","","Mofazzal Jahromi, Mirza Ali, Nanomedicine and advanced technologies for burns: Preventing infection and facilitating wound healing, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 123, pp. 33-64, (2018); Jeschke, Marc Gerhard, Burn injury, Nature Reviews Disease Primers, 6, 1, (2020); Portela, Raquel P., Bacterial cellulose: a versatile biopolymer for wound dressing applications, Microbial Biotechnology, 12, 4, pp. 586-610, (2019); Wendels, Sophie, Biobased polyurethanes for biomedical applications, Bioactive Materials, 6, 4, pp. 1083-1106, (2021); Asadi, Nahideh, Common biocompatible polymeric materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 242, (2020); Das, Abhijit, A brief discussion on advances in polyurethane applications, Advanced Industrial and Engineering Polymer Research, 3, 3, pp. 93-101, (2020); Marzec, Michalina, Development of polyurethanes for bone repair, Materials Science and Engineering C, 80, pp. 736-747, (2017); Afsharian, Yasamin Pesaran, Bioactive electrospun scaffolds for wound healing applications: A comprehensive review, Polymer Testing, 93, (2021); Zhang, Wen, Responsive multifunctional hydrogels emulating the chronic wounds healing cascade for skin repair, Journal of Controlled Release, 354, pp. 821-834, (2023); Xie, Xiaofei, Antibacterial hydrogel with pH-responsive microcarriers of slow-release VEGF for bacterial infected wounds repair, Journal of Materials Science and Technology, 144, pp. 198-212, (2023)","","Dove Medical Press Ltd","","","","","","11769114; 11782013","","","39502632","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208603526"

Specifically, we propose an advanced preparation and characterization of an electrospun Polyurethane/Calcium Chloride (PU/CaCl<inf>2</inf>) nanocomposite scaffold, devised to boost the scaffold’s physicochemical and biological properties for skin tissue regeneration. By incorporating CaCl<inf>2</inf> into the PU matrix using an electrospinning process, we were able to fabricate a novel nanocomposite scaffold. The morphological examination through Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) revealed that the fiber diameter of the PU/CaCl2 (563 ± 147 nm) scaffold was notably smaller compared to the control (784 ± 149 nm). The presence of CaCl<inf>2</inf> in the PU matrix was corroborated by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Furthermore, the PU/CaCl<inf>2</inf> scaffold exhibited superior tensile strength (10.81 MPa) over pristine PU (Tensile −6.16 MPa, Contact angle - 109° ± 1° and Roughness - 854 ± 32 nm) and revealed enhanced wettability (72° ± 2°) and reduced surface roughness (274 ± 104 nm), as verified by Contact angle and Atomic Force Microscopy. The developed scaffold demonstrated improved anticoagulant properties, indicating its potential for successful integration within a biological environment. The improved properties of the PU/CaCl<inf>2</inf> nanocomposite scaffold present a significant advancement in electrospun polymer nanofibers, offering a potential breakthrough in skin tissue engineering. However, additional studies are required to thoroughly evaluate the scaffold’s effectiveness in promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. We aim to catalyze significant advancements in the field by revealing the creation of a potent skin scaffold leveraging electrospun nanofibers.

In this study, the mechanical properties of Acacia mangium (black wattle) wood were predicted by using stress wave and ultrasonic wave methods. The values of dynamic modulus of elasticity based on stress wave and ultrasonic wave were 9,29 % and 4,75 % higher than those obtained from static modulus of elasticity, respectively. There was no statistically significant correlation between acoustic velocity and mechanical properties measured by destructive tests. The strong experimental correlation coefficients were found between stress wave and modulus of elasticity (r = 0,94; P < 0,001), and ultrasonic wave and modulus of elasticity (r = 0,83; P < 0,001). This result indicates that stress wave and ultrasonic wave techniques are suitable for predicting the static modulus of elasticity of Acacia mangium (black wattle) wood if the density of the measured elements is known. There was no dependence of wood density and acoustic propagation velocity measured in this study, whereas statistically significant correlations were found between the fiber length with stress wave velocity (r = 0,44; P < 0,05) and ultrasonic velocity (r = 0,48; P < 0,05). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acacia Mangium; Dynamic Moe; Fiber Length; Static Bending; Stress Wave; Ultrasound","","","","We thank Dr. Tran Lam Dong and his research group from the Vietnamese Academy of Forest Sciences for supporting collection sample trees in this study.","Baar, Jan, The influence of wood density on longitudinal wave velocity determined by the ultrasound method in comparison to the resonance longitudinal method, European Journal of Wood and Wood Products, 70, 5, pp. 767-769, (2012); Tippner, Jan, The relation of fibre length and ray dimensions to sound propagation velocity in wood of selected tropical hardwoods, IAWA Journal, 34, 1, pp. 49-60, (2013); Baar, Jan, Prediction of mechanical properties - modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity - of five tropical species by nondestructive methods, Maderas: Ciencia y Tecnologia, 17, 2, pp. 239-252, (2015); Barrett, J.

We find that the HB monolayer has anisotropic mechanical properties. The Young’s modulus of the HB monolayer is 222.73 (N/m) and 155 (N/m) along the x and y directions, respectively. The ideal strength of the HB monolayer along the x direction (21.23 N/m) is higher than that along the y direction (13.79 N/m). Moreover, our obtained results demonstrate that the HB monolayer is an indirect bandgap semiconductor at the equilibrium state, with a bandgap of 3.45 eV. We find that an indirect to direct bandgap semiconductor transition occurs at the strain of 12% along the x direction. The results presented in this study elucidate the intrinsic properties of HB monolayer under the tensile strain, which are useful for making devices based on HB monolayer. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ab-initio Calculations; Electronic Property; Hydrogenated-biphenylene; Ideal Strength; Energy Gap; Hydrogenation; Monolayers; Tensile Strain; Ab Initio Calculations; Anisotropic Mechanical Properties; Band-gap Semiconductors; Biphenylene; Equilibrium State; Hydrogenated-biphenylene; Ideal Strength; Indirect Bandgap Semiconductors; Mechanical And Electronic Properties; Semiconductor Transition; Electronic Properties","Energy gap; Hydrogenation; Monolayers; Tensile strain; Ab initio calculations; Anisotropic mechanical properties; Band-gap semiconductors; Biphenylene; Equilibrium state; Hydrogenated-biphenylene; Ideal strength; Indirect bandgap semiconductors; Mechanical and electronic properties; Semiconductor transition; Electronic properties","","","","Novoselov, Konstantin Sergeevich, Electric field in atomically thin carbon films, Science, 306, 5696, pp. 666-669, (2004); Katsnelson, Mikhail I., Chiral tunnelling and the Klein paradox in graphene, Nature Physics, 2, 9, pp. 620-625, (2006); Nanoscience and Technology A Collection of Reviews from Nature Journals, (2010); Rao, Chintamani Nagesa Ramachandra, Graphene: The new two-dimensional nanomaterial, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 48, 42, pp. 7752-7777, (2009); Tuan Hung, Nguyen, Intrinsic strength and failure behaviors of ultra-small single-walled carbon nanotubes, Computational Materials Science, 114, pp. 167-171, (2016); Bolotin, Kirill I., Ultrahigh electron mobility in suspended graphene, Solid State Communications, 146, 9-10, pp. 351-355, (2008); Balandin, Alexander A., Thermal properties of graphene and nanostructured carbon materials, Nature Materials, 10, 8, pp. 569-581, (2011); van Thanh, Vuong, Charge-induced electromechanical actuation of two-dimensional hexagonal and pentagonal materials, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 21, 40, pp. 22377-22384, (2019); Xia, Fengnian, Graphene field-effect transistors with high on/off current ratio and large transport band gap at room temperature, Nano Letters, 10, 2, pp. 715-718, (2010); Veeravenkata, Harish P., Density functional theory driven phononic thermal conductivity prediction of biphenylene: A comparison with graphene, Carbon, 183, pp. 893-898, (2021)","Long, B.T.; Ishizaki, K.; Kim, H.S.; Kim, Y.-H.; Toan, N.D.; Minh, N.T.H.; Duc An, P.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","3rd International Annual Conference on Material, Machines and Methods for Sustainable Development, MMMS 2022","","Can Tho","310249","21954364; 21954356","9789819650583; 9783031991585; 9783031948886; 9789819667314; 9789811937156; 9783030703318; 9789811622779; 9789811969447; 9789819701056; 9789819748051","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190252135"

The existing design has several limitations, including poor mass-transfer efficiency and uneven distribution of dissolved ozone. To address these issues, the optimized design includes new injection-point settings and an increased number of diffusers. The optimized design achieved a significant improvement in mass transfer efficiency. The ozone treatment effectively reduced the total coliform counts in the wastewater samples compared to the existing design.

To ensure the safety of aquatic wildlife, it is essential to determine the toxicity of these antibiotics and establish appropriate concentration limits. Additionally, in (eco)toxicological studies, addressing the issue of multiple hypothesis testing through p-value adjustments is crucial for robust decision-making. In this study, we assessed the no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of CFX and OFX on Moina macrocopa across a concentration range of 0–400 µg L−1. Furthermore, we investigated multiple p-value adjustments to determine the NOAECs. Our analysis yielded consistent results across seven different p-value adjustments, indicating NOAECs of 100 µg CFX L−1 for age at first reproduction and 200 µg CFX L−1 for fertility. For OFX treatment, a NOAEC of 400 µg L−1 was observed for both biomarkers. However, further investigation is required to establish the NOAEC of OFX at higher concentrations with greater certainty. Our findings demonstrate that CFX exhibits higher toxicity compared to OFX, consistent with previous research. Moreover, this study highlights the differential performance of p-value adjustment methods in terms of maintaining statistical power while controlling the multiplicity problem, and their practical applicability. The study emphasizes the low NOAECs for these antibiotics in the zooplanktonic group, highlighting their significant risks to ecological and environmental safety. Additionally, our investigation of p-value adjustment approaches contributes to a deeper understanding of their performance characteristics, enabling (eco)toxicologists to select appropriate methods based on their specific needs and priorities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibiotic Pollution; Fluoroquinolones; Multiple Comparisons Problem; Noaec; Non-target Organism; Ciprofloxacin; Ofloxacin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Ofloxacin; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Ciprofloxacin; Ofloxacin; Antiinfective Agent; Antibiotic Therapy; Article; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Ecotoxicity; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Risk; Explanatory Variable; Fertility; Mathematical Model; Moina Macrocopa; No-observed-adverse-effect Concentration; Nonhuman; Reproduction; Response Variable; Statistical Model; Statistical Significance; Toxicity Testing; Type I Error; Zooplankton; Animal; Cladocera; Dose Response; Drug Effect; Female; No-observed-adverse-effect Level; Toxicity; Water Pollutant; Animals; Anti-bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Dose-response Relationship, Drug; Female; Fertility; No-observed-adverse-effect Level; Ofloxacin; Reproduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical","ciprofloxacin; ofloxacin; antiinfective agent; antibiotic therapy; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; environmental risk; explanatory variable; fertility; mathematical model; Moina macrocopa; no-observed-adverse-effect concentration; nonhuman; reproduction; response variable; statistical model; statistical significance; toxicity testing; type I error; zooplankton; animal; Cladocera; dose response; drug effect; female; no-observed-adverse-effect level; toxicity; water pollutant; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Fertility; No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level; Ofloxacin; Reproduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1, 86393-32-0, 128074-72-6, 128074-76-0, 192934-52-4, 93107-08-5, 86483-48-9, 96186-80-0; ofloxacin, 82419-36-1; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Ofloxacin; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number: 20K20640), Japan, and Nagasaki University WISE Programme Research, Japan.

This chapter introduces the down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) technology, which has been successfully applied and considered the optimal solution for wastewater treatment in many developing countries. With outstanding features in regard to energy and cost-savings, as well as ease of operation and disassembly, DHS technology has made significant strides in its development since its concept was first introduced in 1995. This is not only for the main applications related to nitrogen and organic matter removals but the DHS technology has also been successfully applied in dye treatment or methane recovery from anaerobic effluent. So far, this technology has fulfilled its role as a posttreatment followed by another anaerobic treatment system or as a single treatment reactor for various types, such as industrial wastewater, agriculture wastewater, or aquaculture water. In this chapter, an overview of DHS technology, including its development history, worldwide expansion, treatment performance, and prospects, is introduced. In addition, the possible mechanisms are also proposed by generalizing the presence and distribution of the microbial system discovered in the DHS system. The authors hope this chapter provides a close and easy-to-understand view of such unique and useful technology, thereby contributing to pervasive technology, eliciting more innovations to optimize technology and bring clean water solutions to mankind. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Down-flow Hanging Sponge Technology; Nitrogen Removal; Organic Removal; Posttreatment Process; Sponge Carriers; Trickling Filter Mechanism","","","","","Adlin, Nur, A nitrogen removal system to limit water exchange for recirculating freshwater aquarium using DHS–USB reactor, Environmental Technology (United Kingdom), 39, 12, pp. 1577-1585, (2018); Agrawal, Lalit K., Treatment of raw sewage in a temperate climate using a UASB reactor and the hanging sponge cubes process, Water Science and Technology, 36, 6-7, pp. 433-440, (1997); Ahammad, Shaikh Ziauddin, Low-energy treatment of colourant wastes using sponge biofilters for the personal care product industry, Bioresource Technology, 129, pp. 634-638, (2013); Ali, Manal, Potential of using non-inoculated self-aerated immobilized biomass reactor for post-treatment of upflow anaerobic staged reactor treating high strength industrial wastewater, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 92, 5, pp. 1065-1075, (2017); Araki, Nobuo, Behaviors of nitrifiers in a novel biofilm reactor employing hanging sponge-cubes as attachment site, Water Science and Technology, 39, 7, pp. 23-31, (1999); Asano, Kenya, Development of UASB–DHS system for anaerobically-treated tofu processing wastewater treatment under ambient temperature, Environmental Technology (United Kingdom), 43, 25, pp. 3973-3982, (2022); Bansal, Neeru K., Industrial Development and Challenges of Water Pollution in Coastal Areas: The Case of Surat, India, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 120, 1, (2018); Bijekar, Sangha, The State of the Art and Emerging Trends in the Wastewater Treatment in Developing Nations, Water (Switzerland), 14, 16, (2022); Campos-Gomez, Jose Luis, Nitrogen and Phosphorus Recovery From Anaerobically Pretreated Agro-Food Wastes: A Review, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 2, (2019); Carrard, Naomi, Groundwater as a source of drinking water in southeast Asia and the Pacific: A multi-country review of current reliance and resource concerns, Water (Switzerland), 11, 8, (2019)","","Elsevier","","","","","","","9780443236624; 9780443236617","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002207743"

In the previous four to five decades, using membrane techniques has been seen as a solid way to improve water purification, especially from unconventional sources. Due to the low energy needs for filtering operation, gravity-driven membrane (GDM) techniques have recently been suggested as a sustainable option for water treatment for over 10years. The technology is characterized not only by relatively lower transmembrane pressures which can be achieved by gravity (extremely low energy consumption) but also by the economic benefits in several aspects. In this chapter, the authors propose a review of the GDM process with a focus on energy consumption as well as economic assessment in consideration of the technological aspects. Firstly, the fundamental of GDM is comprehensively described. The factors affecting the performance of GDM are presented and discussed.

Furthermore, only CO<inf>2</inf> gas is emitted during synthesis. We also employed first-principles simulations to evaluate the crystallinity of the synthesized materials via X-ray diffractometer patterns. During charge/discharge processes, the obtained cathode materials induce outstanding electrochemical performance with a maximum specific capacity of up to 206.9 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C and a retention capacity of 83.22% after 100 cycles. Thus, the simple, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and highly electrochemical performance of the newly acquired material envisages the modified coprecipitation method as a promising tool to manufacture cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam Russia Tropical Science and Technology Research Center.

However, real engineering structures often have to work under various loading conditions. Approaches addressing multiple-loading conditions often necessitate subjective input in order to determine the importance of each loading condition, aiming for a compromise between them. This paper proposes a so-called bisection constraint method (BCM), offering a unique, user-preference-independent solution for TO problems amidst multiple-loading conditions. It is well-known that minimizing the system’s compliance is commonly used in TO as the objective. Generally, compliance is not as sufficient as stress to be used as a response to evaluate the performance of structures. However, formulations focusing on minimizing stress levels usually pose significant difficulties and instabilities. On the other hand, the compliance approach is generally simpler and more capable of providing relatively sturdy designs. Hence, the formulation of min–max compliance is used as the target problem formulation of the proposed method. This method attempts to minimize compliance under only one loading condition while compliances under the remaining loading conditions are constrained. During the optimization process, the optimization problem is automatically reformulated with a new objective function and a new set of constraint functions. The role of compliance under different loading conditions, i.e., whether it is to be treated as an objective or constraint function, might be changed throughout the optimization process until convergence. Several examples based on the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach were conducted to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. Furthermore, the general effectiveness of the compliance approach in terms of stress levels is also discussed. The calculation results demonstrated that while the compliance approach is effective in several cases, it proves ineffective in certain scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Epsilon Constraint; Min–max Compliance; Multi-objective Optimization; Multiple-loading Conditions; Simp Approach; Topology Optimization","","","","","Topology Optimization Theory Methods and Applications, (2003); Bendsøe, Martin Philip, Generating optimal topologies in structural design using a homogenization method, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 71, 2, pp. 197-224, (1988); Suzuki, Katsuyuki, A homogenization method for shape and topology optimization, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 93, 3, pp. 291-318, (1991); Torigaki, Toshikazu, Development and application of a shape-topology optimization system using a homogenization method, SAE Technical Papers, (1994); Allaire, Grégoire, The homogenization method for topology and shape optimization.

In this study, DFT calculations were performed on four models with different twist angles. We chose angles of 21.8°, 17.9°, 13.2°, and 5.1° to estimate the dependence of the electronic and phononic properties on the twist angle. The results show that the band gap of bilayer SiC can be changed proportionally by changing the twist angle. However, there are only small variations in the band gaps, with an increment of 0.24 eV by changing the twist angle from 5.1° to 21.8°. At four considered twist angles, the band gaps decrease significantly when fixing the structure of each layer and pressing the separation distance down to 3.5 Å, 3.0 Å, 2.7 Å, and 2.5 Å. A noteworthy point is that the pressing also makes the band linearly smaller at a certain rate regardless of the twist angles. Meanwhile, the phonon bands are not affected by the value of the twist angle. The optical bands are between 900 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1 and the acoustic bands are between 0 cm−1 and 650 cm−1 at four twist angles. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Gap; Bi-layer; Bilayer Systems; Dft Calculation; Potential Materials; Pressung; Property; Small Variations; Twist Angles; Twisted Bilayers; Two-dimensional Structures; Silicon Carbide","Energy gap; Bi-layer; Bilayer systems; DFT calculation; Potential materials; Pressung; Property; Small variations; Twist angles; Twisted bilayers; Two-dimensional structures; Silicon carbide","","","We acknowledge Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for supporting this study.

The immediate loading of implants yields comparable effects on the patient-reported outcomes compared to conventional loading. Comprehensive, long-term studies on patient-reported outcomes for two-implant overdentures with magnetic attachments using immediate or conventional loading methods are lacking. This study aimed to provide 5-year follow-up data comparing patient-reported outcomes for mandibular overdentures supported by two implants with magnetic attachments under immediate or conventional loading. Nineteen edentulous mandible patients were randomly assigned to immediate (IG) or conventional loading groups (CG). Two implants were placed with prostheses, loaded on the same day (immediate) or three months later (conventional). Participants completed questionnaires (oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), patient general satisfaction, and patient’s denture assessment (PDA)) at baseline and yearly intervals for 5 years. Results showed no significant differences between IG and CG throughout the study. However, the within-group analysis revealed significant improvements in OHRQoL, patient satisfaction, and all PDA domains from the baseline to years 1–5. Regarding patient satisfaction, significant differences were observed between T1, T2, and T3 when compared with T0 of IG and T1-T0 of CG. Regarding PDA results of T4-T5, IG exhibited several significant differences compared to CG. In conclusion, this study suggests that two-implant overdentures with magnetic attachments, whether immediately or conventionally loaded, improve patient-reported outcomes. Immediate loading may have prolonged effects on the improvement of patient-reported outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Immediate Loading; Implant; Magnetic Attachment; Overdenture; Patient Satisfaction; Quality Of Life","","","","This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number 25462986.","Feine, Jocelyne S., The McGill consensus statement on overdentures.

These conveyors, enclosed within troughs or cylindrical bodies, effectively mitigate environmental contamination and material toxicity during transit. Their hermetic design prevents material dispersion by wind, thereby minimizing losses and preserving the integrity of raw materials, particularly those with potential health implications such as urea and cement. Consequently, employing a screw conveyor constitutes a prudent safety measure. Despite the widespread use of screw conveyors, a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of material particles within these systems remains elusive and subject to discrepancies across various methodologies. Presently, a multitude of calculation methods and applications exist, resulting in disparities between theoretical computations and practical implementation. Drawing upon Alan W. Roberts’ meticulously devised calculation methodology, renowned for its precision, the authors have developed a swift computational tool utilizing VBA Excel software 2023. Additionally, EDEM simulation software was employed to model granular material behavior. The ensuing calculations guided the selection of optimized technical dimensions for the screw conveyor, which were then fabricated and subjected to real-world testing at the Vinh Tan thermal power plant. Remarkably, the achieved output capacity demonstrated a mere 7% deviation from calculations performed with the VBA program and a 2% variation from those conducted via EDEM simulation. Furthermore, a comprehensive graph depicting the relationship between screw conveyor speed and capacity has been provided, affording a means to finely tune throughput with exceptional accuracy along the production line. The results obtained provide the basis for the development of a device that meets the required capacity specifications accurately and precisely on the first attempt. This accomplishment satisfies stringent capacity standards without the need for any adjustments or modifications, all while ensuring minimal cost and time efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fly Ash; Granular Material; Numerical Simulation; Screw Conveyor; Screw Fly Ash Conveyor","","","","The School of Mechanical Engineering, Hanoi University of Science and Technology and Vinh Tan Thermal Power Company are gratefully acknowledged for providing support and conditions to carry out this research.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Myocardial function and arrhythmogenesis are closely linked to calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. We investigated the effects of a KD on Ca2+ homeostasis and electrophysiology in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Male Wistar rats were created to have diabetes mellitus (DM) using streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and subsequently treated for 6 weeks with either a normal diet (ND) or a KD. Our electrophysiological and Western blot analyses assessed myocardial Ca2+ homeostasis in ventricular preparations in vivo. Unlike those on the KD, DM rats treated with an ND exhibited a prolonged QTc interval and action potential duration. Compared to the control and DM rats on the KD, DM rats treated with an ND also showed lower intracellular Ca2+ transients, sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ content, sodium (Na+)-Ca2+ exchanger currents (reverse mode), L-type Ca2+ contents, sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase contents, Cav1.2 contents. Furthermore, these rats exhibited elevated ratios of phosphorylated to total proteins across multiple Ca2+ handling proteins, including ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) at serine 2808, phospholamban (PLB)-Ser16, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Additionally, DM rats treated with an ND demonstrated a higher frequency and incidence of Ca2+ leak, cytosolic reactive oxygen species, Na+/hydrogen-exchanger currents, and late Na+ currents than the control and DM rats on the KD. KD treatment may attenuate the effects of DM-dysregulated Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis, contributing to its cardioprotection in DM. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arrhythmias; Calcium Homeostasis;

Ex situ MgB<inf>2</inf> samples were further mixed with Mg and B at different amounts and sintered at different times and temperatures. Using Raman spectroscopy, the bearing of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling (EPC) has been investigated. The dependence of temperature on magnetization, M(T), along with the dependence of magnetic field on magnetization, M(H), were evaluated to analyze the superconducting characteristics. Using the McMillan formular, which is modified by Allen–Dynes, and the frequency of phonon located in the mid peak centre ω<inf>2</inf> (E<inf>2g</inf>), the contribution of EPC, whose value is closely proportional to the variation of critical temperature was reckoned. The lowest EPC value was determined by Raman spectrum analysis to be 1.094 for the MgB<inf>2</inf> sample added with 0.5 Mg and sintered at 1000 °C for 1 h. In addition, the sample showed the lowest critical temperature along with the highest critical current density. The small bundle field (B<inf>sb</inf>) as well as the large bundle field (B<inf>lb</inf>) were obtained using the collective pinning theory, demonstrating the expansion of the small also the large bundle regimes under suitable sample fabrication conditions. Based on the dependence of temperature on normalized critical current density (j) and normalized small bundle field (B<inf>sb</inf>), δT<inf>c</inf> pinning is the predominant flux pinning mechanism across totally MgB<inf>2</inf> bulk samples.

Several different methods based on different principles have been developed to trace the nitroaromatic compound such as the 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) compound. Recently, explosive detecting sensors based on organic conjugated fluorescent materials have been one of the most emerging subjects due to their reliable detection methods as well as portable lightweight instruments. This work uses two novel red fluorescent conjugated polymers, poly(PHP-alt-3HT) and poly(PHP-r-3HT-r-BTz), based on N-peryleneyl phenoxazine (PHP) and 3-hexyl thiophene (3HT), and benzotriazole (BTz) was successfully synthesized via an aerobic condition by direct arylation polycondensation. The red-fluorescent chemosensor based on novel conjugated polymers performed a high sensitivity for TNT detection with fast response time and good selectivity compared to common interferences. Besides tracing of TNT in the solution phase, the polymers also reached significant fluorescence quenching in the solid state by testing on a paper strip with the detection of up to 10−12 M concentrations of TNT. Further, the TNT vapor detection experiment is also effective with the fluorescence changes after only 1 min. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerobic Condition; Direct Arylation Polycondensation; Fluorescent Conjugated Polymer; Paper Sensor; Tnt Explosives Detection; Aromatic Compounds; Conjugated Polymers; Explosives; Fluorescence Quenching; Polycondensation; Sustainable Development; 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene Explosive Detection; Aerobic Condition; Benzotriazoles; Direct Arylation Polycondensation; Explosive Detection; Fluorescent Conjugated Polymers; Paper Sensor; Phenoxazines; Rapid Response; Red Fluorescent; Explosives Detection; Aromatic Compounds; Detection; Fluorescence; Methods; Polymers; Selectivity","Aromatic compounds; Conjugated polymers; Explosives; Fluorescence quenching; Polycondensation; Sustainable development; 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene explosive detection; Aerobic condition; Benzotriazoles; Direct arylation polycondensation; Explosive Detection; Fluorescent conjugated polymers; Paper sensor; Phenoxazines; Rapid response; Red fluorescent; Explosives detection; Aromatic Compounds; Detection; Fluorescence; Methods; Polymers; Selectivity","","","This research is supported by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number 562-2022-20-02 .","Germain, Meaghan E., Optical explosives detection: From color changes to fluorescence turn-on, Chemical Society Reviews, 38, 9, pp. 2543-2555, (2009); Lu, Wei, Self-Diffusion Driven Ultrafast Detection of ppm-Level Nitroaromatic Pollutants in Aqueous Media Using a Hydrophilic Fluorescent Paper Sensor, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 9, 28, pp. 23884-23893, (2017); Ju, Kousan, Nitroaromatic compounds, from synthesis to biodegradation, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 74, 2, pp. 250-272, (2010); Singh, Deepak, Biomineralization of 3-nitrotoluene by Diaphorobacter species, Biodegradation, 24, 5, pp. 645-655, (2013); Teich, Monique, Contributions of nitrated aromatic compounds to the light absorption of water-soluble and particulate brown carbon in different atmospheric environments in Germany and China, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 17, 3, pp. 1653-1672, (2017); Farrakhan-Gooch, Aminah, A quantum chemical based toxicity study of estimated reduction potential and hydrophobicity in series of nitroaromatic compounds, SAR and QSAR in Environmental Research, 28, 2, pp. 133-150, (2017); Hao, Yuxing, Prediction on the mutagenicity of nitroaromatic compounds using quantum chemistry descriptors based QSAR and machine learning derived classification methods, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 186, (2019); Global Nest, (2000); Zhao, Yihuan, Chemometrics-enhanced high performance liquid chromatography strategy for simultaneous determination on seven nitroaromatic compounds in environmental water, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 174, pp. 149-155, (2018); Zhang, Hongxia, Electrochemical sensor for detecting ultratrace nitroaromatic compounds using mesoporous SiO2-modified electrode, Analytical Chemistry, 78, 6, pp. 1967-1971, (2006)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18733743; 01437208","","DYPID","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167573132"

In this study, a spinel nickel–manganese cobaltite (s-NMC) material was synthesized by facile hydrothermal/calcination route and the material exhibited remarkable pseudocapacitive behavior performance. The synthesized s-NMC material had a specific capacitance of 418.3 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (216.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and retained 95% of its specific capacitance after 5000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. These excellent electrochemical properties are attributed to the simultaneous presence of three transition metals in the s-NMC material. The asymmetric supercapacitor device using s-NMC delivered a maximum specific energy density of 16.58 Wh kg−1 at a specific power density of 825 W kg−1 and maintains of ∼97% specific capacitance after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1.

This is necessary for tasks such as obstacle avoidance, navigation, and spatial mapping. By utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), existing works in stereo cameras based on depth estimation have achieved superior results. However, the critical requirement for depth estimation for mobile robots is to have an optimal tradeoff between computational cost and accuracy. To achieve such a tradeoff, attention-aware feature aggregation (AAFS) has been proposed for real-time stereo matching on edge devices. AAFS includes multistage feature extraction, an attention module, and a 3D CNN architecture. However, its 3D CNN architecture learns contextual information ineffectively. In this paper, a deep encoder–decoder architecture is applied to an AAFS 3D CNN to improve depth estimation accuracy. Through evaluation, it is proven that the proposed 3D CNN architecture provides significantly better accuracy while keeping the inference time comparable to that of AAFS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Depth Estimation; Mobile Robots; Stereo Camera","","","","","Campbell, Sean, Path Planning Techniques for Mobile Robots A Review, pp. 12-16, (2020); Vasic, Milos, Safety issues in human-robot interactions, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 197-204, (2013); Wei, Boyu, Indoor mobile robot obstacle detection based on linear structured light vision system, pp. 834-839, (2009); Amigoni, Francesco, An information-based exploration strategy for environment mapping with mobile robots, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 58, 5, pp. 684-699, (2010); Ekvall, Staffan, Integrating active mobile robot object recognition and SLAM in natural environments, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5792-5797, (2006); Murray, Don R., Using real-time stereo vision for mobile robot navigation, Autonomous Robots, 8, 2, pp. 161-171, (2000); Scharstein, Daniel, A taxonomy and evaluation of dense two-frame stereo correspondence algorithms, pp. 131-140, (2001); Flynn, John, Deep stereo: Learning to predict new views from the world's imagery, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 5515-5524, (2016); Kendall, Alex, End-to-End Learning of Geometry and Context for Deep Stereo Regression, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017-October, pp. 66-75, (2017); Chang, Jiaren, Pyramid Stereo Matching Network, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5410-5418, (2018)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174205479"

To address this, a new in-situ gel has been proposed, which is formed in coal pores from a fire-prevention aqueous solution (FPAS) that reacts with atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf>. To determine the appropriate concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium-metasilicate nonahydrate (SN) for FPAS, 24 groups of wire-mesh basket tests were conducted on Baiyinhua coal. The gelling mechanism and performance on fire inhibition of FPAS were then investigated using temperature-programmed tests, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, fourier transform infrared tests, thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis tests, and fire-extinguishing tests. The results indicate an inhibition rate of up to 43.3% and effective protection of active groups from oxidation. The in-situ gel demonstrated excellent fire-extinguishing properties. Additionally, the self-ignition temperatures of residual coals with varying thicknesses were estimated using the Frank-Kamenetskii theory. The combined method of CO<inf>2</inf> injection and FPAS spraying is recommended for achieving better fire-prevention effectiveness in coal mine gob. The findings are expected to provide guidance on the application of FPAS to address thermal hazards in coal mines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Dioxide; Coal; In-situ Gel; Spontaneous Combustion; Coal; Coal Combustion; Coal Mines; Differential Thermal Analysis; Fire Extinguishers; Fireproofing; Fires; Mining; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Sodium Compounds; Spontaneous Combustion; Thermogravimetric Analysis; Case-studies; Coal Pores; Coal Spontaneous Combustion; Complex Solution; Fire Prevention; Fire-extinguishing; In-situ Gel; Situ Gels; Thermal Engineering; Underground Coal Mining; Carbon Dioxide","Coal; Coal combustion; Coal mines; Differential thermal analysis; Fire extinguishers; Fireproofing; Fires; Mining; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium compounds; Spontaneous combustion; Thermogravimetric analysis; Case-studies; Coal pores; Coal spontaneous combustion; Complex solution; Fire prevention; Fire-extinguishing; In-situ gel; Situ gels; Thermal engineering; Underground coal mining; Carbon dioxide","","","This research was supported by the State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base for Gas Geology and Gas Control (Henan Polytechnic University) [Grant number WS2022B09 ]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [Grant number 2022-MS-396 ]; Scientific research project of Education Department of Liaoning Province [Grant number LJKMZ20220667 ]; Excellent Youth Fund Project of Liaoning Natural Science Foundation [ Grant number 2023JH3/10200011 ]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant numbers 52074147 ].","Statistical Review of World Energy, (2022); Lu, Xing, Recent progress and perspective on thermal-kinetic, heat and mass transportation of coal spontaneous combustion hazard, Fuel, 308, (2022); Zhang, Hemeng, Numerical simulations on the self-heating behaviours of coal piles considering aging effect, Combustion Theory and Modelling, 23, 6, pp. 1169-1190, (2019); Ren, Xiaofeng, Study of resource utilization and fire prevention characteristics of a novel gel formulated from coal mine sludge (MS), Fuel, 267, (2020); Melody, Shannon M., Coal mine fires and human health: What do we know?, International Journal of Coal Geology, 152, pp. 1-14, (2015); Song, Zeyang, Coal fires in China over the last decade: A comprehensive review, International Journal of Coal Geology, 133, pp. 72-99, (2014); van Dijk, Paul M., Assessment of the contribution of in-situ combustion of coal to greenhouse gas emission; based on a comparison of Chinese mining information to previous remote sensing estimates, International Journal of Coal Geology, 86, 1, pp. 108-119, (2011); Xi, Zhilin, Self-hardening thermoplastic foam for the inhibition of coal oxidation at low temperatures, Combustion Science and Technology, 191, 11, pp. 1942-1959, (2019); Wang, Yongjun, Effects of temperature gradient and particle size on self-ignition temperature of low-rank coal excavated from inner Mongolia, China, Royal Society Open Science, 6, 9, (2019); Dou, Guolan, Preparation and characterization of a lignin based hydrogel inhibitor on coal spontaneous combustion, Fuel, 308, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","2214157X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171561759"

Strawberries were coated with the edible coatings by dipping method and physicochemical properties (weight loss, moisture content, color change, firmness, pH and total soluble solids (TSS)) and internal structures were determined during storage at 2 °C for 24 days. Non-destructive X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used to visualize strawberry internal structure, with CT measured in terms of grayscale (GS) values. As expected, the CH + TSO film decreased water vapor permeability (WVP), with TSO conferring a reduction of 20.83 %. The CH + TSO film decreased moisture content (26.43 %) and water solubility (22.93 %). Incorporation of TSO in CH films significantly increased opacity by 204.76 %, greatly improving the ability to block light. Changes in the surface and structure of the films were obtained by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The properties of CH + TSO film were improved compared to pure CH film. Moreover, the results of storage for 24 days from the coating application to strawberries showed that CH and CH + TSO coatings effectively reduced fruit weight loss; retained firmness, color, moisture content by 86.69 % and 84.93 %, respectively, compared to the control (82.45 %), TSS by 10.22 % and 9.70 %, respectively, compared to the control (9.48 %); delayed pH changes by 3.49 % and 3.54 %, respectively, compared to the control (3.58 %) and ∆E by 8.06 % and 10.31 %, respectively, compared to the control (13.37 %).

In this context, inorganic-organic composites based on acid-base reactions emerge as essential candidates for medium-temperature PEMFC applications. This study aims to develop a proton-conductive salt by simultaneously coordinating multiple acid species with heterocyclic imidazole (Imi), which possesses basic sites capable of reacting with acids. The goal is to create a highly proton-conductive composite suitable for anhydrous conditions. The mechanochemical milling method was employed to incorporate SiO<inf>2</inf> as a second material into imidazole hydrochloride (ImiHCl). As a result, the addition of SiO<inf>2</inf> to ImiHCl led to an enhancement in proton conductivity compared with imidazole (Im), imidazole hydrochloride (ImiHCl), and imidazole-SiO<inf>2</inf> (Imi-SiO<inf>2</inf>). Furthermore, a method based on density functional theory (DFT) was proposed to predict the high/low proton conductivity, which exhibited good correlation with the experimentally obtained conductivity values. This DFT approach provided insights into the proton conduction mechanism. Through comprehensive physical characterizations (FT-IR, NMR, XRD, and TGA) and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the high proton conductivity observed in the corresponding xImiHCl-(100 - x)SiO<inf>2</inf> composites (composition ratio of ImiHCl: x = 40-100) can be attributed to an increased number of proton species, accelerated proton dissociation facilitated by SiO<inf>2</inf>, and promotion of proton diffusion. Particularly, the xImiHCl-(100 - x)SiO<inf>2</inf> (x = 60) electrolyte demonstrated the highest proton conductivity of 1.4 × 10-2 S cm-1. Subsequently, a PBI-based electrolyte membrane prepared using 60ImiHCl-40SiO<inf>2</inf> significantly enhanced the fuel cell performance to 521 mW cm-2 under anhydrous conditions at 150 °C. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chlorine Compounds; Density Functional Theory; Polyelectrolytes; Proton Conductivity; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (pemfc); Silicon; Solid Electrolytes; Acid-base Reactions; Anhydrous Conditions; Anhydrous Fuel Cells; Density-functional-theory; Fuel Cell Application; Heavy Duty; Imidazol; Inorganic/organic Composites; Medium Temperature; Proton Conductors; Silica","Chlorine compounds; Density functional theory; Polyelectrolytes; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Silicon; Solid electrolytes; Acid-base reactions; Anhydrous conditions; Anhydrous fuel cells; Density-functional-theory; Fuel cell application; Heavy duty; Imidazol; Inorganic/organic composites; Medium temperature; Proton conductors; Silica","","","K.M. took the lead in planning, material synthesis, analysis, fuel cell evaluation, and writing the manuscript on this work.

PAMs, when configured antagonistically, offer several advantages in creating human-like actuators. However, their inherent nonlinearity and uncertainty pose challenges for achieving precise control, especially in rehabilitation applications where control quality is crucial for safety and efficacy. To address these challenges, we propose an RBF-SMC approach that leverages the nonlinear elimination capability of SMC and the adaptive learning ability of RBFNN. The integration of these two techniques aims to develop a robust controller capable of effectively dealing with the inherent disadvantages of PAM systems under various operating conditions. The suggested RBF-SMC approach is theoretically verified using the Lyapunov stability theory, providing a solid foundation for its effectiveness. To validate its performance, extensive multi-scenario experiments were conducted, serving as a significant contribution of this research. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed controller compared to conventional controllers in terms of convergence time, robustness, and stability. This research offers a significant contribution to the field of PAM system control, particularly in the context of rehabilitation. The developed RBF-SMC approach provides an efficient and reliable solution to overcome the challenges posed by PAMs’ nonlinearity and uncertainty, enhancing control quality and ensuring the safety and efficacy of these systems in practical applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Control; Pneumatic Artificial Muscle; Radial Basis Function Neural Network; Sliding Mode Control; Adaptive Control Systems; Controllers; Muscle; Pneumatic Drives; Pneumatics; Quality Control; Radial Basis Function Networks; Adaptive Control; Control Approach; Control Quality; Muscle System; Performance; Pneumatic Artificial Muscle; Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (rbf); Radial Basis Neural Networks; Sliding-mode Control; Uncertainty; Sliding Mode Control","Adaptive control systems; Controllers; Muscle; Pneumatic drives; Pneumatics; Quality control; Radial basis function networks; Adaptive Control; Control approach; Control quality; Muscle system; Performance; Pneumatic artificial muscle; Radial basis function neural networks (RBF); Radial basis neural networks; Sliding-mode control; Uncertainty; Sliding mode control","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-002.","Sliding Modes in Control and Optimization, (1992); Afifa, Roohma, Adaptive Backstepping Integral Sliding Mode Control of a MIMO Separately Excited DC Motor, Robotics, 12, 4, (2023); Saleem, Omer, Fuzzy-Immune-Regulated Adaptive Degree-of-Stability LQR for a Self-Balancing Robotic Mechanism: Design and HIL Realization, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 8, 8, pp. 4577-4584, (2023); Ahmad, Sohail, Chattering Free Sliding Mode Control and State Dependent Kalman Filter Design for Underground Gasification Energy Conversion Process, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 4, (2023); Lilly, John H., A two-input sliding-mode controller for a planar arm actuated by four pneumatic muscle groups, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 12, 3, pp. 349-359, (2004); Vo, Cong Phat, A Novel Adaptive Gain Integral Terminal Sliding Mode Control Scheme of a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle System with Time-Delay Estimation, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 141133-141143, (2019); Chiang, Chiajui, Neural network fuzzy sliding mode control of pneumatic muscle actuators, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 65, pp. 68-86, (2017); Applied Nonlinear Control, (1991); Kachroo, Pushkin, Chattering reduction and error convergence in the sliding-mode control of a class of nonlinear systems, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 41, 7, pp. 1063-1068, (1996); Fridman, Leonid, An averaging approach to chattering, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 46, 8, pp. 1260-1265, (2001)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","25233971","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168650680"

The computational study is performed utilizing an effective compressible homogeneous liquid-vapor two-phase model incorporated with an algebraic-type thermodynamic phase-change model. The remarkable finding notices a great thermodynamic cavitation suppression on the vortex flow type at the temperature of the water around 323 K (50 °C), which is relatively low compared to that in shear-strain-dominated flow previously. The physics behind the suppression at high-temperature is considered by: a) the incorporation of the local saturated pressure drop with the earlier flow separation due to the deceleration of velocity in the boundary layer and the cavitating vortex being shed away from the cylinder that does not appear for the shear-strain cavitation flow type; b) the larger characteristic time scale ratio τ/τ<inf>tm</inf> compared to that at room temperature, so that, the thermodynamic effect can take place and has a significant impact on the phase-change. Furtherly, the suppression effect on the flow mechanism, the resulting load, and the vortex shedding frequency are analyzed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Homogeneous Model; Laminar Cylinder Flow; Shear-strain Flow; Thermodynamic Suppression; Time Scale Ratio; Vortex Cavitation; Boundary Layers; Cavitation; Circular Cylinders; Flow Separation; Flow Velocity; Shear Flow; Temperature; Cylinder Flows; Homogeneous Models; Laminar Cylinder Flow; Laminar Vortices; Scale Ratio; Shear-strain Flow; Thermodynamic Suppression; Time Scale Ratio; Time-scales; Vortex Cavitation; Vortex Flow","Boundary layers; Cavitation; Circular cylinders; Flow separation; Flow velocity; Shear flow; Temperature; Cylinder flows; Homogeneous models; Laminar cylinder flow; Laminar vortices; Scale ratio; Shear-strain flow; Thermodynamic suppression; Time scale ratio; Time-scales; Vortex cavitation; Vortex flow","","","","Hydrodynamics of Pumps, (1994); Design and Analysis of High Speed Pumps, (2006); Petkovšek, Martin, Observing the thermodynamic effects in cavitating flow by IR thermography, Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, 88, pp. 450-460, (2017); Sugaya, Koki, Experimental study on the boundary layer of the NACA16-012 hydrofoil during the cavitation disappearance phenomenon, Journal of Fluid Science and Technology, 17, 2, (2022); Iga, Yuka, Occurrence characteristics of gaseous cavitation in oil shear flow, Physics of Fluids, 34, 2, (2022); Kadivar, Ebrahim, An experimental investigation of transient cavitation control on a hydrofoil using hemispherical vortex generators, Journal of Hydrodynamics, 33, 6, pp. 1139-1147, (2021); Chebli, R., Influence of the turbulence modeling on the simulation of unsteady cavitating flows, Computers and Fluids, 221, (2021); Iga, Yuka, Numerical study of sheet cavitation breakoff phenomenon on a cascade hydrofoil, Journal of Fluids Engineering, 125, 4, pp. 643-651, (2003); Dinh Le, Anh, Modification of Energy Equation for Homogeneous Cavitation Simulation with Thermodynamic Effect, Journal of Fluids Engineering, 141, 8, (2019); Dinh Le, Anh, Assessment of a Homogeneous Model for Simulating a Cavitating Flow in Water Under a Wide Range of Temperatures, Journal of Fluids Engineering, 143, 10, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00179310","","IJHMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152935995"

In this phase the neutron source is a relatively simple, thick, low power (100 W) beryllium target located inside the conduit between the cyclotron hall and experimental hall of the SPES building []. The 3 m thick wall of the cyclotron cave provides shielding and the conduit acts as a collimator for the neutron beam directed to the neutron\u2019s experimental area. The expected neutron beam has a continuum spectrum with a different cut-off according to different proton energies. In this phase, a low proton current will be used ( 1 A) to reduce the radiation protection problems.

The system aims to enhance the surface quality of the rollers by detecting and classifying defects. A lighting system is installed to highlight surface defects. Two algorithms are proposed for defect detection: a traditional-based method and a deep learning-based method. The former is fast but limited to surface defect detection, while the latter is slower but capable of detecting and classifying defects. The accuracy of the algorithms is verified through experiments, with the traditional-based method achieving near-perfect accuracy of approximately 98% for defect detection, and the deep learning-based method achieving an accuracy of approximately 95.2% for defect detection and 96% for defect classification. The proposed machine vision system can significantly improve the surface inspection of black rubber rollers, thereby ensuring high-quality production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Deep Learning; Machine Vision; Rubber Roller; Surface Inspection","","","","This work was also supported by the Centennial Shibaura Institute of Technology Action to mark the 100th anniversary of Shibaura Institute of Technology and entry into the top ten Asian Institutes of Technology list and Support for Autonomous Higher Education Project (SAHEP) funded by World Bank for Hanoi University of Science and Technology.","Wang, Ren, Tire Defect Detection Using Fully Convolutional Network, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 43502-43510, (2019); Zheng, Zhouzhou, Tire defect classification using a deep convolutional sparse-coding network, Measurement Science and Technology, 32, 5, (2021); Yang, Shihao, Tire Speckle Interference Bubble Defect Detection Based on Improved Faster RCNN-FPN, Sensors, 22, 10, (2022); Lin, Shihlin, Research on tire crack detection using image deep learning method, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Zhu, Hongli, Research on defect detection in rubber rings, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 181 AISC, pp. 69-74, (2013); Shankar Bharathi, S.

However, their potential application in a variety of fields is limited by their time-consuming and costly complex fabrication process. In this study, electrospun 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-grafted polyimide (PI@APTES) nanofibers were used to construct nanofibrous aerogels (NFAs) via freeze-drying a dispersion of cross-linked-PI short fibers and a binder (PI@APTES), resulting in improved properties and functionalities. A highly siloxane cross-linked network structure was formed by hydrolysis and condensation reactions to generate stable nanofibrous aerogels. The obtained polyimide nanofibrous aerogels (PiNFAs) had a hierarchically three-dimensional (3D) microporous structure, high porosity (over 98%), tunable densities (10.6 ± 0.7-13.6 ± 0.2 mg cm-3), solvent resistance, superhydrophobicity (water contact angle over 163°), low thermal conductivity (as low as 33.2 mW m-1 K-1), and mechanical stability. These PiNFAs are promising candidates for potential applications in thermal insulation, lightweight construction, filtration, and sensors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrospinning; Hierarchical Structure; Nanofiber Aerogels; Polyimide; Thermal Insulation; Aerogels; Condensation Reactions; Contact Angle; Crosslinking; Mechanical Stability; Nanofibers; Polyimides; Porosity; Thermal Conductivity; Bulk Density; Cross-linked Polyimides; Electrospuns; Fabrication Process; Functional Performance; Hierarchical Cellular Structures; Hierarchical Structures; High Porosity; Nano-fibrous; Nanofiber Aerogel; Thermal Insulation","Aerogels; Condensation reactions; Contact angle; Crosslinking; Mechanical stability; Nanofibers; Polyimides; Porosity; Thermal conductivity; Bulk density; Cross-linked polyimides; Electrospuns; Fabrication process; Functional performance; Hierarchical cellular structures; Hierarchical structures; High porosity; Nano-fibrous; Nanofiber aerogel; Thermal insulation","","","The authors are grateful to Dr. Yukihiro Nishikawa at Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kyoto Institute of Technology for the X-ray CT measurements.

Greg.) is an herbaceous perennial plant which belongs to the Leguminosae family. This plant is well known for its use as a cover crop, but little information is available on the allelopathic potential of this legume. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the allelopathic effects of A. pintoi under various screening conditions and to analyze its potential allelochemicals using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In laboratory bioassays, aqueous extracts of A. pintoi powder exerted the average inhibition of the growth of Echinochloa crus-galli (55.1%), Oryza sativa (77.1%), and Vigna radiata (60.1%), respectively, of which the root lengths of the tested plants were the most suppressed. In greenhouse experiments, E. crus-galli was inhibited by 63.4% at 200 g/m2 of A. pintoi dried powder application. In field trials, A. pintoi also significantly reduced the growth of E. crus-galli and natural weeds. By incorporating a dose of 200 g/m2, the average inhibition of E. crus-galli was 43.9%, the dry weight of natural paddy weeds was 43.1%, and rice yield was simultaneously increased by 35%. The growth inhibitions of weeds and tested plants were proportional to the doses of A. pintoi applied and varied with the tested plant species. Among three different solvent extracts (methanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate), the hexane extract exerted the highest suppression against the growth of E. crus-galli and L. sativa by IC<inf>50</inf> against root and shoot growth = 4.08 and 8.4 mg/mL and 1.7 and 1.54 mg/mL, respectively, followed by ethyl acetate extract, while the least effective was methanol extract. From those extracts, a total of 35 substances were detected by GC-MS analyses, including 14 newly identified constituents, such as phenolic acids, stearic acid, palmitic acid, fatty acids, pyranones, and benzofurans, which may be responsible for the herbicidal effects of A. pintoi. This study suggests that A. pintoi may be used as a source of bioherbicide to minimize the dependency on harmful synthetic herbicides and enhance rice yield. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Allelochemical; Allelopathic Potential; Bioherbicide; Gc-ms Analysis; Paddy Weed; Rice Yield","","","","","Vyvyan, James R., Allelochemicals as leads for new herbicides and agrochemicals, Tetrahedron, 58, 9, pp. 1631-1646, (2002); Allelochemicals Biological Control of Plant Pathogens and Diseases, (2006); Singh, Harminder Pal, Phytotoxic Interference of Ageratum conyzoides with Wheat (Triticum aestivum), Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science, 189, 5, pp. 341-346, (2003); Herbicides Current Research and Case Studies in Use, (2013); Handbook of Natural Pesticides, (1985); Chauhan, Bhagirath Singh, Biology and Management of Problematic Crop Weed Species, 1st Edition, pp. 1-415, (2021); Khanh, Tran Dang, Weed suppression by Passiflora edulis and its potential allelochemicals, Weed Research, 46, 4, pp. 296-303, (2006); Some Issues on Plant Protection and Quarantine, (2013); Highly Hazardous Pesticides in Vietnam A Situational Analysis Report 1 38 an Giang University University of Economics Ho Chi Minh International Pollutants Elimination Network Ipeb for A Toxics Free Future 2020; Khanh, Tran Dang, The exploitation of crop allelopathy in sustainable agricultural production, Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science, 191, 3, pp. 172-184, (2005)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166512347"

Fly-ash additives are added to lubricating oils to improve oxidation resistance and prevent deposit formation, which may reduce viscosity loss at high temperatures. This study aimed to investigate the impact of fly-ash additives and temperature on the viscosity of oils B, C, and A. The experimental methodology involved comparing the viscosity of these oils with and without the addition of a 0.5% fly-ash additive. Viscosity measurements were taken at different temperatures. The results showed significant changes in viscosity after incorporating the fly-ash additive. At 25 °C, oils B, C, and A exhibited viscosity increases of 6.2%, 8.1%, and 13.8%, respectively, compared to the samples without the additive. Similarly, at 75 °C, the viscosity increments were 10.2%, 11.5%, and 22.8% for oils B, C, and A, respectively. At 85 °C, the corresponding increments were 11.1%, 16.6%, and 32.8%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of fly-ash additives in reducing the impact of temperature on oil viscosity, with oil A demonstrating the highest efficacy. By adjusting the viscosity of the oil at different temperatures, the fly-ash additives contribute to maintaining stable lubricating performance. Understanding the influence of fly-ash additives and temperature on oil viscosity is crucial for optimizing the performance of lubricants across various temperature conditions. Additionally, this knowledge assists in selecting the appropriate additive ratios for specific applications, thereby ensuring optimal lubricant performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fly-ash Additive; Shear Stress; Temperature; Viscosity","","","","Funding text 1: The School of Mechanical Engineering and Hanoi University of Science and Technology are gratefully acknowledged for providing support and conditions to carry out this research.

In the present research, a novel Electricity Generation System (EGS) driven by hybrid biomass fuel and geothermal source is developed and its performance is compared with Typical EGS (TEGS) driven by only the biomass fuel. The TEGS consists of a gas turbine cycle and a steam Rankine cycle equipped with an open-feed water heater (OFWH). In the proposed Hybrid Electricity Generation System (HEGS), the geothermal energy is deployed to heat the feedwater before entering the OFWH, as a result the bottoming Rankine cycle yields more electricity. However, a comprehensive investigation from technical and economic standpoints is required to compare its performance with the relevant TEGS. Therefore, through the application of thermodynamic, thermoeconomic, and environmental methodologies, the considered EGSs performance are modeled and comprehensively analyzed. Based on the modeling results, the maximum exergetic efficiency for the TEGS and HEGS is achieved, respectively as 40.8% and 43.05% under the gas turbine inlet temperature of 1550 K. Final optimal operating conditions are determined through a multi-criteria optimization respect to exergetic efficiency and cost criteria. Under these working conditions, the LCOE and exergetic efficiency for the TEGS are calculated to be respectively as 71.22 $/MWh and 43.22%. At this point, net electricity, total exergy destruction rate, and CO<inf>2</inf> emission rate are estimated to be as 7750 kW, 9446 kW, and 0.7401 kg/kWh, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comparative Study; Electricity Generation System; Environmental Effects; Hybrid Renewable Energy; Thermoeconomic; Biomass; Environmental Impact Assessments; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Fossil Fuels; Gas Turbines; Geothermal Energy; Multiobjective Optimization; Power Generation; Biomass Fuels; Comparatives Studies; Electricity-generation System; Exergetic Efficiency; Feed Water Heaters; Hybrid Renewable Energies; Performance; Performance Enhancements; Systems-driven; Thermoeconomic; Rankine Cycle","Biomass; Environmental impact assessments; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas turbines; Geothermal energy; Multiobjective optimization; Power generation; Biomass fuels; Comparatives studies; Electricity-generation system; Exergetic efficiency; Feed water heaters; Hybrid renewable energies; Performance; Performance enhancements; Systems-driven; Thermoeconomic; Rankine cycle","","","","Accurso, F., Installation of fuel cell-based cogeneration systems in the commercial and retail sector: Assessment in the framework of the COMSOS project, Energy Conversion and Management, 239, (2021); Azariyan, Hossein, Assessment of a high-performance geothermal-based multigeneration system for production of power, cooling, and hydrogen: Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic evaluation, Energy Conversion and Management, 236, (2021); Bai, Zhang, Thermodynamic evaluation of a novel solar-biomass hybrid power generation system, Energy Conversion and Management, 142, pp. 296-306, (2017); Bajpai, Prabodh, Hybrid renewable energy systems for power generation in stand-alone applications: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 16, 5, pp. 2926-2939, (2012); Calise, Francesco, Energy and economic analysis of a small hybrid solar-geothermal trigeneration system: A dynamic approach, Energy, 208, (2020); undefined, (2023); Cao, Yan, A novel hybrid biomass-solar driven triple combined power cycle integrated with hydrogen production: Multi-objective optimization based on power cost and CO2 emission, Energy Conversion and Management, 234, (2021); Cao, Yan, Proposal and thermo-economic optimization of using LNG cold exergy for compressor inlet cooling in an integrated biomass fueled triple combined power cycle, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 46, 29, pp. 15351-15366, (2021); Cao, Yan, Waste heat from a biomass fueled gas turbine for power generation via an ORC or compressor inlet cooling via an absorption refrigeration cycle: A thermoeconomic comparison, Applied Thermal Engineering, 182, (2021); Cao, Yan, Proposal and evaluation of two innovative combined gas turbine and ejector refrigeration cycles fueled by biogas: Thermodynamic and optimization analysis, Renewable Energy, 181, pp. 749-764, (2022)","","Institution of Chemical Engineers","","","","","","09575820; 17443598","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160076036"

The experiments were conducted at Reynolds number of 2.45 × 105 based on the model height. A global luminescent oil film skin-friction measurement technique was applied for the flow fields on the slant and base surfaces. The aerodynamic forces of the model were measured to understand the effect of the deflection angle on the aerodynamic characteristics. The pressure was measured and pressure drags acting on the slant and base surfaces were also calculated. The results showed that the drag and lift of the model suddenly dropped at the deflection angle above −5°. The pressure distribution on the slant and base surfaces became flat with a maximum drag reduction of 8% for the model with a deflection angle of 0°. The skin-friction measurement indicated that the drag reduction was connected to the breakdown of the separation bubble and longitudinal vortices on the slant. At the fully separated flow state, the skin-friction results illustrated two small vortices and a counter-clockwise vortex on the slant. Additionally, the wake vortices shifted from horizontal to vertical structures. The relation among the flow fields on the slant surface, flow on the symmetric plan, pressure distribution, and drag was illustrated for the model with different deflection angles. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahmed Body; Deflection Angle; Drag Reduction; Flow Topology; Skin Friction; Aerodynamic Drag; Aerodynamics; Deflection (structures); Flow Fields; Friction; Pressure Distribution; Reynolds Number; Skin Friction; Vortex Flow; Aerodynamic Characteristics; Ahmed Body; Ahmed Models; Base Surface; Deflection Angles; Flow Topology; Friction Measurements; Pressure Drag; Reynold Number; Surface Flow; Drag Reduction","Aerodynamic drag; Aerodynamics; Deflection (structures); Flow fields; Friction; Pressure distribution; Reynolds number; Skin friction; Vortex flow; Aerodynamic characteristics; Ahmed body; Ahmed models; Base surface; Deflection angles; Flow topology; Friction measurements; Pressure drag; Reynold number; Surface flow; Drag reduction","","","A part of this study was supported by the JSPS KAKEN Grant Number JP 21F21347 and the Collaborative Research Program of the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics, Kyushu University.","SAE Trans, (1984); Thacker, Adrien, Effects of suppressing the 3D separation on the rear slant on the flow structures around an Ahmed body, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 107-108, pp. 237-243, (2012); Mohammadikalakoo, B., Passive flow control on Ahmed body by rear linking tunnels, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 205, (2020); Choi, Haecheon, Aerodynamics of heavy vehicles, Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 46, pp. 441-468, (2014); Booysen, Adriaan, Large-scale 3D-PTV measurement of Ahmed-body wake in crossflow, Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, 132, (2022); Mariotti, Alessandro, Separation control and drag reduction for boat-tailed axisymmetric bodies through contoured transverse grooves, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 832, pp. 514-549, (2017); Thacker, Adrien, Experimental characterization of flow unsteadiness in the centerline plane of an Ahmed body rear slant, Experiments in Fluids, 54, 3, (2013); Wang, Hangfeng, Aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body based on deflectors, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 148, pp. 34-44, (2016); Rao, A., On the two flow states in the wake of a hatchback Ahmed body, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 173, pp. 262-278, (2018); Zhou, Yu, Recent Advances in Wake Dynamics and Active Drag Reduction of Simple Automotive Bodies, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 73, 6, (2021)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","08941777","","ETFSE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149857017"

To encourage the use of DMDA, this study offers a detailed description of the DMDA mix design, as well as a step-by-step standard operating procedure and an empirical example of the computation. Assessments of the long-term performance of green mixtures (self-consolidating concrete and high-performance concrete) and ordinary Portland cement concrete (designed using the conventional method of American Concrete Institute, ACI) were made. Performances of the ACI (O6000 mixture) and DMDA concretes (S6000 and H6000 mixtures) were then compared in terms of compressive strength, elastic modulus, shrinkage, and creep strain. As a result, all of the concrete samples attained the target strength of above 41 MPa (6000 psi) after only 28 days. Moreover, compressive strength, elastic modulus, shrinkage, and creep strain increased significantly in all of the concretes over curing time. Importantly, the experimental results confirmed that both types of DMDA concrete exhibited higher compressive strength and better long-term performance than the ACI concrete under elastic modulus, creep, and shrinkage aspects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autogenous Shrinkage; Compressive Strength; Creep Strain; Densified Mixture Design Algorithm; Drying Shrinkage; Elastic Modulus; Blast Furnaces; Concrete Mixtures; Creep; Curing; Elastic Moduli; Fly Ash; High Performance Concrete; Portland Cement; Product Design; Shrinkage; Slags; Autogenous Shrinkage; Creep Strain; Densified Mixture Design Algorithm; Drying Shrinkages; Green Concrete; Long Term Performance; Mix Designs; Mixture Design; Shrinkage And Creep; Shrinkage Strains; Compressive Strength","Blast furnaces; Concrete mixtures; Creep; Curing; Elastic moduli; Fly ash; High performance concrete; Portland cement; Product design; Shrinkage; Slags; Autogenous shrinkage; Creep strain; Densified mixture design algorithm; Drying shrinkages; Green concrete; Long term performance; Mix designs; Mixture design; Shrinkage and creep; Shrinkage strains; Compressive strength","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Novosibirsk State University [2021–2030].; Funding text 2: This research was financially supported by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Taiwan (grant #103-521).","Nordic Concrete Research, (2019); Structural Renovation in Concrete, (2014); undefined; Suhendro, Bambang, Toward green concrete for better sustainable environment, Procedia Engineering, 95, pp. 305-320, (2014); Synthesis Report Contribution of Working Groups I II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Geneva Switzerland Ipcc 2014; Dener, Murat, High temperature resistance of self compacting alkali activated slag/portland cement composite using lightweight aggregate, Construction and Building Materials, 290, (2021); Vishwakarma, Vinita, Green Concrete mix using solid waste and nanoparticles as alternatives – A review, Construction and Building Materials, 162, pp. 96-103, (2018); International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, (2011); Concrete International, (2002); Assessment, (2016)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","19447442; 19447450","","ENVPD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147508392"

The simulation was performed with contact angle condition to fit the Taylor cone shape by experiments. Experimental data are provided to verify and validate the numerical method, followed by additional analyses on the effects of electrical conductivity, surface tension, flow rate, and fluid viscosity on the electrospray characteristics, including spray current and jet diameter. Numerical results by simulations are in reasonable agreement with experiments and consistent with the literature. Analyses on different contact angles suggest potentially major impacts of this factor on the cone-jet mode in high voltage and low flow rate circumstances. Furthermore, the influence of corona discharge on electrospray is also investigated by both electrospray-corona simulation and experiment using a high-speed camera, yielding a significant improvement in the numerical prediction for Taylor cone formation. Numerical results indicate that liquid wetting on capillary nozzles would be a vital factor for the Taylor cone formation in numerical electrospray-corona discharge studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atomization; Contact Angle; Electric Corona; Electrohydrodynamics; High Speed Cameras; Numerical Methods; Condition; Cone Shape; Cone-jet Mode; Corona Discharges; Discharge Effects; Electrical Conductivity; Electrohydrodynamic Atomization; Electrosprays; Numerical Results; Taylor Cone; Wetting","Atomization; Contact angle; Electric corona; Electrohydrodynamics; High speed cameras; Numerical methods; Condition; Cone shape; Cone-jet mode; Corona discharges; Discharge effects; Electrical conductivity; Electrohydrodynamic atomization; Electrosprays; Numerical results; Taylor cone; Wetting","","","We acknowledge the support of time and facilities from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for this study.

The mechanism of modified sol–gel method is to utilise the esterification reaction between citric acid chelate and 2-propanol to spontaneously generate more homogeneous esterified-gel. This modified sol–gel method produced pure and highly crystalline ferrite-based oxides with more uniform morphology and effective carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) adsorption. It is a simpler and more efficient method than the traditional sol–gel method. XRD results proved the purity of the prepared ferrite-based oxides and exhibited smaller and comparable crystallite size when determined by the Debye–Scherrer equation. FTIR indicates the presence of metal–oxygen stretching bonds in the samples. Nitrogen sorption analysis confirmed the high surface area of ferrite-based oxides using this improvement method. EDX and XPS analyses verified the purity and chemical composition of the samples. The morphologies of the samples were investigated by SEM and HRTEM analysis.

Several factors related to the formation of zeolite, such as mixing ratios, aging time, and reaction time, were investigated. Furthermore, the potential phosphate adsorption of the optimal synthesized zeolite was evaluated. RESULTS: Under the optimal conditions (SiO<inf>2</inf>/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> molar ratio = 4.0, NaOH concentration = 1.5 M, aging time = 12 h, and reaction time = 8 h), the surface area and pore diameter of the zeolite NaP1 obtained were 50 m2 g−1 and 40.77 Å, respectively. By varying the aging and reaction times, zeolite NaP1 with different surface areas could be created. Specifically, reducing the aging time and reaction time result in zeolite NaP1 with a lower surface area. The adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity of the optimal synthesized zeolite NaP1 were 38.67% and 19.97 mg g−1, respectively, at pH 6.0, with an initial phosphate concentration of 100 mg L−1, an adsorbent dosage of 2 g L−1, and a contact time of 120 min. The data are well described under the Temkin and Redlich-Peterson models, with the correlation coefficients of 0.991 and 0.995, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of the Langmuir model reached 19.053 mg g−1. CONCLUSION: The main contribution of this work is the direct use of rice husk ash without pretreatment to generate high crystalline zeolite NaP1 in a shorter time. The phosphate ion removal efficiency by zeolite NaP1 may be further improved by functionalizing zeolite surfaces and expanding its other applications. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Phosphate; Rice Husk Ash; Short Aging Time; Zeolite Nap1; Phosphate; Silicon Dioxide; Chemical Industry; Efficiency; Molar Ratio; Silica; Sodium Hydroxide; Zeolites; Adsorption Capacities; Aging Reaction; Aging Time; Mixing Ratios; Rice-husk Ash; Short Aging Time; Surface Area; Synthesised; Synthesized Zeolite; Zeolite Nap1; Adsorption; Adsorbent; Aluminum Derivative; Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1; Phosphate; Silicon Dioxide; Zeolite; Adsorption; Aging; Article; Ash; Concentration (parameter); Contact Time; Controlled Study; Ph; Pore Size; Reaction Time; Rice Husk; Surface Area; Synthesis; Time; Waste Component Removal","Chemical industry; Efficiency; Molar ratio; Silica; Sodium hydroxide; Zeolites; Adsorption capacities; Aging reaction; Aging time; Mixing ratios; Rice-husk ash; Short aging time; Surface area; Synthesised; Synthesized zeolite; Zeolite nap1; Adsorption; adsorbent; aluminum derivative; nucleosome assembly protein 1; phosphate; silicon dioxide; zeolite; adsorption; aging; Article; ash; concentration (parameter); contact time; controlled study; pH; pore size; reaction time; rice husk; surface area; synthesis; time; waste component removal","","phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9","This research was funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant Number 103.02‐2020.64.","Goscianska, Joanna, Removal of phosphate from water by lanthanum-modified zeolites obtained from fly ash, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 513, pp. 72-81, (2018); Xu, Qianyu, Simultaneous removal of ammonia and phosphate using green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed onto zeolite, Science of the Total Environment, 703, (2020); Aljbour, Salah H., Phosphate removal from aqueous solutions by using natural Jordanian zeolitic tuff, Adsorption Science and Technology, 35, 3-4, pp. 284-299, (2017); Amiri, Mohammad Javad, Synthesis and optimization of spherical nZVI (20–60 nm) immobilized in bio-apatite-based material for efficient removal of phosphate: Box-Behnken design in a fixed-bed column, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 45, pp. 67751-67764, (2022); W Almanassra, Ismail W., A state of the art review on phosphate removal from water by biochars, Chemical Engineering Journal, 409, (2021); Wang, Junhong, Insight into the effect of structural characteristics of magnetic ZrO2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites on phosphate removal in water, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 249, (2020); Wei, Ting, Advanced phosphate removal by La–Zr–Zn ternary oxide: Performance and mechanism, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 817, (2020); Bessa, Raquel de Andrade, Kaolin-based magnetic zeolites A and P as water softeners, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 245, pp. 64-72, (2017); Yoldi, María, Zeolite synthesis from industrial wastes, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 287, pp. 183-191, (2019); Nakhli, Seyyed Ali Akbar, Application of Zeolites for Sustainable Agriculture: a Review on Water and Nutrient Retention, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 228, 12, (2017)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10974660; 02682575","","JCTBD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150910352"

In the pristine ZIF-204, the tetrahedral methane molecule anchors to an open monocopper site via the so-called η2 configuration with a physisorption energy of 0.24 eV. This weak binding arises from an electrostatic interaction between the negative charge of carbon in the methane molecule and the positive Cu2+ cation in the framework. In the modified ZIF-204, the doped oxo species is stabilized at the axial position of a CuN<inf>4</inf>-base square pyramid at a distance of 2.06 Å. The dative covalent bond between Cu and oxo is responsible for the formation energy of 1.06 eV. With the presence of the oxo group, the presenting of electrons in the O_p<inf>z</inf> orbital accounts for the adsorption of methane via hydrogen bonding with an adsorption energy of 0.30 eV. The methane oxidation can occur via either a concerted direct oxo insertion mechanism or a hydrogen-atom abstraction radical rebound mechanism. Calculations on transition-state barriers show that reactions via the concerted direct oxo insertion mechanism can happen without energy barriers. Concerning the hydrogen-atom abstraction radical rebound mechanism, the C-H bond dissociation of the CH<inf>4</inf> molecule is barrierless, but the C-O bond recombination to form the CH<inf>3</inf>OH molecule occurs through a low barrier of 0.16 eV. These predictions suggest the modified ZIF-204 is a promising catalyst for methane oxidization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abstracting; Atoms; Density Functional Theory; Hydrogen Bonds; Molecules; Organometallics; Bio-mimetics; Conversion Of Methanes; Dft-based; Direct Conversion; Direct Oxidation; Hydrogen Atom Abstraction; Insertion Mechanism; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Methane Molecules; Oxidation Of Methane; Methane","Abstracting; Atoms; Density functional theory; Hydrogen bonds; Molecules; Organometallics; Bio-mimetics; Conversion of methanes; DFT-based; Direct conversion; Direct oxidation; Hydrogen atom abstraction; Insertion mechanism; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Methane molecules; Oxidation of methane; Methane","","","This research was funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2022-50-03.

In recent decades, many techniques have been developed to enhance the performance of this algorithm, such as the Improve Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (ISADE) algorithm. Based on the analysis of the aspects that may improve the performance of ISADE, we proposed a modified ISADE version with applying the Gauss distribution for mutation procedure. In ISADE, to determine the scaling factor (F), the population is ranked, then, based on the rank number, population size, and current generation, the formula of the Sigmoid function is used. In the proposed algorithm, F is amplified by a factor which is generated based on Gaussian distribution. It has the potential to enhance the variety of population. In comparison with several reference algorithms regarding converging speed and the consistency of optimal solutions, the simulation results reveal the performance of the suggested algorithm is exceptional. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Differential Evolution; Gauss Distribution; Mutation Procedure; Optimization Algorithm","","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-036.; Funding text 2: This work was also supported by the Centennial SIT Action for the 100th anniversary of Shibaura Institute of Technology to enter the top ten Asian Institute of Technology.","Storn, Rainer, Differential Evolution - A Simple and Efficient Heuristic for Global Optimization over Continuous Spaces, Journal of Global Optimization, 11, 4, pp. 341-359, (1997); Doc Math Extra, (2012); A Treatise of Algebra both Historical and Practical, (1685); Qin, A.

However, cell compatibility on different Ca-P layers coated on ZK60 alloy has seldom been investigated. In this study, the effects of type, morphology and corrosion protection of several Ca-P coatings formed at pH 6.5, 7.8 and 10.2 on cell behavior were examined by using an osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. Furthermore, in vivo behavior in rabbits of the alloy coated with the optimum Ca-P layer was also studied. It was found that the surface factors governed the cell morphology and density. The coating morphology plays a dominant role in these surface factors. The sample coated at pH 7.8 showed the best cellular biocompatibility, suggesting that the hydroxyapatite (HAp) layer formed at pH 7.8 was the optimum coating. In rabbits, this optimum coating enhanced remarkably the corrosion resistance of the alloy. During implantation, the outermost crystals of the HAp coating were shortened and thinned due to the dissolution of HAp caused by the body fluid of the rabbits. It is indicated that ZK60 alloy coated at pH 7.8 can be applied as a biodegradable implant. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradation; Calcium Phosphate Coating; Cellular Biocompatibility; Implantation; Zk60; Calcium Phosphate; Hydroxyapatite; Magnesium; Propofol; Alloys; Calcium Phosphate; Calcium Phosphates; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Durapatite; Zk60 Magnesium Alloy; Biocompatibility; Biodegradation; Body Fluids; Cell Culture; Cells; Corrosion Resistance; Corrosion Resistant Alloys; Corrosion Resistant Coatings; Hydroxyapatite; Magnesium Alloys; Morphology; Phosphate Coatings; Calcium-phosphate Coatings; Cellular Biocompatibility; Cellulars; Implantation; In-vitro; In-vivo; Vivo Degradation; Zk60; Zk60 Alloy; Zk60 Magnesium Alloy; Calcium Phosphate; Alloy; Calcium Phosphate; Hydroxyapatite; Magnesium; Propofol; Biocompatible Coated Material; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Article; Biocompatibility; Biodegradation; Body Fluid; Cell Adhesion; Cell Culture; Cell Density; Cell Viability; Coating (procedure); Controlled Study; Corrosion; Crystal; Degradation; Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy; Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy; In Vitro Study; In Vivo Study; Leporidae; Macrophage; Mc3t3-e1 Cell Line; Nonhuman; Ph; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Surface Property; X Ray Diffraction; Animal; Chemistry; Materials Testing; Alloys; Animals; Calcium Phosphates; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Corrosion; Durapatite; Materials Testing; Rabbits","Biocompatibility; Biodegradation; Body fluids; Cell culture; Cells; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosion resistant coatings; Hydroxyapatite; Magnesium alloys; Morphology; Phosphate coatings; Calcium-phosphate coatings; Cellular biocompatibility; Cellulars; Implantation; In-vitro; In-vivo; Vivo degradation; Zk60; ZK60 alloy; ZK60 magnesium alloy; Calcium phosphate; alloy; calcium phosphate; hydroxyapatite; magnesium; propofol; biocompatible coated material; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; biocompatibility; biodegradation; body fluid; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell density; cell viability; coating (procedure); controlled study; corrosion; crystal; degradation; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; field emission scanning electron microscopy; in vitro study; in vivo study; Leporidae; macrophage; MC3T3-E1 cell line; nonhuman; pH; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; X ray diffraction; animal; chemistry; materials testing; Alloys; Animals; Calcium Phosphates; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Corrosion; Durapatite; Materials Testing; Rabbits","","calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; magnesium, 7439-95-4; propofol, 2078-54-8; Alloys; calcium phosphate; Calcium Phosphates; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Durapatite; ZK60 magnesium alloy","","Niinomi, Mitsuo, Development of new metallic alloys for biomedical applications, Acta Biomaterialia, 8, 11, pp. 3888-3903, (2012); Kamrani, Sepideh, Biodegradable magnesium alloys as temporary orthopaedic implants: a review, BioMetals, 32, 2, pp. 185-193, (2019); Gu, Xuenan, In vitro degradation performance and biological response of a Mg-Zn-Zr alloy, Materials Science and Engineering: B, 176, 20, pp. 1778-1784, (2011); Huan, Zhiguang, In vitro degradation behavior and cytocompatibility of Mg-Zn-Zr alloys, Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine, 21, 9, pp. 2623-2635, (2010); Chen, Junxiu, Effect of heat treatment on mechanical and biodegradable properties of an extruded ZK60 alloy, Bioactive Materials, 2, 1, pp. 19-26, (2017); Mani, Gopinath, Coronary stents: A materials perspective, Biomaterials, 28, 9, pp. 1689-1710, (2007); Song, Guangling, Control of biodegradation of biocompatable magnesium alloys, Corrosion Science, 49, 4, pp. 1696-1701, (2007); Zhao, Deiwei, Current status on clinical applications of magnesium-based orthopaedic implants: A review from clinical translational perspective, Biomaterials, 112, pp. 287-302, (2017); Radha, R., Insight of magnesium alloys and composites for orthopedic implant applications – a review, Journal of Magnesium and Alloys, 5, 3, pp. 286-312, (2017); Zhou, Huan, Monetite, an important calcium phosphate compound–Its synthesis, properties and applications in orthopedics, Acta Biomaterialia, 127, pp. 41-55, (2021)","","Institute of Physics","","","","","","1748605X; 17486041","9780387848716","","36827743","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150225701"

Using this approach, we produced unique structures of graphene nanosheet-engulfed ultrathin WSe<inf>2</inf> nanosheets (WSe<inf>2</inf>@GN), stabilized through van der Waals and π–π interactions between the WSe<inf>2</inf> and GNs, possessing various morphologies and featuring large edge and defect densities on the basal plane of the GNs—potential active sites for HER catalysis. This synthesis of WSe<inf>2</inf>@GN structures not only increased the number of active sites in the semiconducting WSe<inf>2</inf> nanosheets but also enhanced their conductivity. Our dual-cathode plasma produced WSe<inf>2</inf>@GN nanosheet composites exhibited high HER performance, characterized by a low overpotential of 106 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2, a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec–1, and long-term stability in 0.5 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> (80% activity retention after >48 h); these performance metrics were much better than those of the corresponding WSe<inf>2</inf>/GN composite, prepared through two sequential single-cathode electrochemical plasma exfoliation and mixed together (233 mV, 111 mV dec–1), and are among the best ever reported for a composite involving WSe<inf>2</inf> and GNs, prepared through simultaneous exfoliation at a low temperature and over a short period of time, for the HER. This in situ dual-plasma-exfoliation synthetic approach allows the effective production of homogeneous 2D/2D heterostructures with great potential for various energy-related applications, while being an effective and simple strategy for tuning the morphologies of composites of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide materials for a broad range of energy applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d/2d; Dual Cathode-induced Surface Plasma Exfoliation; Electrocatalyst; Hydrogen Evolution Reaction; Wse2/gn Composites; Cathodes; Exfoliation (materials Science); Graphene; Hydrogen; Nanosheets; Plasma Stability; Selenium Compounds; Slope Stability; Temperature; Transition Metals; Tungsten Compounds; Van Der Waals Forces; 2d/2d; Cathode Plasmas; Dual Cathode-induced Surface Plasma Exfoliation; Dual Cathodes; Graphene Nanosheets; Hydrogen Evolution Reactions; Performance; Plasma-induced; Surface Plasma; Wse2/gn Composite; Electrocatalysts","Cathodes; Exfoliation (materials science); Graphene; Hydrogen; Nanosheets; Plasma stability; Selenium compounds; Slope stability; Temperature; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Van der Waals forces; 2d/2d; Cathode plasmas; Dual cathode-induced surface plasma exfoliation; Dual cathodes; Graphene nanosheets; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Performance; Plasma-induced; Surface plasma; WSe2/GN composite; Electrocatalysts","","","This study was performed under the auspices of the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (grant nos.: MOST 109-2221-E-009 -064 -MY3 , MOST 110-2221-E-A49 -046 -MY3 , MOST 111-2623-E-A49-005 , MOST 111-2634-F-A49-007 , NSTC 111-2623-E-A49-006 ) and the Center for Emergent Functional Matter Science of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan .","Zhao, Guoqiang, Heterostructures for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: A Review, Advanced Functional Materials, 28, 43, (2018); Yadav, Vamakshi, Modulating the Structure and Hydrogen Evolution Reactivity of Metal Chalcogenide Complexes through Ligand Exchange onto Colloidal Au Nanoparticles, ACS Catalysis, 10, 22, pp. 13305-13313, (2020); Hughes, Jack P., Enhancing the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction utilising Fe3P bulk modified screen-printed electrodesviathe application of a magnetic field, RSC Advances, 11, 14, pp. 8073-8079, (2021); Mohl, Melinda, 2D Tungsten Chalcogenides: Synthesis, Properties and Applications, Advanced Materials Interfaces, 7, 13, (2020); Dang, Van Dien, S-scheme N-doped carbon dots anchored g-C3N4/Fe2O3 shell/core composite for photoelectrocatalytic trimethoprim degradation and water splitting, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 320, (2023); Wu, Jun, Rational Construction of a WS2/CoS2 Heterostructure Electrocatalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution at All pH Values, ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, 8, 11, pp. 4474-4480, (2020); Wu, Jun, Single-Atom Tungsten-Doped CoP Nanoarrays as a High-Efficiency pH-Universal Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, 8, 39, pp. 14825-14832, (2020); Hinnemann, Berit, Biomimetic hydrogen evolution: MoS2 nanoparticles as catalyst for hydrogen evolution, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 127, 15, pp. 5308-5309, (2005); Tang, Libin, Bottom-up synthesis of large-scale graphene oxide nanosheets, Journal of Materials Chemistry, 22, 12, pp. 5676-5683, (2012); Alkhouzaam, Abedalkader I., Synthesis of graphene oxides particle of high oxidation degree using a modified Hummers method, Ceramics International, 46, 15, pp. 23997-24007, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00134686","","ELCAA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149838257"

The total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) were determined using Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl<inf>3</inf> colorimetric assays. The antioxidant capacity was examined by reducing power (RP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), ABTS⋅+, and DPPH⋅+ radical cation assays. All extracts potentially exhibited antioxidant activity with IC<inf>50</inf> values ranging from 2.93 to 5.73 μg/mL for ABTS⋅+ and from 5.69 to 7.65 μg/mL for DPPH⋅+ except the n-hex extract. The BuOH, MeOH, and aqueous extract possess promising anti-skin-aging activities, as observed by an attenuation of UV-A toxicity on human keratinocytes. We proposed that these anti-skin-aging properties are possibly due to direct scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species and upregulate cellular antioxidant machinery. Moreover, we found that the antioxidant capacity was well correlated with anti-inflammatory capacity against nitric oxide (NO) production in terms of the n-hex, AcOEt, and BuOH extracts with IC<inf>50</inf> values from 23.21 to 47.1 μg/mL. In contrast, these activities were found to be poorly correlated with AchE activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the antioxidant, anti-skin-aging, anti-inflammatory, and anti-acetylcholinesterase activities of the extracts of R. oligophlebia roots. These findings indicated that this species could be a potential source of natural antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-inflammatory agents. Consequently, it may be suggested as a medicinal plant that prevents diseases related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-acetylcholinesterase; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-skin-aging; Antioxidant; R.

A non-noble metal catalyst and mild reaction conditions are highlighted in this work. Co-Cu nanoparticles supported on activated carbon (Co-Cu/AC) were introduced in the liquid-phase oxidation of HMF. The catalysts were prepared via a co-impregnation method, followed by reduction with hydrazine. The presence of the Cu promoter resulted in dispersion of the metal particles. The good distribution and small crystal size of Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> significantly increased the active surface area and enhanced the catalytic activity. In addition, the presence of CuO synergized with the oxidation ability of the Co catalyst to increase the FDCA yield. The catalytic activity at different reaction temperatures, reaction times, catalyst loadings, and Co:Cu ratios revealed that the highest selectivity for FDCA (92%) was achieved using the 4Co-Cu/AC catalyst. According to the proposed reaction mechanism, the redox reaction between Cu2+/Cu+ and Co3+/Co4+, together with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> as the oxidant, promotes the complete oxidation of HMF to FDCA. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2,5-furandicarboxylic Acid; 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; Biopolymer; Co-cu Catalyst; Selective Oxidation; Activated Carbon; Binary Alloys; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Catalyst Selectivity; Copper Oxides; Nitrogen Compounds; Oxidation; Precious Metals; Redox Reactions; 2,5-furandicarboxylic Acid; 5 Hydroxymethyl Furfurals; Activated Carbon Catalysts; Co-cu Catalysts; Key Reactions; Liquid-phase Oxidation; Non-noble Metal Catalysts; Selective Oxidation; [co/cu]; Catalyst Activity","Activated carbon; Binary alloys; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Catalyst selectivity; Copper oxides; Nitrogen compounds; Oxidation; Precious metals; Redox reactions; 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Activated carbon catalysts; Co-cu catalysts; Key reactions; Liquid-phase oxidation; Non-noble metal catalysts; Selective oxidation; [Co/Cu]; Catalyst activity","","","This study was financially supported by the National Research Council of Thailand [Contract No. NA41A640093 ] and the Thammasat University Research Unit in Bioenergy and Catalysis.

Here, for the first time, we propose a monolayer Janus structure with the Mexican-hat band, γ-GeSSe, by replacing the S atoms on one side of the synthesized γ-GeS with Se atoms. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), we show that γ-GeSSe is mechanically, dynamically, and thermally stable. The mechanical, electronic, optical, and transport properties of monolayer Janus γ-GeSSe are also investigated in the DFT calculations. We find that the ideal strengths of the Janus γ-GeSSe are 6.08, 8.6, and 10.08 GPa for the armchair, zigzag, and biaxial directions, respectively. The Janus γ-GeSSe is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.131 eV. Our results show the Janus γ-GeSSe as a photocatalysis material for water splitting with a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 28.78%. This is because the combination of features includes an intrinsic electric field, high optical absorption coefficient, and carrier mobility. In addition, with the γ-structure, the Janus γ-GeSSe shows an intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity of 3.33 W/mK at room temperature, which will contribute to obtaining high TE efficiency. By using the Boltzmann transport theory, we find that the maximum TE power factor and figure of merit of the Janus γ-GeSSe reach 55-85 mW/mK2 and 0.7-0.9 in the temperature range from 300 to 900 K, respectively. Thus, our findings not only contribute to proposing a Janus material but also suggest that it can be used as an energy material with high-performance photocatalysis and TE. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Density Functional Theory; Ideal Strength; Janus Monolayer; Photocatalysis; Thermoelectricity; Density Functional Theory; Electric Fields; Energy Gap; Hydrogen; Light Absorption; Photocatalysis; Solar Power Generation; Statistical Mechanics; Thermal Conductivity; Thermoelectric Equipment; Thermoelectricity; Density-functional-theory; Energy Applications; First Principle Calculations; High Performance Material; Ideal Strength; Janus Monolayer; Mechanically Stable; Synthesised; Thermally Stable; Two-dimensional; Monolayers","Density functional theory; Electric fields; Energy gap; Hydrogen; Light absorption; Photocatalysis; Solar power generation; Statistical mechanics; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Density-functional-theory; Energy applications; First principle calculations; High performance material; Ideal strength; Janus monolayer; Mechanically stable; Synthesised; Thermally stable; Two-dimensional; Monolayers","","","N.T.H. acknowledges JSPS KAKENHI (No. JP20K15178), FRIS Creative Interdisciplinary Collaboration Program in Tohoku University, and financial support from the Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences in Tohoku University.","Fujishima, Akira, Electrochemical photolysis of water at a semiconductor electrode, Nature, 238, 5358, pp. 37-38, (1972); Wang, Zheng, Recent developments in heterogeneous photocatalysts for solar-driven overall water splitting, Chemical Society Reviews, 48, 7, pp. 2109-2125, (2019); Zhuang, Houlong, Computational search for single-layer transition-metal dichalcogenide photocatalysts, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 117, 40, pp. 20440-20445, (2013); Huang, Caijin, Carbon-doped BN nanosheets for metal-free photoredox catalysis, Nature Communications, 6, (2015); Hu, Wei, Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting over Edge-Modified Phosphorene Nanoribbons, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 139, 43, pp. 15429-15436, (2017); Guan, Shan, Tunable ferroelectricity and anisotropic electric transport in monolayer β -GeSe, Physical Review B, 97, 14, (2018); Hicks, L.

Ions with 2 MeV incident energy were irradiated onto MgB<inf>2</inf> thin films at room temperature and various dose levels from 2 × 1012 to 7 × 1013 atoms/cm2. X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure results confirmed extended average bond lengths and increased mean-square relative displacement that correlated with crystalline disorder serving as artificial pinning centers induced by ion irradiation. While the superconducting transition temperature (T<inf>c</inf>) exhibited a decreasing trend, the magnetization J<inf>c</inf> (H) of the irradiated films measured at both 5 K and 20 K were remarkably enhanced compared to that of pristine films at high applied magnetic fields. The decreases in exponent β from 1.1 and 1.13 to 0.69 and 0.62 after irradiation at 5 K and 20 K, respectively, as the dose increased to 5 × 1013 atoms/cm2 indicates a shift in the pinning mechanism from weak collective pinning to strong plastic pinning according to collective pinning theory. In addition, the scaling behavior of the flux pinning force density (F<inf>p</inf>) in the irradiated MgB<inf>2</inf> films showed a crossover from surface pinning to normal point pinning.

Herein, a new type of biodegradable disulfide-based PMO was synthesized by incorporating disulfide linkers into the silica framework of nanoparticles (NPs). The homogeneous spherical morphology with an average size of 50 nm is observed by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the physicochemical characterizations were also performed by using Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of disulfide in the structure of NPs. It is notable that the disulfide moieties incorporated into the structure of NPs lead to fast degradation, within 5 days to complete degradation. Paclitaxel (PTX), a hydrophobic anticancer drug, was loaded into the porous particles with a high loading capacity up to 602 mg.g−1. A large amount of PTX was released at the early stage of the release process in the phosphate buffer saline solution containing reduced glutathione and then released slowly at a steady rate. The effective cellular uptake of NPs into malignant cells and normal cells also demonstrated. PTX-loaded NPs exhibited higher anticancer activity against cancer cells as compared to free PTX, indicating the potential nanocarrier for cancer therapy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradable Particle; Cancer Therapy; Disulfide Linkers; Drug Delivery System; Paclitaxel; Disulfide; Glutathione; Paclitaxel; Sodium Chloride; Cancer Cells; Controlled Drug Delivery; Diseases; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Mesoporous Materials; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Silica Nanoparticles; Sulfur Compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Targeted Drug Delivery; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Anticancer Drug; Biodegradable Particle; Cancer Therapy; Disulphide Linker; Drug-delivery Systems; Functionalized; Mesoporous; Nanocarriers; Paclitaxel; Periodic Mesoporous Organosilicas (pmos); Degradation; Buffer; Disulfide; Glutathione; Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle; Nanocarrier; Paclitaxel; Sodium Chloride; Antineoplastic Activity; Article; Cancer Cell; Cancer Staging; Cancer Therapy; Cell Membrane; Chemical Composition; Confocal Microscopy; Controlled Study; Cytotoxicity; Degradation; Drug Delivery System; Fourier Transform; Hydrophobicity; Infrared Radiation; Morphology; Structure Analysis; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy; Zeta Potential","Cancer cells; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Mesoporous materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica nanoparticles; Sulfur compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Targeted drug delivery; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Anticancer drug; Biodegradable particle; Cancer therapy; Disulphide linker; Drug-delivery systems; Functionalized; Mesoporous; Nanocarriers; Paclitaxel; Periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs); Degradation; buffer; disulfide; glutathione; mesoporous silica nanoparticle; nanocarrier; paclitaxel; sodium chloride; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer cell; cancer staging; cancer therapy; cell membrane; chemical composition; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; degradation; drug delivery system; Fourier transform; hydrophobicity; infrared radiation; morphology; structure analysis; transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; zeta potential","","disulfide, 16734-12-6; glutathione, 70-18-8; paclitaxel, 33069-62-4; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1","This study was supported by the Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City under grant number VNU-B 562-2021-50-01 .","Fu, Qiang, Improving paclitaxel pharmacokinetics by using tumor-specific mesoporous silica nanoparticles with intraperitoneal delivery, Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine, 12, 7, pp. 1951-1959, (2016); undefined, (2019); Li, Rui, Nanodrug delivery systems for targeting the endogenous tumor microenvironment and simultaneously overcoming multidrug resistance properties, Journal of Controlled Release, 251, pp. 49-67, (2017); Guo, Xiaoshuang, Advances in redox-responsive drug delivery systems of tumor microenvironment, Journal of Nanobiotechnology, 16, 1, (2018); Mai, Ngoc Xuan Dat, Biodegradable Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica (BPMO) Loaded with Daunorubicin: A Promising Nanoparticle-Based Anticancer Drug, ChemMedChem, 15, 7, pp. 593-599, (2020); Croissant, Jonas G., Biodegradable ethylene-bis(propyl)disulfide-based periodic mesoporous organosilica nanorods and nanospheres for efficient in-vitro drug delivery, Advanced Materials, 26, 35, pp. 6174-6180, (2014); Maggini, Laura, Breakable mesoporous silica nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery, Nanoscale, 8, 13, pp. 7240-7247, (2016); Croissant, Jonas G., Biodegradable Oxamide-Phenylene-Based Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles with Unprecedented Drug Payloads for Delivery in Cells, Chemistry - A European Journal, 22, 42, pp. 14806-14811, (2016); Dat Mai, Ngoc Xuan, Facile synthesis of biodegradable mesoporous functionalized-organosilica nanoparticles for enhancing the anti-cancer efficiency of cordycepin, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 315, (2021); Mai, Ngoc Xuan Dat, Reducing particle size of biodegradable nanomaterial for efficient curcumin loading, Journal of Materials Science, 56, 5, pp. 3713-3722, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18734359; 09277757","","CPEAE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140431024"

Aerobic composting is one of the most effective methods for reducing this waste as well as decarbonization, but with poor management, it is the greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resource, there are 37 composting facilities in Vietnam, treating 16 % of the total municipal solid waste. However, the number of well-maintained facilities is decreasing over time, due to difficulties and challenges in operating and maintaining highly efficient composting. This study aimed at evaluating the current situation of composting facilities in Vietnam, evaluating the efficiency and problems in the composting facility in Hoi An City (HAC). Social and technical surveys were conducted to identify the social consensus on waste separation and to measure the performance of the Cam Ha composting facility. The results indicated that 91.95 % of HAC’s households were aware of the separation of waste since the waste segregation policy was implemented in 2012. In the composting facilities, raw materials for composting contained 40.44 % inorganic matter, showing the low efficiency in waste separation at source. 1.27 % glass and plastic debris in the composting product lowering the compost quality, raising the concern on human health and safety.

Sampling survey and social survey were conducted to collect data. Material flow analysis was utilised to analyse the flow of the BSW. Results denoted that the generated BSW flowed in five directions namely home husbandry, home composting, formal collecting without separation, segregated collection by informal sectors and leakage to the environment. Proportions of such waste streams are not the same across city types, waste management systems, and consumer markets. The daily biodegradable waste generation amounts were estimated at 612.12 tons in Danang city (DNC), 318.65 tons in Hue city (HUC), and 65.28 tons in Hoi An city (HAC). Most of biodegradable waste was managed by the formal waste collection system with 89 %, 73 %, and 88 % for DNC, HUC, and HAC. Interestingly, HAC was the only area operating composting facility with 49 % of biodegradable waste being recycled. The study also revealed an unsung informal sector of the BSW, operating in an unforeseen routine compared with itinerant recyclable-waste buyers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors are thankful to University of Technology and Education — The University of Danang, Hue University, People’s Committee of Danang city, People’s Committee of Hue city, People’s Committee of Hoi An city, Danang Urban Environment Company, Hue Urban Environment And Public Works Joint Stock Company, Hang Trung Limited Company, and Hoi An Public Work Company for supporting the survey.

Improving the efficiency of rice farming and expanding production towards sustainability has become one of the national economic development goals. This study aimed to empirically evaluate technical efficiency of rice farms based on their farming practices using observational data from face-to-face interviews with 152 rice farm households in Long An Province in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The data envelopment analysis model was applied to evaluate the technical and scale efficiencies. Results show that except for farmers applying one practice, the average technical efficiency exceeded 81 %. Farmers who adopted more sustainable practices obtained higher technical efficiency and scale efficiency with scores of 90 % and 91 % respectively. Many farmers with different combinations of farming practices operated under increasing returns to scale. The Tobit model was also applied to estimate the determinant factors of technical efficiency. The results of the Tobit model revealed that the farmer’s education level and farming experience had a significant impact on rice farming efficiency. The study also found an inverted U-shaped relationship between education level and efficiency, which indicates that if farmers had higher education levels beyond the threshold point, their farming efficiency will decrease. The significance of adopting sustainable agriculture practices in rice-producing households was emphasized by the positive correlation observed between the number of sustainable agriculture practices applied and efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","An Introduction to Efficiency and Productivity Analysis, (1998); Crowder, David William, Financial competitiveness of organic agriculture on a global scale, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 24, pp. 7611-7616, (2015); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, (1957); Dimensions of Need an Atlas of Food and Agriculture, (1995); Statistical Analysis and Forecasting Report 2019, (2020); Ritsumeikan Economic Review, (2019); Huang, Jikun, Long-term reduction of nitrogen fertilizer use through knowledge training in rice production in China, Agricultural Systems, 135, pp. 105-111, (2015); Asian Journal of Agriculture and Development, (2009); Journal of Issaas, (2011); Khanal, Uttam, Do climate change adaptation practices improve technical efficiency of smallholder farmers?

The mixing of domestic waste in collection and treatment has brought significant environmental consequences. The waste separation policy towards strategic goals in waste management has posed many challenges for the locality in implementation. This study aims to develop a pilot of the thermal composting system to optimize the household organic waste composting process. The pilot has a volume of 12 L, a bottom heating system, and a temperature measurement and monitoring system. The system operates on a batch mechanism; the first batch is started with the addition of sawdust substrate at a rate of 1/3 of the volume of food waste. From the 2nd batch onwards, 1/3 of the compost product is kept in the system to mix with the raw materials. The heating system only provides a temperature of 40 °C during the first 2 d of the treatment. The results show that the thermal-composting system is activated quickly in the first 2 d, and the treatment process is highly effective in the next 3 d with temperatures ranging from 60 to 70 °C. The pile volume decreased rapidly by 50 % within 5 d of treatment and stabilized gradually in the last 2 d. After 7 d of treatment, the compost has a temperature of about 40 °C with a moisture content of 31.3 %. Compost products have high organic content (57.8 %), low nutrient content, and heavy metal content below the allowable threshold in microbial organic fertilizers standards (TCVN 7185:2002). Efficiency in home composting with a shortened retention time of 7 d, simple operation, and friendly compost quality are the outstanding results of this applied research. This study provides a practical product for implementing new waste management regulations in Vietnam. It also awakens the potential to promote the municipal organic solid waste recycling system, contributing to reducing the waste to landfills and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions towards a waste circular economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank the GSGES Seeds Funding Programme 2022 of the Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, and The University of Danang for financial assistance and collaboration in this study.","Ahn, Hee Kwon, Mass and thermal balance during composting of a poultry manure-Wood shavings mixture at different aeration rates, Process Biochemistry, 42, 2, pp. 215-223, (2007); Atieno, Mary, Assessment of biofertilizer use for sustainable agriculture in the Great Mekong Region, Journal of Environmental Management, 275, (2020); Cui, Peng, Hyperthermophilic composting reduces nitrogen loss via inhibiting ammonifiers and enhancing nitrogenous humic substance formation, Science of the Total Environment, 692, pp. 98-106, (2019); Elango, D., Thermophilic composting of municipal solid waste, Applied Energy, 86, 5, pp. 663-668, (2009); Kalemelawa, Frank, An evaluation of aerobic and anaerobic composting of banana peels treated with different inoculums for soil nutrient replenishment, Bioresource Technology, 126, pp. 375-382, (2012); Liu, Chen, Food waste in Japan: Trends, current practices and key challenges, Journal of Cleaner Production, 133, pp. 557-564, (2016); National Environmental Status Report Topic Municipal Solid Waste Management, (2020); Pham Phu, Song Toan, ORIENTED-PLANNING SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN VIETNAM TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY - MINIMALISM OR OPTIMIZATION, Environmental Engineering and Management Journal, 21, 9, pp. 1533-1543, (2022); Sabki, Mirza Hussein, A review on the economic feasibility of composting for organic waste management in Asian countries, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 70, pp. 49-54, (2018); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Home-Composting - A Study on the Simplicity of the System in the Application toward the Effectiveness and Feasibility in Spreading in Vietnam, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 89, pp. 505-510, (2021)","","Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC","","","","","","22839216","9788895608419; 9788895608372; 9788895608426; 9788895608143; 9788895608051; 9788895608624; 9788895608112; 9788895608617; 9788895608648; 9788895608365","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183477733"

In this study, we explored the preparation of high-quality oil from high-free fatty acid (FFA) vegetable oil using an ammonia/MeOH solvent as an alkali base. Among the six tested solvents, MeOH was the most suitable for the separation of the oil and FFAs. Among the three alkali bases, ammonia enhanced the miscibility of FFAs in MeOH by forming ammonium salts. The amounts of FFAs in the upper layer and oil in the lower layer were positively correlated (r = 0.9348 and 0.9617, respectively) with MeOH. With increasing MeOH concentration, the amount of oil in the lower layer increased along with the FFAs in the upper layer. Using the molar ratio of ammonia to FFA 1:1 and the ratio (v/w) of MeOH to oil 4:3, 91.6% FFAs and 97.8% oil in the upper and lower layers, respectively, were produced from 50% FFA oil. Using a relational expression of FFAs and oil in the upper layer, 97.1% FFAs and 99.6% oil in each layer was obtained from 10% FFA oil. The oil in the lower layer was further purified by extraction with MeOH. This method is easy and efficient for the separation and purification of oil, accompanied by the reuse of reagents with almost no loss of raw materials. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ammonia Base; High-quality Oil; Methanol Solvent; Preparation; Vegetable Oil With High-free Fatty Acid; Ammonia; Methanol; Alkalies; Ammonia; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Methanol; Plant Oils; Solvents; Fatty Acids; Molar Ratio; Organic Solvents; Purification; Salts; Vegetable Oils; Ammonia Base; Fatty Acid Oil; Free Fatty Acid; High Free Fatty Acids; High Quality; High-quality Oil; Methanol Solvent; Preparation; Upper Layer; Vegetable Oil With High-free Fatty Acid; Ammonia; Alkali; Ammonia; Fatty Acid; Methanol; Solvent; Vegetable Oil; Alkalies; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Methanol; Plant Oils; Solvents","Fatty acids; Molar ratio; Organic solvents; Purification; Salts; Vegetable oils; Ammonia base; Fatty acid oil; Free fatty acid; High free fatty acids; High quality; High-quality oil; Methanol solvent; Preparation; Upper layer; Vegetable oil with high-free fatty acid; Ammonia; alkali; ammonia; fatty acid; methanol; solvent; vegetable oil; Alkalies; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Methanol; Plant Oils; Solvents","","ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; methanol, 67-56-1; Alkalies; Ammonia; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Methanol; Plant Oils; Solvents","The current study was financially supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Developmen（t SATREPS, Project: Multi-beneficial Measure for the Mitigation of Climate Change by the Integrated Utilization of Biomass Energy in Vietnam and Indochina countries）, JST-JICA.","Fao Corporate Document Repository; Mathew, Gincy Marina, Recent advances in biodiesel production: Challenges and solutions, Science of the Total Environment, 794, (2021); Clean Skies for Tomorrow Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Toolkit, (2021); Gui, Meei Mei, Feasibility of edible oil vs. non-edible oil vs. waste edible oil as biodiesel feedstock, Energy, 33, 11, pp. 1646-1653, (2008); Leung, Dennis Yiu Cheong, A review on biodiesel production using catalyzed transesterification, Applied Energy, 87, 4, pp. 1083-1095, (2010); Sorda, Giovanni, An overview of biofuel policies across the world, Energy Policy, 38, 11, pp. 6977-6988, (2010); Das, Prantika, Is biofuel expansion in developing countries reasonable?

The graphic simulator utilized the advantages of design software SolidWorks, Catia, and the computing and simulation power of SimMechanics Toolbox in Matlab. The core of the proposed graphic simulator is algorithm to solve the kinematics and dynamic problems of a developing upper-limb rehabilitation robot. The study used the proposed optimization-based algorithm to solve the inverse kinematics (IK) problem for the redundant robot model. Endpoint trajectories were imported from measurement data. The joints variable solutions obtained before entering the dynamics problem were smoothed to ensure feasibility in the later calculation process. A process to solve the inverse dynamics problem using physical model by combining the power of two software SolidWorks and SimMechanics was also proposed. This process ensured that the Robot's design could be changed and updated to the kinematics calculation fast and easily. To evaluate this procedure, we also compared these dynamics results with results when applying the Lagrange-Euler formulation.

For this purpose purpose, by performing a parametric study and using the nonlinear finite element method method, the impact of geometric characteristics of the fiber end on its bonding behavior with UHPC has been studied studied. The cohesive zone model investigates the interface between the fibers and the cement matrix matrix. The mechanical properties of the cohesive zone model are determined by calibrating the finite element results and the experimental fiber pull pull-out te test. AlsoAlso, the results are evaluated with the straight steel fibers outcomes outcomes. Using the novel presented fibers fibers, the bond strength has significantly improved compared to the straight steel fibers fibers. The new proposed fibers increase bond strength by 1 1.1 times f or the same diameter of fibers fibers. By creating fillet at the contact area between the rounded end and the fiber fiber, bond strength is significantly improved improved, the maximum fiber capacity is reachable reachable, and the pull pull-out occurs in the form of fracture and tearing of t he fibers fibers, which is the most desirable bonding mode for fibers fibers. This also improves the energy absorbed by the fibers and is 4 4.4 times more than the corresponding straight fibers fibers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bond Strength; Cnt-reinforced; Novel Steel Fibers; Pull-out Behavior; Uhpc; Bond Strength (materials); Bonding; Carbon Nanotubes; Fiber Bonding; Finite Element Method; High Performance Concrete; Reinforced Plastics; Bond Properties; Bond Strength; Bonding Behavior; Carbon Nanotube-reinforced; Cohesive Zone Model; Concrete Matrix; Matrix; Novel Steel Fiber; Pull-out; Pull-out Behavior; Steel Fibers","Bond strength (materials); Bonding; Carbon nanotubes; Fiber bonding; Finite element method; High performance concrete; Reinforced plastics; Bond properties; Bond strength; Bonding behavior; Carbon nanotube-reinforced; Cohesive zone model; Concrete matrix; matrix; Novel steel fiber; Pull-out; Pull-out behavior; Steel fibers","","","The authors are grateful to Scientific Research Deanship at King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia for their financial support through the Large Research Group Project under grant number (RGP.02-230-43).","Abdallah, Sadoon, Bonding mechanisms and strength of steel fiber-reinforced cementitious composites: Overview, Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 30, 3, (2018); Aghajanian, Ali, Effect of micro-silica addition into electric arc furnace steel slag eco-efficient concrete, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 11, (2021); Aghakhani, Masood, Modeling and optimization of dilution in SAW in the presence of Cr2O3 nano-particles, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 78, 9-12, pp. 1665-1676, (2015); Baniya, Hom Bahadur, Cold atmospheric pressure plasma technology for modifying polymers to enhance adhesion: A critical review, Reviews of Adhesion and Adhesives, 9, 2, pp. 269-307, (2021); Dahi-Taleghani, Arash, Secondary fractures and their potential impacts on hydraulic fractures efficiency, pp. 773-792, (2013); Biodegr, (2022); Dhiman, Navneet Kaur, Role of nanomaterials in protecting building materials from degradation and deterioration, pp. 405-475, (2021); Ding, Xinxin, Synergistic bond properties of different deformed steel fibers embedded in mortars wet-sieved from self-compacting sfrc, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 21, (2021); J Res Sci Eng Technol, (2020); Du, Jiang, New development of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), Composites Part B: Engineering, 224, (2021)","","Techno-Press","","","","","","2287237X; 22872388","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158946016"

Our results show distinct scattering features when varying the various scattering parameters, thereby allowing the identification of the scattering particle with specific application to the identification of atmospheric pollutants including black carbon. Regardless of the type of scatterer, the scattering intensity is nearly uniform with a slight preference for forward scattering when the size of the particle is within 20% of the incident laser’s wavelength. The scattering patterns start to exhibit distinguishable features when the size parameter equals 1.77, corresponding to an incident laser wavelength of 0.355 μm and a particle radius of 0.1 μm. The patterns then become increasingly unique as the size parameter increases. Based on these calculations, we propose a time-gated lidar scheme consisting of multiple detectors that can rotate through a telescopic angle and be placed equidistantly around the scattering particles to collect the backscattered light and a commercially available Q-switched laser system emitting at tunable laser wavelengths. By using a pulsed laser with 10-ns pulse duration, our scheme could distinguish scattering centers that are at least 3 m apart. Our scheme called MIe Scattering Time-gated multi-Static LIDAR (MISTS–LIDAR) would be capable of identifying the type of atmospheric pollutant and mapping its location with a spatial resolution of a few meters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Monitoring Of Pollutants; Black Carbon; Lidar; Mie Scattering; Particulate Matter","","","","This research was funded by the Osaka University ASEAN Campuses, the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under Project No. VAST01.03/22-23 and the Institute of Laser Engineering Collaborative Research Fund (2020B1-003 and 2022B1-004).","undefined; Durdina, Lukas, Nonvolatile Particulate Matter Emissions of a Business Jet Measured at Ground Level and Estimated for Cruising Altitudes, Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 21, pp. 12865-12872, (2019); Panahifar, Hossein, Monitoring atmospheric particulate matters using vertically resolved measurements of a polarization lidar, in-situ recordings and satellite data over Tehran, Iran, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Liu, Zheng, Semi-volatile organic compounds in fine particulate matter on a tropical island in the South China Sea, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 426, (2022); Proceedings of the Awma Specialty Conference Pm 2000; Ross Hallett, F., Particle size analysis by dynamic light scattering, Food Research International, 27, 2, pp. 195-198, (1994); Koestner, Daniel W., Polarized light scattering measurements as a means to characterize particle size and composition of natural assemblages of marine particles, Applied Optics, 59, 27, pp. 8314-8334, (2020); Siebert, Karl J., Relationship of particle size to light scattering, Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists, 58, 3, pp. 97-100, (2000); Lockwood, David J., Rayleigh and Mie Scattering, pp. 1097-1107, (2016); Wyatt, Philip J., Differential light scattering and the measurement of molecules and nanoparticles: A review, Analytica Chimica Acta: X, 7-8, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145843671"

The GWF/PDMS sensor shows a pressure sensitivity of 0.0142 kPa−1 in a wide linearity range of 0–20 kPa, an outstanding Gauge factor (GF) of 582 at a strain of 6.2 %, and a very high positive sensitivity of 0.0238 °C−1 in the temperature range of 25–80 °C. A practical application as a high sensitivity air pressure sensor able to measure low pressures (in the range of Pa to kPa) was also demonstrated.

Employing catalyst supports results in high product selectivity, and nitrogen-doped carbon has attracted significant interest as a catalyst support owing to the effect of nitrogen on the electronic properties. The present study demonstrated the synthesis of a Ni<inf>2</inf>P catalyst on melamine-doped carbon. The synthesized catalyst exhibited high deoxygenation activity, thereby facilitating the integrated catalytic upgradation and pyrolysis of palm kernel shells. Melamine-doped carbon was fabricated via carbonization of melamine-impregnated activated carbon. Subsequently, the Ni<inf>2</inf>P catalyst was loaded via sequential wet impregnation and temperature-programmed reduction. The presence of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>) significantly affected the morphology and electronic properties of Ni<inf>x</inf>P<inf>y</inf>. Complexation between Ni and the N-containing functional groups on the carbon surface resulted in optimal distribution of the Ni<inf>x</inf>P<inf>y</inf> phase along the carbon support. Furthermore, electron transfer from the triazine structure to Ni substantially impacted the deoxygenation activity and the selectivity for aromatic and phenolic compounds.

Various biosensors using the unique optical responses of SWNTs have been proposed by many research groups. Most of these employed either colloidal suspensions of dispersed SWNTs or SWNT films on flat surfaces, such as electrodes. In this study, we attached DNA-wrapped SWNTs (DNA-SWNTs) to frustule (micron-sized nanoporous biosilica) surfaces, which were purified from cultured isolated diatoms. After the injection of an oxidant and a reductant, the SWNTs on the frustules showed prominent PL responses. This suggests that the biodevice functions as a micron-sized redox sensor. Frustules can be easily suspended in aqueous solutions because of their porous structures and can easily be collected as pellets by low-speed centrifugation. Thus, the removal of unbound SWNTs and the recovery of the fabricated DNA-SWNT frustules for reuse were achieved by gentle centrifugation. Our proposal for micron-sized SWNT biodevices would be helpful for various biological applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study was financially supported by JST SICORP Japan (grant number: JPMJSC19E1).","Iverson, Nicole M., In vivo biosensing via tissue-localizable near-infrared-fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes, Nature Nanotechnology, 8, 11, pp. 873-880, (2013); Qian, Hui, Carbon nanotube-based hierarchical composites: A review, Journal of Materials Chemistry, 20, 23, pp. 4751-4762, (2010); Umemura, Kazuo, Hybrids of nucleic acids and carbon nanotubes for nanobiotechnology, Nanomaterials, 5, 1, pp. 321-350, (2014); Ishibashi, Yu, Monitoring the antioxidant effects of catechin using single-walled carbon nanotubes: Comparative analysis by near-infrared absorption and near-infrared photoluminescence, Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 161, pp. 139-146, (2018); Umemura, Kazuo, Quantitative Detection of the Disappearance of the Antioxidant Ability of Catechin by Near-Infrared Absorption and Near-Infrared Photoluminescence Spectra of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes, ACS Omega, 4, 4, pp. 7750-7758, (2019); Zhao, Edward H., Caffeine's antioxidant potency optically sensed with double-stranded DNA-encased single-walled carbon nanotubes, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 119, 10, pp. 4068-4075, (2015); Karachevtsev, Viktor A., Comparative study on protection properties of anionic surfactants (SDS, SDBS) and DNA covering of single-walled carbon nanotubes against pH influence: Luminescence and absorption spectroscopy study, Materialwissenschaft und Werkstofftechnik, 42, 1, pp. 41-46, (2011); Liu, Shuhan, NIR initiated and pH sensitive single-wall carbon nanotubes for doxorubicin intracellular delivery, Journal of Materials Chemistry B, 2, 9, pp. 1125-1135, (2014); Wang, Lei, NIR-/pH-Responsive drug delivery of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes for potential application in cancer chemo-photothermal therapy, Pharmaceutical Research, 30, 11, pp. 2757-2771, (2013); Card, Matthew, A Spin-Coated Hydrogel Platform Enables Accurate Investigation of Immobilized Individual Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 13, 27, pp. 31986-31995, (2021)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","24701343","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143895683"

We recently found that CCL4/MIP-1β—a specific ligand for CCR5 receptors—was implicated in eosinophil recruitment into the inflammatory site and was substantially released from activated eosinophils. Moreover, it was found in nasal polyps from patients with ECRS, primarily in epithelial cells. In the present study, the role of epithelial cell-derived CCL4 in eosinophil activation was investigated. First, CCL4 expression in nasal polyps from patients with ECRS as well as its role of CCL4 in eosinophilic airway inflammation were investigated in an in vivo model. Furthermore, the role of CCL4 in CD69 expression—a marker of activated eosinophils—as well as the signaling pathways involved in CCL4-mediated eosinophil activation were investigated. Notably, CCL4 expression, but not CCL5, CCL11, or CCL26, was found to be significantly increased in nasal polyps from patients with ECRS associated with eosinophil infiltration as well as in BEAS-2B cells co-incubated with eosinophils. In an OVA-induced allergic mouse model, CCL4 increased eosinophil accumulation in the nasal mucosa and the bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF). Moreover, we found that CD69 expression was upregulated in CCL4-stimulated eosinophils; similarly, phosphorylation of several kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)β, SRC kinase family (Lck, Src, and Yes), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), was upregulated. Further, CCR5, PDGFRβ, and/or Src kinase inhibition partially restored CCL4-induced CD69 upregulation. Thus, CCL4, which is derived from airway epithelial cells, plays a role in the accumulation and activation of eosinophils at inflammatory sites. These findings may provide a novel therapeutic target for eosinophilic airway inflammation, such as ECRS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Airway Inflammation; Ccl4; Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis; Eosinophils; Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1beta; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase; Protein Kinase; Protein Kinase Lck; Cd69 Antigen; Eotaxin; Eotaxin 3; Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1beta; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase; Platelet Derived Growth Factor Beta Receptor; Protein Kinase; Protein Kinase Lck; Protein Kinase Src; Protein Kinase Yes; Rantes; Unclassified Drug; Adult; Airway; Airway Epithelium Cell; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Beas-2b Cell Line; Cell Activation; Chronic Rhinosinusitis; Controlled Study; Enzyme Inhibition; Eosinophil; Eosinophilia; Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis; Female; Human; Human Cell; Immunofluorescence Assay; In Vivo Study; Lung Lavage; Mouse; Nasal Tissue; Nonhuman; Nose Mucosa; Nose Polyp; Respiratory Tract Inflammation; Signal Transduction; Upregulation; Animal; Chronic Disease; Complication; Inflammation; Metabolism; Pathology; Rhinitis; Sinusitis; Animals; Chronic Disease; Eosinophilia; Eosinophils; Inflammation; Mice; Nasal Polyps; Rhinitis; Sinusitis","CD69 antigen; eotaxin; eotaxin 3; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; mitogen activated protein kinase; platelet derived growth factor beta receptor; protein kinase; protein kinase Lck; protein kinase Src; protein kinase Yes; RANTES; unclassified drug; adult; airway; airway epithelium cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; BEAS-2B cell line; cell activation; chronic rhinosinusitis; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; eosinophil; eosinophilia; eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis; female; human; human cell; immunofluorescence assay; in vivo study; lung lavage; mouse; nasal tissue; nonhuman; nose mucosa; nose polyp; respiratory tract inflammation; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; chronic disease; complication; inflammation; metabolism; pathology; rhinitis; sinusitis; Animals; Chronic Disease; Eosinophilia; Eosinophils; Inflammation; Mice; Nasal Polyps; Rhinitis; Sinusitis","","macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, 122071-81-2; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; protein kinase, 9026-43-1; protein kinase Lck, 114051-78-4","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (19K07949) from the Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the fund from the Academic Society for Research in Otolaryngology, Kansai Medical University and a grant “Private University Research Branding Project on intractable immune and allergic diseases” from Kansai Medical University.","Ishitoya, Junichi, Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis in Japan, Allergology International, 59, 3, pp. 239-245, (2010); Sachio, Takeno, Pathological mechanisms and clinical features of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis in the Japanese population, Allergology International, 59, 3, pp. 247-256, (2010); Fujieda, Shigeharu, Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, Allergology International, 68, 4, pp. 403-412, (2019); Tokunaga, Takahiro, Novel scoring system and algorithm for classifying chronic rhinosinusitis: The JESREC Study, Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 70, 8, pp. 995-1003, (2015); Nakayama, Tsuguhisa, JESREC score and mucosal eosinophilia can predict endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, Auris Nasus Larynx, 46, 3, pp. 374-383, (2019); Kobayashi, Yoshiki, Reduced local response to corticosteroids in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with asthma, Biomolecules, 10, 2, (2020); Meng, Juan, The development of nasal polyp disease involves early nasal mucosal inflammation and remodelling, PLOS ONE, 8, 12, (2013); Takabayashi, Tetsuji, Formation of nasal polyps: The roles of innate type 2 inflammation and deposition of fibrin, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 145, 3, pp. 740-750, (2020); Shah, Said Ahmad, Pathogenesis of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, Journal of Inflammation (United Kingdom), 13, 1, (2016); Proost, Paul, The role of chemokines in inflammation, International Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Research, 26, 4, pp. 211-223, (1996)","","MDPI","","","","","","14220067; 16616596","","","36555793","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144512075"

The exciton appearance and disappearance in the isotropic strained WS<inf>2</inf> are discussed. Thanks to the spin splitting by SOC effect, light and dark excitons are visually shown. Under strain, the flattening of the band valleys may lead to the disappearance of excitons, causing the direct-to-indirect transition of the band gap. Furthermore, the vertical shift of electron orbitals at band edges can result in a notable reduction in the band gap.

A Rover 1S/60 gas turbine engine was used for recording performance parameters and emissions. Soot characteristics were investigated in smoke-free coannular wick-fed diffusion flames. This study is the next step that must be performed in the certification process of a new aviation biofuel before it is tested in the aircraft. The results show that BK-5 produced a similar performance against Jet A1. Throughout the whole power range under investigation, BK-5 emitted 3.4% NOx higher than Jet A1, while Jet A1 released CO and HC at the rates that are, respectively, 1.8 and 4.5% greater than its counterpart. The soot emissions from the BK-5 and Jet A1 were comparable across the measured flame height range. The results encouraged future studies to carry out the modern engine and flight tests. The production process for bioparaffins employed in this work has been demonstrated to be viable and appropriate for tropical developing nations. The current process should also continue to be improved by eliminating high-distillation temperature components in bioparaffins. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) funded this study through the project of the ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net).

In this process, bulk MoS<inf>2</inf>and graphite foil served as the sources of MoS<inf>2</inf>and graphene nanosheets, respectively, while glucose and thiourea served as the source of NSCD. The sturdy integration of 0D NSCD and 2D MoS<inf>2</inf>/G in a well-constructed ternary composite provided a huge number of edge active sites with tunable and extraordinary physicochemical properties for electron transport, facilitating HER performance. The optimal NSCD@MoS<inf>2</inf>/G exhibited a superior catalytic activity toward HER with a low onset potential (37 mV), an overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and a Tafel slope as small as 53 mV dec-1, which were better than other 2D electrocatalysts. The increase in double-layer capacitance for NSCD@MoS<inf>2</inf>/G (12.2 mF cm-2), which was 2-fold of the MoS<inf>2</inf>/G sample, is strong evidence of the large catalytic edge sites and electrical coupling in the NSCD@MoS<inf>2</inf>/G ternary system. Moreover, the strong bonding and interaction between NSCD and MoS<inf>2</inf>/G nanosheets enabled outstanding long-term stability and structural integrity, displaying 95 and 90% activity retention at 10 and 50 mA cm-2after 48 h i-t test, respectively.

Herein, we propose a facile strategy to improve the breakdown strength and thus energy density by synergistically designing the intermolecular structure in a ternary polymer blend composed of poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(vinylidene fluoride), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene). We show that the appropriate quenching temperature can decrease crystal size and increase the fraction of the amorphous phase. Meanwhile, by designing the mass ratio of the ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene), it will successfully introduce the intermolecular interaction, which stabilizes the γ-phase in ferroelectric polymers and leads to dense chain packing. All the phenomena contribute to the ultrahigh breakdown strength (850 MV/m), and the optimized blend exhibits a record high discharged energy density of 30 J/cm3. Of particular importance is that a large-area dielectric film with high property uniformity can be fabricated, demonstrating that the proposed design approach can be used as a general technology for mass production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Excellent Discharged Energy Density; Intermolecular Structure; Polymer Dielectric Film; Ternary Polymer Blends; Ultrahigh Breakdown Strength; Dielectric Films; Esters; Ferroelectricity; Fluorine Compounds; Nanocomposites; Polymer Blends; Breakdown Strengths; Discharged Energy Densities; Energy Density; Excellent Discharged Energy Density; Intermolecular Structures; Poly(vinylidene Fluoride); Polymer Dielectric Film; Polymer Dielectrics; Ternary Polymer Blends; Ultrahigh Breakdown Strength; Electric Breakdown","Dielectric films; Esters; Ferroelectricity; Fluorine compounds; Nanocomposites; Polymer blends; Breakdown strengths; Discharged energy densities; Energy density; Excellent discharged energy density; Intermolecular structures; Poly(vinylidene fluoride); Polymer dielectric film; Polymer dielectrics; Ternary polymer blends; Ultrahigh breakdown strength; Electric breakdown","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51672092 , U1732117 , 51902111 , and 52002300 ), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2019 M662602), DongGuan Innovative Research Team Program, the Open Fund of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Information Materials (No.191015-K), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation: 2021A1515010025, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2021yjsCXCY029, 2021yjsCXCY027).

In a batch experiment, 10 g·L-1 of Fe3O4 was confirmed to be optimal to this type of wastewater treatment. Therefore, this concentration was chosen for the follow-up experiment with a continuous system of 10 L anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR). The ABR was run at 30 with a hydraulic retention time of 18.6 h for 170 days. Fe3O4 was added to each ABR compartment at 10 g·L-1 from day 105. The Fe3O4 supplement significantly enhanced ABR treatment performance. With influent color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels of 1300 Pt-Co and 305 mgCOD·L-1, their removal efficiencies increased remarkably from 44% and 42% in the Fe3O4-free phase to 85% and 76% in the Fe3O4-added phase, respectively. Interestingly, the ratio of generated methane on removed COD in Fe3O4-involved phases were lower than that in Fe3O4-free phase, suggesting a preference of the ABR for decolorization over methanogenesis in an iron-rich condition. Microbial community analysis revealed that Fe3O4 may have immensely contributed to dyeing degradation process through the selective enrichment of key substrate-fermenting and dye-degrading bacteria, especially Clostridium spp. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic Baffled Reactor; Azo Dye; Dyeing Wastewater; Ferroferric Oxide; Microbial Community Analysis; Binary Alloys; Biodegradation; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Cobalt Alloys; Dyeing; Magnetite; Microorganisms; Platinum Alloys; Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Baffled Reactor; Anaerobics; Azo-dyes; Biotreatments; Chemical-oxygen Demands; Dyeing Wastewater; Ferroferric Oxides; Free Phase; Microbial Community Analysis; Treatment Performance; Azo Dyes","Binary alloys; Biodegradation; Chemical oxygen demand; Cobalt alloys; Dyeing; Magnetite; Microorganisms; Platinum alloys; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic baffled reactor; Anaerobics; Azo-dyes; Biotreatments; Chemical-oxygen demands; Dyeing wastewater; Ferroferric oxides; Free phase; Microbial community analysis; Treatment performance; Azo dyes","","","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Takahiro Watari reports financial support was provided by Government of Japan Ministry of the Environment.

Recently, the solar steam generation (SSG) based on biomass has already attracted a great deal of interest because of its effectiveness and eco-friendliness. In this study, a novel photothermal material for SSG was fabricated by treating fingered citron (FC) with natural polyphenols from green tea extract (GTE) and then with Fe (III) solution to form nano layers of Fe (III) complex on FC surface. Consequently, the developed FC based photothermal material (FCP) exhibited high light absorption capacity. Thanks to its unique structure with honeycomb-like porous pith and scattered linear vascular bundles and hydrophilic property, FCP possessed essential features for good performance of SSG including excellent water transportation, low thermal conductivity, high salt rejection capacity, and stable operation. The FCP based SSG system demonstrated a water evaporation rate of 1.92 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination, which is comparable or even superior to those of the reported biomass-based photothermal materials. The simple, cost-effective, and green FCP fabrication technology together with the high water evaporation performance of the FCP based SSG highlight the promising application of FCP in SSG toward sustainable seawater desalination. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass Based Photothermal Material; Fingered Citron; Green Tea Extract; Metal-polyphenol Complex Nanoparticles; Seawater Desalination; Cost Effectiveness; Evaporation; Extraction; Iron Compounds; Light Absorption; Metal Nanoparticles; Seawater; Biomass Based Photothermal Material; Complex Nanoparticles; Fingered Citra; Green Tea Extracts; Metal-polyphenol Complex Nanoparticle; Photo-thermal; Polyphenols; Seawater Desalination; Solar Steam; Steam Generation; Biomass; Absorption; Biomass; Coating; Desalination; Evaporation; Iron; Phenol; Seawater; Sustainability; Tea","Cost effectiveness; Evaporation; Extraction; Iron compounds; Light absorption; Metal nanoparticles; Seawater; Biomass based photothermal material; Complex nanoparticles; Fingered citra; Green tea extracts; Metal-polyphenol complex nanoparticle; Photo-thermal; Polyphenols; Seawater desalination; Solar steam; Steam generation; Biomass; absorption; biomass; coating; desalination; evaporation; iron; phenol; seawater; sustainability; tea","","","The main part of this work was performed in the Laboratory of Master's Program in Nanotechnology, VNU Vietnam Japan University.","Delyannis, Emmy E., Historic background of desalination and renewable energies, Solar Energy, 75, 5, pp. 357-366, (2003); Cao, Sisi, Advances in solar evaporator materials for freshwater generation, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 7, 42, pp. 24092-24123, (2019); Albert, James S., Scientists’ warning to humanity on the freshwater biodiversity crisis, Ambio, 50, 1, pp. 85-94, (2021); Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa, A review of renewable energy sources, sustainability issues and climate change mitigation, Cogent Engineering, 3, 1, (2016); Satoh, Yusuke, Multi-model and multi-scenario assessments of Asian water futures: The Water Futures and Solutions (WFaS) initiative, Earth's Future, 5, 7, pp. 823-852, (2017); Li, Zhengtong, Solar-Powered Sustainable Water Production: State-of-the-Art Technologies for Sunlight-Energy-Water Nexus, ACS Nano, 15, 8, pp. 12535-12566, (2021); Ahmed, Farah Ejaz, Solar powered desalination – Technology, energy and future outlook, Desalination, 453, pp. 54-76, (2019); Arunkumar, T., A review on carbonized natural green flora for solar desalination, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 158, (2022); Zhu, Mengmeng, Carbonized daikon for high efficient solar steam generation, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 191, pp. 83-90, (2019); Adv Fiber Mater, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00119164","","DSLNA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130785023"

Column-type CWs (ID 12.5 cm, H 50 cm) filled with clamshells or gravel were planted with cattails. Synthesized AMD containing 20 mg/L zinc (Zn), 0.3 mg/L cadmium (Cd), 20 mg/L copper (Cu), 1.1 mg/L lead (Pb), 0.6 mg/L manganese (Mn), and other minerals (pH=4.1) was fed to CWs (1 L/column) with hydraulic retention times of 2–7 days in sequencing batch mode. Results indicated higher metal removal in clamshell-based CWs with the pH neutralization than in gravel-based CWs. The removal efficiencies were 85.3–92.6%, 84.1–98.3%, 96.5–99.7%, 98.3–99.1%, and 64.0–83.8%, respectively, for Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Mn. During 6 months of operation, 790.7 mg of Zn, 10.6 mg of Cd, 762.4 mg of Cu, 40.1 mg of Pb, and 19.9 mg of Mn were fed to each CW. Of those, retaining in the substrate was the main metal removal route, representing 49.7–82.5%, followed by plant uptake (16.1–39.0%), and other processes (0.6–3.2%). The metal contents in the clamshell were increased, although that of calcium was lowered after treatment. The clamshell-based CWs extended the cattail root and incubated sulfate-reducing bacteria in a larger population.

Plasma-liquid interactions (PLIs) have the unique ability to synthesize GNPs without using any reducing agents, and the GNP surface is free of stabilizing agents. It is an extreme advantage that ensures success for the subsequent functionalization processes for GNPs. However, fabricating GNPs via PLIs at the desired size has still been a challenge. Here, we present a simple approach to achieving the precise size-control of GNPs synthesized by PLIs. By adding suitable ligands to the precursor solution, the ligands wrap GNPs which interrupts and slows down the rapid growth of GNPs under PLIs. This way, the size of the GNPs can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ligand concentration. Our results showed that the size of the GNPs in the range of 10-60 nm can be fitted to reciprocal functions of the ligand concentration. The potency of the size-control depends on the type of ligands in the order of thiol > amine > carboxylate. The size-control has been well investigated with four common ligands: l-cysteine, glucosamine, salicylic acid, and terephthalic acid. XPS, FTIR, and zeta potential techniques confirmed the presence of these ligands on GNPs. The results indicated that functionalized ligands could be utilized to control the size and functionalize the GNP surface. Hence our approach could simultaneously achieve two goals: precise size-control and functionalization of GNPs without the ligand-exchange step. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amino Acids; Carboxylation; Fiber Optic Sensors; Ligands; Metal Nanoparticles; Reducing Agents; Salicylic Acid; Synthesis (chemical); Functionalizations; Gold Nanoparticle; Gold Nanoparticles; High Standards; Ligand Concentration; Liquid Interactions; Nanoparticle Surface; Plasma Liquid; Size-control; Synthesised; Gold Nanoparticles","Amino acids; Carboxylation; Fiber optic sensors; Ligands; Metal nanoparticles; Reducing agents; Salicylic acid; Synthesis (chemical); Functionalizations; Gold nanoparticle; Gold Nanoparticles; High standards; Ligand concentration; Liquid interactions; Nanoparticle surface; Plasma liquid; Size-control; Synthesised; Gold nanoparticles","","","The authors thank Ms Nguyen Thu Huong and other Aqua and Soil Environment Laboratory members at the Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan, for their support during sample preparation.

Driven piles are often used in large volumes for infrastructure and industrial projects in rural areas. Unlike other installation methods, installing piles using impact hammers can generate tensile stress during construction, which can result in pile failures. Induced tensile stress occurs when piles are being driven through a hard soil layer to a softer soil layer, and transverse cracks happen when induced tensile stress exceeds the pile tensile strength. This issue is not explicitly stated in most standards; the rare code that mentions this issue is AASHTO 2014. AASHTO 2014 uses correlations between the concrete tensile and compressive strengths to obtain the pile tensile strength. However, data collected from more than 1300 tests on the correlations between the concrete tensile and compressive strengths show that the concrete pile tensile strengths obtained using AASHTO 2014 are significantly conservative. This paper provides an adjustment in the correlation for the tensile strength based on previous data, and it proposes an approach to estimate the tensile strength for concrete-driven piles. A case study of the effects of pile failures on the tensile strength is also presented to verify the approach. The obtained tensile strength from the proposed approach agrees well with the measured field data. For the case study, the pile tensile strength obtained using the proposed approach is 38% and 59% higher than the tensile strength obtained using AASHTO 2014. These quantities are significant but may vary, depending on the compression strength of the concrete used and the pile configurations. The proposed approach better predicts the tensile strength of concrete piles and can lead to cost savings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concrete Piles; Driven-pile Installation; Pile Driving Analyzer (pda); Tensile Stress","","","","","Likins, Garland E., Pile damage prevention and assessment using dynamic monitoring and the beta method, Geotechnical Special Publication, 233, pp. 428-442, (2014); Pile Driving Analysis by One Dimensional Wave Theory State of the Art, (1970); Research Report Number 33 3 Piling Behavior, (1966); Allowable Stresses in Piles, (1983); Aashto Lrfd Bridge Design Specifications, (2014); Geotechnical Engineering Circular no 12 Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations, (2016); Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete ACI 318 2002, (2008); undefined, (2003); undefined, (2004); Guidelines for Control of Cracking of Mass Concrete 2016, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137371665"

Materials and methods: A training dataset consisting of 1902 photos of the smooth surface of teeth taken with an iPhone 7 from 695 people was used. Four deep learning models, consisting of Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNNs), You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3), RetinaNet, and Single-Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD), were tested to detect initial caries lesions and cavities. The reference standard was the diagnosis of a dentist based on image examination according to the International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS) classification. Results: For cavitated caries, YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN showed the highest sensitivity among the four tested models, at 87.4% and 71.4%, respectively. The sensitivity levels of these two models were only 36.9 % and 26% for visually non-cavitated (VNC). The specificity of the four models reached above 86% for cavitated caries and above 71% for VNC. Conclusion: The clinical application of YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN models for diagnosing dental caries via smartphone images was promising. The current study provides a preliminary insight into the potential translation of AI from the laboratory to clinical practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Caries Detection; Deep Learning; Image Analysis","","","","","James, Spencer Lewis, Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 354 Diseases and Injuries for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, The Lancet, 392, 10159, pp. 1789-1858, (2018); Strategies and Educational Manuals to Improve National Oral Examination Program, (2009); Kandelman, Daniel P., Oral health care systems in developing and developed countries, Periodontology 2000, 60, 1, pp. 98-109, (2012); Choi, Jinwoo, Assessment of panoramic radiography as a national oral examination tool: Review of the literature, Imaging Science in Dentistry, 41, 1, pp. 1-6, (2011); Benzian, Habib, Putting teeth into chronic diseases, The Lancet, 377, 9764, (2011); Hwang, Jae Joon, An overview of deep learning in the field of dentistry, Imaging Science in Dentistry, 49, 1, pp. 1-7, (2019); Tamaki, Yoh, Construction of a dental caries prediction model by data mining., Journal of Oral Science, 51, 1, pp. 61-68, (2009); Patil, Shashikant, Algorithmic analysis for dental caries detection using an adaptive neural network architecture, Heliyon, 5, 5, (2019); PRADOS PRIVADO, MARIA, Dental caries diagnosis and detection using neural networks: A systematic review, Journal of Clinical Medicine, 9, 11, (2020); Moutselos, Konstantinos, Recognizing Occlusal Caries in Dental Intraoral Images Using Deep Learning, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, pp. 1617-1620, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131506965"

In this study, a compact package-type down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) operating system based on the trickling filter principle using polyurethane sponge media was designed and installed at a sewage treatment site in Thailand. The DHS system was installed within 14 d of material arrival and operated for 81 d without seed sludge inoculation. The T-BOD concentration of the DHS effluent reached 2.2 mg·L−1 after 6 d of operation. High nitrification activity of the DHS reactor, when operated with a hydraulic retention time of 3.7 ± 0.9 h, was observed after 13 d of operation. In addition, the DHS effluent achieved the discharge standard within 14 d of operation. The DHS reactor rapidly initiated the removal of organics and nitrogen and exhibited COD, TSS, and ammonia removal efficiencies of 58% ± 10%, 76% ± 21%, and 66% ± 32%, respectively. Parallel 16S rRNA gene sequencing of sludge revealed the rapid growth of nitrifying bacteria. The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria Nitrosomonas spp. ranged from 0.1% to 1.8% on day 18, indicating that the DHS sponge media effectively retained slow-growth nitrifying bacteria that were affected by the rapid start-up process. Nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira sp. was mainly detected at the bottom of the reactor. These results show that the compact package-type DHS system is a novel and practical easy-contract sewage treatment method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Municipal Wastewater; Nitrifying Bacteria; Sponge-based Tricking Filter","","","","This research was financially supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [grant numbers 16H02371 and 17H06703 ].

However, impact of continuous dose of vanillin on treatment performance and microbial activities in MBR are still unknown. In this study, effects of vanillin on production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial community was investigated in lab-scale MBR under continuous dose of vanillin. Vanillin dose remarkably reduced membrane fouling in accordance with less development of cake layer. It was probably because bulk sludge contained more hydrophilic components and became less adhesive by lower abundance of Xanthomonadaceae and Chitonophagaceae, which are known to produce viscous EPS and hydrophobic lipopolysaccharides. In addition, filtration resistance of cake layer was probably reduced by less contents of SMP and LB-EPS due to inhibition of Flavobacterium and Xanthomonadaceae, which are biofilm forming bacteria and EPS producers. These results suggest that interference to microbial activity by continuous dose of vanillin alters characteristics of sludge EPS, thus effectively mitigate biofouling in MBR. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioactive Substances; Extracellular Polymeric Substances; Membrane Bioreactor; Quorum Sensing; Size-polarity Matrix","","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists A (Grant No. 15H05535), Fostering Joint International Research (Grant No. 16KK0146), JST Mirai Program (Grant No. JPMJMI18DC) and Kurita Water and Environment Foundation.

ADHD symptoms were assessed using an ADHD rating scale with inattention and hyperactivity-and-impulsivity (hyperactivity) subscales. Autistic behaviors were evaluated using the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS). Perinatal dioxin exposure was indicated by dioxin levels in maternal breast milk. In boys, hyperactivity scores were significantly higher in the high 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) group only at 5 years of age. In girls, hyperactivity scores at 8 years of age were significantly higher in the high TCDD group, which was significantly associated with those at 5 years of age. In girls, ASRS unusual behavior scores were significantly higher with higher TCDD exposure and hyperactivity scores at 8 years of age.

Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we investigated the degrees of LF hypertrophy in 18 patients without scoliosis and on the convex and concave sides of the apex of the curvature in 22 patients with AIS. Next, gene expression was compared among neutral vertebral LF and LF on the convex and concave sides of the apex of the curvature in patients with AIS. Histological and microarray analyses of the LF were compared among neutral vertebrae (control) and the LF on the apex of the curvatures. The mean area of LF in the without scoliosis, apical concave, and convex with scoliosis groups was 10.5, 13.5, and 20.3 mm2, respectively. There were significant differences among the three groups (p < 0.05). Histological analysis showed that the ratio of fibers (Collagen/Elastic) was significantly increased on the convex side compared to the concave side (p < 0.05). Microarray analysis showed that ERC2 and MAFB showed significantly increased gene expression on the convex side compared with those of the concave side and the neutral vertebral LF cells. These genes were significantly associated with increased expression of collagen by LF cells (p < 0.05). LF hypertrophy was identified in scoliosis patients, and the convex side was significantly more hypertrophic than that of the concave side. ERC2 and MAFB genes were associated with LF hypertrophy in patients with AIS. These phenomena are likely to be associated with the progression of scoliosis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis; Elastic Fiber; Interleukin-6; Ligamentum Flavum; Microarray Analysis; Tgf-β Signaling; Collagen; Synapse Vincent; Col1a2 Protein; Col2a1 Protein; Col3a1 Protein; Collagen; Interleukin 6; Transcription Factor Mafb; Transforming Growth Factor Beta1; Unclassified Drug; Adolescent; Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis; Adult; Article; Child; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Disease Exacerbation; Erc2 Gene; Female; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Human; Human Cell; Human Tissue; Ligament Disease; Ligamentum Flavum Hypertrophy; Male; Microarray Analysis; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pathogenesis; Protein Expression; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; School Child; Young Adult; Diagnostic Imaging; Genetics; Hypertrophy; Ligamentum Flavum; Metabolism; Scoliosis; Adolescent; Gene Expression; Humans; Hypertrophy; Ligamentum Flavum; Microarray Analysis; Scoliosis","col1a2 protein; col2a1 protein; col3a1 protein; collagen; interleukin 6; transcription factor MafB; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; adolescent; adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; adult; Article; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; erc2 gene; female; gene; gene expression; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; human tissue; ligament disease; ligamentum flavum hypertrophy; male; microarray analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathogenesis; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; school child; young adult; diagnostic imaging; genetics; hypertrophy; ligamentum flavum; metabolism; scoliosis; Adolescent; Gene Expression; Humans; Hypertrophy; Ligamentum Flavum; Microarray Analysis; Scoliosis","","collagen, 9007-34-5","","Kane, William J., Scoliosis Prevalence: a call for a statement of terms, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, No. 126, pp. 43-46, (1977); Newton, Peter O., Results of preoperative pulmonary function testing of adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis: A study of six hundred and thirty-one patients, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 87, 9 I, pp. 1937-1946, (2005); Théroux, Jean, Back Pain Prevalence Is Associated with Curve-type and Severity in Adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis, Spine, 42, 15, pp. E914-E919, (2017); Lonstein, John E., Scoliosis: Surgical versus nonsurgical treatment, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 443, pp. 248-259, (2006); Canavese, Federico, Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: Indications and efficacy of nonoperative treatment, Indian Journal of Orthopaedics, 45, 1, pp. 7-14, (2011); Coe, Jeffrey D., Complications in spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in the new millennium.

Compared with the control, the STB reactor enhanced the reduction of persistent organics by 11% based on the double exponential decay model. Besides, the removal of NH<inf>4</inf>+-N is 26% higher, satisfying the first-order decay model. The nitrification was inhibited entirely in control during 48 h, whilst the assimilation process involved 55% of total nitrogen removal. In the STB reactor, nitrification occurred after 12 h, resulting in significantly increased NO<inf>2</inf>–-N and NO<inf>3</inf>–-N concentrations according to the logistic function. Although nitrification was successfully activated, C/N ratios and free ammonia were identified as limiting factors for STB activity, requiring mitigation strategies in further studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Double Exponential Decay Model; First-order Decay Model; Logistic Regression; Membrane Bioreactor; Nitrification; Salt-tolerant Bacteria; Nitrogen; Ammonia; Nitrite; Ammonia; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Waste Water; Ammonia; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Decay (organic); Degradation; Nitrification; Nitrogen Removal; Wastewater Treatment; Decay Model; Degradation Kinetics; Double Exponential; Double Exponential Decay Model; Exponential Decay Models; First-order Decay Model; First-order Decays; Salt Tolerant; Salt-tolerant Bacteria; Tannery Wastewater Treatment; Bioreactors; Nitrogen; Phosphorus Derivative; Ammonia; Nitrite; Biodegradation; Bioreactor; Comparative Advantage; Comparative Study; Membrane; Microbial Activity; Microbial Community; Pollutant Removal; Reaction Kinetics; Wastewater Treatment; Article; Biodegradability; Biomass; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Controlled Study; Degradation Kinetics; Denitrification; Disaster Mitigation; Growth Rate; Heterotrophy; Leather Industry; Municipal Solid Waste; Nitrification; Nitrifying Bacterium; Nitrobacter; Nitrosomonas; Nonhuman; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Chemistry; Pollutant; Salt Tolerance; Suspended Particulate Matter; Tannery Wastewater; Waste Water Management; Kinetics; Nonlinear System; Wastewater; Water Management; Kinetics; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Nonlinear Dynamics; Waste Water; Water Purification","Ammonia; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Decay (organic); Degradation; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Decay model; Degradation kinetics; Double exponential; Double exponential decay model; Exponential decay models; First-order decay model; First-order decays; Salt tolerant; Salt-tolerant bacteria; Tannery wastewater treatment; Bioreactors; nitrogen; phosphorus derivative; ammonia; nitrite; biodegradation; bioreactor; comparative advantage; comparative study; membrane; microbial activity; microbial community; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; wastewater treatment; Article; biodegradability; biomass; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; degradation kinetics; denitrification; disaster mitigation; growth rate; heterotrophy; leather industry; municipal solid waste; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; Nitrobacter; Nitrosomonas; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; physical chemistry; pollutant; salt tolerance; suspended particulate matter; tannery wastewater; waste water management; kinetics; nonlinear system; wastewater; water management; Kinetics; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Nonlinear Dynamics; Waste Water; Water Purification","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrite, 14797-65-0; Ammonia; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Waste Water","We acknowledge the support of time and facilities from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for this study.

A gram-positive rubber-degrading bacterium, Rhodococcus sp. strain RDE2, was isolated from the waste of a rubber-processing factory in Vietnam. This strain grew on natural rubber as a sole source of carbon and energy and produced oligo-isoprenoid metabolites containing aldehyde groups from poly(cis-1,4-isoprene). To identify the genes responsible for poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation, the complete genome sequence of this strain was determined. The complete genome sequence consists of a 5,715,406 bp chromosome and 6 plasmids (GenBank accession numbers AP025186.1 to AP025192.1) with an average GC content of 67.9%. The genome contains 5358 protein-coding sequences and 12 and 68 copies of rRNA and tRNA genes, respectively. Based on genome sequence analysis, the lcp gene (RDE2_08,770), responsible for the initial step of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation, was identified. The gene product obtained from Escherichia coli depolymerizes poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) to low-molecular-weight oligo-isoprenoids. The transcription of this gene is activated during the utilization of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in strain RDE2. The lcpR gene (RDE2_08,760), which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator, is located upstream of lcp. The lcpR gene product recognizes the promoter region of lcp. When the lcpR gene is deleted, the constitutive transcription of lcp is observed. Thus, it is inferred that the LcpR negatively regulates lcp transcription. These results strongly suggest that the lcp and lcpR genes are involved in poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) utilization in strain RDE2. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complete Genome Sequence; Natural Rubber; Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene); Rhodococcus; Tetr/acrr-type Transcriptional Regulator; Rubber; 1,4-polyisoprene; Bacterial Proteins; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber; Biodegradation; Escherichia Coli; Lipids; Metabolites; Rna; Rubber Products; Waste Treatment; Complete Genome Sequence; Complete Genomes; Gene Products; Genome Sequences; Isoprenoids; Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene); Rhodococcus; Rhodococcus Sp; Tetr/acrr-type Transcriptional Regulator; Transcriptional Regulator; Transcription; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterium Isolation; Controlled Study; Gene Identification; Gene Product; Gene Sequence; Genetic Analysis; Genetic Transcription; Lcpr Gene; Microbial Degradation; Nonhuman; Plasmid; Promoter Region; Rna Gene; Viet Nam; Bioremediation; Genetics; Gram Positive Bacterium; Metabolism; 1,4-polyisoprene; Bacterial Protein; Hemiterpene; Latex; Rubber; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Gram-positive Bacteria; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber","Biodegradation; Escherichia coli; Lipids; Metabolites; RNA; Rubber products; Waste treatment; Complete genome sequence; Complete genomes; Gene products; Genome sequences; Isoprenoids; Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene); Rhodococcus; Rhodococcus sp; Tetr/acrr-type transcriptional regulator; Transcriptional regulator; Transcription; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium isolation; controlled study; gene identification; gene product; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; lcpR gene; microbial degradation; nonhuman; plasmid; promoter region; RNA gene; Viet Nam; bioremediation; genetics; Gram positive bacterium; metabolism; 1,4-polyisoprene; bacterial protein; hemiterpene; latex; rubber; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber","","rubber, 9006-04-6; 1,4-polyisoprene; Bacterial Proteins; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber","Funding text 1: We are indebted to Prof. Dr. Seiichi Kawahara of Nagaoka University of Technology for the provision of natural rubber latex and DPNR.

However, the relatively low energy density demands more efforts to meet the lightweight and compact requirement for practical applications. Here, we report sandwich-structured nanocomposite films with strawberry-like Ag@SrTiO<inf>3</inf> nanofillers. The introduction of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on SrTiO<inf>3</inf> NPs could significantly improve dielectric properties, breakdown strength, energy storage density, and efficiency. As a result, a dramatically enhanced discharged energy density (24.6 J/cm3) and efficiency (86.3%) are reached in sandwich-structured nanocomposite films containing 1.5 wt% Ag@SrTiO<inf>3</inf> nanofillers by the solution casting method. The enhancement of dielectric constant and breakdown strength of nanocomposite films is attributed to the Coulomb-blockade effect of Ag NPs, which inhibits the transformation of electrons. Our finite element simulation explicitly demonstrates that the Coulomb-blockade effect of Ag NPs can effectively improve energy storage performance, which therefore supports the experimental results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dielectric Nanocomposite Films; Energy Storage Performance; Sandwich-structured; Strawberry-like; Dielectric Properties Of Solids; Electric Breakdown; Energy Storage; Nanocomposite Films; Nanocomposites; Silver Nanoparticles; Strontium Titanates; Breakdown Strengths; Coulomb Blockade Effects; Dielectric Capacitors; Energy Storage Performance; High-power-density; Nanofiller; Research Efforts; Sandwich-structured; Storage Performance; Strawberry-like; Fruits","Dielectric properties of solids; Electric breakdown; Energy storage; Nanocomposite films; Nanocomposites; Silver nanoparticles; Strontium titanates; Breakdown strengths; Coulomb blockade effects; Dielectric capacitors; Energy storage performance; High-power-density; Nanofiller; Research efforts; Sandwich-structured; Storage performance; Strawberry-like; Fruits","","","The authors thank the projects supported by Analytical and Testing Center of Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China : 51902111 ; Dongguan Innovation Research Team Program : 2020607101007 ; Dongguan Postgraduate Joint Training (Practice) Workstation: 2019707102018; Guangdong HUST Industrial Technology Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Manufacturing Equipment Digitization: 2020B1212060014.","Chen, Jie, Significantly improved breakdown strength and energy density of tri-layered polymer nanocomposites with optimized graphene oxide, Composites Science and Technology, 186, (2020); Gong, Lei, An enhancement on the dielectric performance of poly(vinylidene fluoride)-based composite with graphene oxide-BaTiO3 hybrid, Nanocomposites, 5, 2, pp. 61-66, (2019); Yu, Yang, Enhanced energy storage efficiency in PVDF based composite films using MnO2 nano-fillers, Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, 31, 21, pp. 18336-18343, (2020); Sun, Qinzhao, Achieving high energy density and discharge efficiency in multi-layered PVDF-PMMA nanocomposites composed of 0D BaTiO3and 1D NaNbO3@SiO2, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, 8, 21, pp. 7211-7220, (2020); Wang, Zhuo, Enhanced energy storage property of plate-like Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15/poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites through texture arrangement, Ceramics International, 45, 15, pp. 18356-18362, (2019); Yang, Yan, Ni(OH)2 as an novel shell layer material for core-shell dielectric filler based on barium titanate and their dielectric polymer composites in P(VDF-HFP) matrix, Composites Science and Technology, 198, (2020); Prateek, Significantly Enhanced Energy Density by Tailoring the Interface in Hierarchically Structured TiO 2 -BaTiO 3 -TiO 2 Nanofillers in PVDF-Based Thin-Film Polymer Nanocomposites, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 11, 15, pp. 14329-14339, (2019); Marwat, Mohsin Ali, Significant Energy Density of Discharge and Charge-Discharge Efficiency in Ag@BNN Nanofillers-Modified Heterogeneous Sandwich Structure Nanocomposites, ACS Applied Energy Materials, 3, 7, pp. 6591-6601, (2020); Marwat, Mohsin Ali, Ultrahigh energy density and thermal stability in sandwich-structured nanocomposites with dopamine@Ag@BaTiO3, Energy Storage Materials, 31, pp. 492-504, (2020); Jiang, Jianyong, Synergy of micro-/mesoscopic interfaces in multilayered polymer nanocomposites induces ultrahigh energy density for capacitive energy storage, Nano Energy, 62, pp. 220-229, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123984754"

There are some unresolved issues with the properties of HOIPs, such as the relation between the configuration of methylammonium (MA) ions and their electronic and structural properties. For example, it was theoretically proposed that the change in the bandgap from direct to indirect and/or structural distortion can be caused by a change in the orientation of the MA ions with respect to the PbX3 cage in CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, or Cl). By using polarized Raman scattering spectroscopy, we experimentally show that the MA ions in CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals are parallelly oriented toward a special crystallographic direction in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase at least on our measurement scale of approximately square micrometers. Experimental measurement results verified by density functional theory calculations indicate the presence of a macroscopic domain consists of a parallel directional alignment of the MA ions, a strong signature of ferroelectricity in HOIPs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemical Stability; Density Functional Theory; Ions; Organic-inorganic Materials; Raman Scattering; Single Crystals; Temperature; Electronic And Structural Properties; Hybrid Organic-inorganic; Methylammonium Cations; Micro Raman Scattering Spectroscopy; Parallel Alignments; Polarized Micro-raman; Polarized Raman; Property; Raman Scattering Spectroscopy; Structural Distortions; Perovskite","Chemical stability; Density functional theory; Ions; organic-inorganic materials; Raman scattering; Single crystals; Temperature; Electronic and structural properties; Hybrid organic-inorganic; Methylammonium cations; Micro Raman scattering spectroscopy; Parallel alignments; Polarized micro-Raman; Polarized Raman; Property; Raman scattering spectroscopy; Structural distortions; Perovskite","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program (NRF-2016R1D1A1B01009032, NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025340 and 2022R1A2C1010497) through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).

The Si surface modified with different nanostructures including Si nanopyramids (SiNPs), Si nanoholes (SiNHs) and Si nanowires (SiNWs) was utilized to improve light trapping and photo-carrier collection. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.15% was obtained with the hybrid solar cell employing SiNWs, which is about 8%, 20% and 40% higher compared to the devices using SiNHs, SiNPs and planar Si, respectively. The enhancement is attributed to the low reflectance of the SiNW structures and large PEDOT:PSS/Si interfacial area. In addition, the influence of AuNPs on the hybrid solar cell's performance was examined. The PCE of the SiNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cell with 0.5 wt% AuNP is 8.89%, which is ca. 9% higher than that of the device without AuNPs (8.15%).

We studied 142 children aged 3 years from the 2012 Bien Hoa birth cohort in a hotspot of dioxin contamination in Vietnam. Children’s faces were viewed using the eye-tracking method. Associations between gaze behavior of faces and neurodevelopmental indices and head circumference were analyzed to determine whether poor gaze behavior indicates increased autistic traits in these children. The gaze fixation duration on facial areas when viewing 10 still images of children was calculated as the gaze behavior index. Autistic behavior was assessed using the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale, and language development was evaluated by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Ver. 3. The face fixation duration (%) significantly decreased as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) concentrations increased in a dose–effect manner in girls, which suggested atypical gaze behavior for watching human faces. Furthermore, these girls with atypical gaze behavior showed lower social communication scores and smaller head sizes, suggesting increased autistic traits in girls. In conclusion, our findings show sex-specific effects (girls > boys) of perinatal TCDD exposure on gaze behavior in young children. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autistic Trait; Dioxin; Gaze Behavior; Social Communication; Vietnam; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; 2,4,5 Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid; Tobii Studio Version 3.3.1; Tobii X2-60 Compact; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; 2,4,5 Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxin; Adult; Article; Autism; Autism Assessment; Autism Spectrum Rating Scale; Bayley Scales Of Infant Development; Breast Milk; Cephalometry; Child; Cohort Analysis; Communication Skill; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Eye Fixation; Eye-tracking Technology; Face; Female; Gaze; Head Circumference; Human; Infant; Language Development; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nervous System Development; Newborn; Perinatal Drug Exposure; Pollution; Preschool Child; Sex Difference; Social Interaction; Viet Nam","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; adult; Article; autism; autism assessment; Autism Spectrum Rating Scale; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; breast milk; cephalometry; child; cohort analysis; communication skill; concentration (parameter); controlled study; eye fixation; eye-tracking technology; face; female; gaze; head circumference; human; infant; language development; major clinical study; male; nervous system development; newborn; perinatal drug exposure; pollution; preschool child; sex difference; social interaction; Viet Nam","","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin, 1746-01-6; 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 39277-47-9, 93-76-5","Funding: This work was partly supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture with a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (25305024 and 17H04665).

IVD diseases develop on the basis of degeneration, and there are no established treatments for degeneration. IVD diseases may therefore represent a candidate for the application of regenerative medicine, potentially employing normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) induced to differentiate into nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Here, we used a three-dimensional culture system to demonstrate that ectopic expression of MYC, KLF4, NOTO, SOX5, SOX6, and SOX9 in NHDFs generated NP-like cells, detected using Safranin-O staining. Quantitative PCR, microarray analysis, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed that the induced NP cells exhibited a fully differentiated phenotype.

However, alkali-silica reaction (ASR) will be a serious problem when the recycled glass is used as concrete aggregates. This paper shows an investigation of the alkali-silica reaction of glass sand mortar under steam curing. The test for ASR expansion follows ASTM C1567. Type F fly ash (FA) is used together with Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mixing with mixed color glass sand. FA contents are of 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% as OPC replacement. Steam curing accelerating FA reaction is used to contribute to the mitigation of ASR by strength improvement of the mortar. Under steam curing, the results show that the recommended contents of FA to use are of 20% to 30% to ensure expansion lower than the threshold of ASTM. Moreover, steam curing increases the expansion of the glass sand mortar in compared to the moist curing, and expansion crack appears at the interface between glass sand and cementitious matrix, not in the glass sand. In comparison with glass sand mortar under moist curing, expansion of glass sand mortar using fly ash under steam curing is contributed primarily by: (1) delayed ettringite formation, (2) reducing ion transportation, (3) increasing tensile strength of fly ash glass sand mortar and (4) reducing glass sand dissolution rate in rich alkalinity solution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkali-silica Reaction; Fly Ash; Recycled Glass Aggregate; Steam Curing","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for supporting this research through the CRC 2016 project of the AUN/SEED-Net Program.

Both of these HEA systems are single-phase, face-centered-cubic (FCC) structures. Specifically, we examined the tensile response in as-cast quaternary CoCrFeNi and quinary CoCrFeMnNi HEAs at room temperature. Compared to CoCrFeNi HEA, the elongation of CoCrFeMnNi HEA was 14% lower, but the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were increased by 17% and 6%, respectively. The direct real-time evolution of structural defects during uniaxial straining was acquired via in situ neutron-diffraction measurements. The dominant microstructures underlying plastic deformation mechanisms at each deformation stage in as-cast CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs were revealed using the Convolutional Multiple Whole Profile (CMWP) software for peak-profile fitting.

Two different temperature glass values were obtained when the ratio of EDPNR in EDPNR/PMMA was less than 80 wt.%. The ionic conductivity of EDPNR could be improved by increasing the amount of lithium salt up to 35 wt.%, after this amount the ionic conductivity of EDPNR was significantly decreased. While in the ternary blends, the highest ionic conductivity value was found at the ratio 80/20 of EDPNR/PMMA.

The NF and calcined ferralsol at the selected temperature (CF500) were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, XRF and other experiments to elucidate changes in morphology and physicochemical properties. CF500 and coal slag (CS) were examined as wetland media individually and combinedly. The applicability of CF500 and CS as the hybrid media in the lab–scale horizontal sub–surface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF–CWs) was evaluated. It was found that 500 °C was the best calcination temperature of NF for P adsorption. The maximum P adsorption capacity of CF500 (19.4 mg/g) was 60.4 ± 2.2 % greater than that of NF. While isotherm data of P sorption by CF500 were fitted both Langmuir and Freundlich models, the kinetic data was better described by Pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters revealed the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the P sorption by CF500. The combination of CF500 and CS leveraged the merits of individual substrates while mitigated their demerits. The optimal mixing ratio of CF500 to CS was 1.25:1 by volume. The hybrid CF500–CS substrate HSSF–CWs demonstrated satisfactory P removal efficiency (99.44% ± 0.1) and effluent P concentration (0.08 ± 0.01 mg/L). Application of the mixed substrate in the HSSF–CWs resulted in negligible side effects on their effluent quality. Due to abundant availability of raw materials, simplicity of preparation, as well as efficiency and safety of application, a mixture of CF500 and CS is a promising hybrid substrate in HSSF–CWs for P–rich wastewater decontamination. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calcined Ferralsol; Coal Slag; Constructed Wetlands; Hybrid Substrate; Phosphorus Adsorption; P–rich Wastewater; Adsorption; Calcination; Coal; Efficiency; Effluent Treatment; Hybrid Materials; Morphology; Phosphorus; Physicochemical Properties; Slags; Substrates; Water Quality; Wetlands; Calcined Ferralsol; Coal Slag; Ferralsol; Ftir; Hybrid Substrates; Phosphorus Adsorption; Phosphorus Removal; P–rich Wastewater; Subsurface Flow; Surface Flow Constructed Wetlands; Effluents","Adsorption; Calcination; Coal; Efficiency; Effluent treatment; Hybrid materials; Morphology; Phosphorus; Physicochemical properties; Slags; Substrates; Water quality; Wetlands; Calcined ferralsol; Coal slag; Ferralsol; FTIR; Hybrid substrates; Phosphorus adsorption; Phosphorus removal; P–rich wastewater; Subsurface Flow; Surface flow constructed wetlands; Effluents","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 105.99-2018.13 .","Yin, Yue, Fabricationofceramsiteadsorbentfromindustrialwastesforthe removal of phosphorus from aqueous solutions, Journal of Chemistry, 2020, (2020); Zangarini, Sara, Phosphorus removal from livestock effluents: recent technologies and new perspectives on low-cost strategies, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 6, pp. 5730-5743, (2020); Ashrafi, Elham, Optimising nutrient removal of a hybrid five-stage Bardenpho and moving bed biofilm reactor process using response surface methodology, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 7, 1, (2019); Jaafari, Jalil, Performance of modified one-stage phoredox reactor with hydraulic up-flow in biological removal of phosphorus from municipal wastewater, Desalination and Water Treatment, 171, pp. 216-222, (2019); undefined, (2020); Lan, Wei, Phosphorus removal enhancement of magnesium modified constructed wetland microcosm and its mechanism study, Chemical Engineering Journal, 335, pp. 209-214, (2018); Gorgoglione, Angela, Sustainable management and successful application of constructed wetlands: A critical review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 11, (2018); Vymazal, Jan, Removal of nutrients in various types of constructed wetlands, Science of the Total Environment, 380, 1-3, pp. 48-65, (2007); Wu, Peng, Efficiency and mechanism of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in modified zeolite wetland, Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science, 38, 2, pp. 580-588, (2017); Wang, Hanxi, A review of research on substrate materials for constructed wetlands, Materials Science Forum, 913, pp. 917-929, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114175046"

Inadequate management and uncontrolled disposal may impact significantly to the health and environment. E-waste could become a significant source of precious metals at the end of e-waste life. The recovery of precious metals from e-waste provides a sustainable solution; however, conventional hydrometallurgical approach bears a greater fraction of environmental concerns and energy utilization. In this study, effort has been given to recover palladium (Pd(II)) from ceramic capacitor using solvent-ligand process with a focus on environmental sustainability. The use of 3–(((5–ethoxybenzenethiol)imino)methyl)–salicylic acid as a ligand to recover Pd(II) from ceramic capacitor was investigated. The effects of different variables such as, contact time and reaction temperature, leaching kinetics as well as the environmental assessment of synthesis process were examined. The high purity of Pd(II)was recovered from ceramic capacitor under optimized condition, as evident from XRD and XPS analysis. The formation of [Pd(II)-ligand]n+ complexes was attributed to the recovery of pure metallic Pd(II). The environmental assessment measured from Biwer and Heinzle Method (BHM) indicated that the solvent-legend approach for recovering Pd(II)is associated with the lower impact on the environment compared with the other process. The results open up a sustainable recovery of precious metals contributing to the circular economy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceramic Capacitor; E-waste; Palladium(ii) Separation And Recovery; Precious Metals; Solid-liquid Approach; Sustainability; Electronic Waste; Ligands; Metal Recovery; Palladium Compounds; Reaction Kinetics; Solvents; Sustainable Development; E-waste Generations; E-wastes; Environmental Assessment; Environmental Concerns; Health And Environment; Novel Ligands; Palladium(ii) Separation And Recovery; Solid-liquid Approach; Solid/liquid; Sustainable Solution; Energy Utilization; Ligand; Palladium; Solvent; Article; Contact Time; E-waste; Economic Aspect; Environmental Impact; Environmental Sustainability; Kinetics; Nonhuman; Reaction Temperature; Separation Technique; X Ray Diffraction; X Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy","Electronic Waste; Ligands; Metal recovery; Palladium compounds; Reaction kinetics; Solvents; Sustainable development; E-waste generations; E-wastes; Environmental assessment; Environmental concerns; Health and environment; Novel ligands; Palladium(II) separation and recovery; Solid-liquid approach; Solid/liquid; Sustainable solution; Energy utilization; ligand; palladium; solvent; Article; contact time; e-waste; economic aspect; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; kinetics; nonhuman; reaction temperature; separation technique; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy","","","Funding text 1: The work was supported by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT), division of Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Bangladesh under the grant no. 56.00.0000.028.33.097.18-206.

The technologies under study in this chapter are DHS (downflow hanging sponge) reactor and biochar applications because DHS is a simple, compact, low-cost system that achieves sufficiently high chemical oxygen demand and nutrient removal without aeration, and biochar is a promising material to be used as an adsorbent to remove hazardous organic pollutnats such as antibiotics. In addition, biochar is a suitable bio-carrier for biodegradation of cyanotoxins to provide safe potable water. DHS is already in the preparatory stage for practical use, so we mainly reviewed results of treatment experiments using domestic wastewater in a practical condition. On the other hand, the removal of antibiotics by biochar adsorption has been evaluated from various laboratory experiment results. We mainly reviewed the production of biochar and explained the fundamental characteristics of adsorption mechanisms in biochar because understating the mechanism is important to develop an appropriate treatment system. As a countermeasure to the cyanotoxin contamination problem in potable water obtained from eutrophicated lakes and reservoir, biochar can contribute to developing a cost-effective water supply system for rural areas in developing countries, because biochar can be used not only as an adsorbent of cyanotoxin, but also as a suitable habitat for microorganisms and microfauna as well to enhance the biodegradation of cyanotoxin and toxic cyanobacterial cells simultaneously. Finally, the use of biochar as a bio-fence system is explained as a remarkable idea to purify lake and reservoir water contaminated with cyanotoxin microcystins and toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis cells. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibiotics; Biochar; Biofence; Cyanotoxin; Dhs; Less Developed And Developing Countries; Low-cost","","","","","Ahmed, Mohammad Boshir, Single and competitive sorption properties and mechanism of functionalized biochar for removing sulfonamide antibiotics from water, Chemical Engineering Journal, 311, pp. 348-358, (2017); Aktaş, Özgür, Effect of activation type on bioregeneration of various activated carbons loaded with phenol, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 81, 7, pp. 1081-1092, (2006); Aller, Maria Fernanda, Biochar properties: Transport, fate, and impact, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 46, 14-15, pp. 1183-1296, (2016); Andersson, Monique I.

So far, the Anammox-based applications have focused on sidestream wastewater treatment (>80%), whereas its application in mainstream wastewater treatment is faced with many obstacles.

The findings are subsequently summarized to suggest potential improvements and future directions for research and development addressing the issue of microplastic pollution. The research identified that supportive policy measures coupled with effective WWTP designs are important for minimizing microplastic-related pollution. In addition, knowledge of the origins of microplastics is useful for WWT system designers, practitioners, policymakers, product designers, and other stakeholders. While sampling and analytical methods continue to evolve, several recommended best practices include focusing on the minimization of contamination, reproducibility, and the applicability of methods in WWTP facilities. Because microplastics can include complex composite polymers with additives, adsorbents, and biofilm, further research on toxicity, chemical leachability, and pathogenic biofilm properties is needed to understand the potential impact on biological wastewater treatment systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytical Methods; Combined Sewer; Down The Drain; Microplastic; Microplastics In Sludge; Sampling; Street Runoff; Wastewater Treatment","","","","","Abeynayaka, Amila, Rapid sampling of suspended and floating microplastics in challenging riverine and coastal water environments in Japan, Water (Switzerland), 12, 7, (2020); In Proceedings of the Annual Conference of SETAC Europe, (2021); Akhbarizadeh, Razegheh, Investigating microplastics bioaccumulation and biomagnification in seafood from the Persian Gulf: a threat to human health?, Food Additives and Contaminants - Part A, 36, 11, pp. 1696-1708, (2019); Alaerts, Luc, Impact of bio-based plastics on current recycling of plastics, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 5, (2018); Anderson, Julie C., Microplastics in aquatic environments: Implications for Canadian ecosystems, Environmental Pollution, 218, pp. 269-280, (2016); Atugoda, Thilakshani, Adsorptive interaction of antibiotic ciprofloxacin on polyethylene microplastics: Implications for vector transport in water, Environmental Technology and Innovation, 19, (2020); Bayo, Javier Alegre, Microplastics and microfibers in the sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant, International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning, 11, 5, pp. 812-821, (2016); Ben-David, Eric A., Microplastic distributions in a domestic wastewater treatment plant: Removal efficiency, seasonal variation and influence of sampling technique, Science of the Total Environment, 752, (2021); Nasruddin, Natural rubber composites for solid tyre used for forklift tensile properties and morphological characteristics, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1282, 1, (2019); Primary Microplastics in the Oceans A Global Evaluation of Sources, (2017)","","Elsevier","","","","","","","9780323999434; 9780323998741","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140739838"

Serotypes 1/2b were dominant, and internalin genes (inlA, inlC, and inlJ) were found in all the L. monocytogenes isolates. Most of the isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, oxacillin, and fosfomycin. Genotyping of L. monocytogenes by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed three clusters of the isolates specific to the facilities to some extent. This study suggests a high risk of L. monocytogenes contamination from wash water to fish.

Our simplified thermodynamic model is implemented for capturing the latent heat transfer of phase change. A density-based algorithm based on the explicit Harten-Yee second-order upwind TVD scheme is performed. The numerical result is compared with Abuaf’s experimental data, for which a quantitative agreement in the flow parameters is produced. Thermodynamic effect analysis shows that the temperature depression increases as the water temperature increases. That results in an obvious decrease of the local saturated vapor pressure at high-temperature conditions. The flashing non-equilibrium effect then reduces and is reasonably predicted by the homogeneous model. The thermodynamic suppression is obvious in the flow characterized by the cavitation mechanism rather than the flashing.

The control method is proposed based on Sugeno fuzzy logic. The flex sensor detects the bending of the fingers. The mobile robot works using the signal of the flex sensor on the right hand to stop, forward, backward, forward, left, and right. The experiment system consists of Arduino Uno microcontrollers, flex sensors, and a module Bluetooth HC-05. The flex sensor can vary values between normal conditions of 25 up to a maximum of 125. The lowest speed and the highest speed of the mobile robot are 0.55 m/s and 2.52 m/s. The rate of the robot depends on the bending of the fingers. It makes the robot movement is smoother. Module Bluetooth can send the data wirelessly with a maximum distance of 10 m without obstacles.

The study used the Direct Titration method (DTM) and Reverse Titration method (RTM) for determining the content of Al3+ and Fe3+ contained in sludge samples, which were taken from the silt tank of two feedwater treatment plants at Daklak province, Vietnam. The study carried out series of experiments in the laboratory to recycle coagulants solution (Fe<inf>2</inf>(SO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>3</inf>, Al<inf>2</inf>(SO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>3</inf>) at different conditions: the ratio of mixing (sludge: sulphuric acid), reaction time, reaction temperature. The results showed that two sludge samples contained content of Al3+ higher than Fe3+, the content of Al3+ and Fe3+ are 1.762 mg.g−1, 0.028 mg.g−1 for Buon Ho plant sample (BHS) and 1.748 mg.g−1, 0.036 mg.g−1 for Eachu-Cap plant sample (ECS), respectively.

The efficiency of preparing is quite high, reaching 90.73% for Al3+ and 88.89% for Fe3+, respectively. Performance of orthophosphate treatment has reached 98,74% at the optimal conditions: pH 6, the volume of coagulant is 2.5 mL/200 mL wastewater, stirring time is 25–30 min.

A control method is proposed to reduce the vibration on the top layer under earthquakes. The fuzzy sliding mode is combined with adaptive law to suppress the device’s top-layer vibration against earthquake excitation. The stability of the control method is guaranteed by Lyapunov theory.

As was pointed out in the 2020 edition of the World Water Development Report, climate change challenges the sustainability of global water resources, so it is important to monitor the quality of water to preserve sustainable water resources. Quality of water can be related to the structure of water crystal, the solid-state of water, so methods to understand water crystals can help to improve water quality. As a first step, a water crystal exploratory analysis has been initiated with the cooperation with the Emoto Peace Project (EPP). The 5K EPP dataset has been created as the first world-wide small dataset of water crystals. Our research focused on reducing the inherent limitations when fitting machine learning models to the 5K EPP dataset. One major result is the classification of water crystals and how to split our small dataset into several related groups. Using the 5K EPP dataset of human observations and past research on snow crystal classification, we created a simple set of visual labels to identify water crystal shapes, in 13 categories. A deep learning-based method has been used to automatically do the classification task with a subset of the label dataset. The classification achieved high accuracy when using a fine-tuning technique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Deep Learning; Fine-tuning; Supervised; Water Crystal","","","","Funding: This work was supported by the National Institute of Informatics (NII) under the GLO Internship program and Emoto Peace Project, Non-profit Organization.","Boyd, Claude Elson, Water quality: An introduction, pp. 1-357, (2015); Fourth Phase of Water Beyond Solid Liquid and Vapor, (2013); Snow Crystals Natural and Artificial, (1954); J Fac Sci, (1966); Kikuchi, Katsuhiko, A global classification of snow crystals, ice crystals, and solid precipitation based on observations from middle latitudes to polar regions, Atmospheric Research, 132-133, pp. 460-472, (2013); Hicks, Adam C., Method for classification of snowflakes based on images by a multi-angle snowflake camera using convolutional neural networks, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 36, 12, pp. 2267-2282, (2019); Ziletti, Angelo, Insightful classification of crystal structures using deep learning, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Radin, Dean I., Double-Blind Test of the Effects of Distant Intention on Water Crystal Formation, Explore, 2, 5, pp. 408-411, (2006); Radin, Dean I., Effects of distant intention on water crystal formation: A triple-blind replication, Journal of Scientific Exploration, 22, 4, pp. 481-493, (2008); Feng, S., Using deep neural network with small dataset to predict material defects, Materials and Design, 162, pp. 300-310, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122922937"

However, the nonlinear optical properties of the fluoride hosts in this wavelength region have not been investigated yet, although nonlinearity could result in undesirable effects such as self-focusing and pulse distortion when these fluoride materials are used as gain media in high-power, ultrashort pulse laser oscillator and amplifier systems. In this work, the nonlinear refractive index of lithium calcium aluminum fluoride (LiCaAlF<inf>6</inf>), lithium strontium aluminum fluoride (LiSrAlF<inf>6</inf>), lanthanum fluoride (LaF<inf>3</inf>), and yttrium lithium fluoride (YLiF<inf>4</inf>) fluoride host materials are determined using the Kramers–Krönig relation model in the ultraviolet wavelength region. Self-focusing conditions, particularly at the peak laser emission wavelength of these materials, are further analyzed.

Novelty impact statement: In order to maintain the quality of fish products during storage, many preservation methods and techniques are commonly used, where the use of chemicals can directly affect human health. The use of natural preservatives is a promising method that could be an alternative to synthetic additives.

In order to explode this behavior, four-dimensional material flow was discussed based on an innovative X-ray imaging technology approach. As a result of the advanced experimental measurement, two fluid vortexes (a vortex pair) are found in the melted domain. The relative contour of each vortex is enormously altered when the keyhole boundary changes due to the orifice diameter variation. These relative profiles of each vortex are dependent to decisively govern the mass transfer and convection flow in the melted domain. Steeper keyhole parapet was formed by a strong plasma jet, accelerated through the narrow orifice diameter (2.0 mm), resulting in a large downward shear force component inside the keyhole to produce a larger vortex at the lower part of the weld pool. On the other hand, due to a wider diameter of orifice (2.4 mm), the plasma arc column is expanded. Rear kerf of the keyhole is more inclined toward the ending part of the weld pool. This caused a stronger shear force component along the keyhole surface at the top side of the weld pool in the outward direction. As a result, the vortex at the top side of the weld pool is much bigger and longer in comparison with diameter 2.0 mm.

The ultrasonic horns vibrating at 20 kHz in both cases of half wave length and full wave length are designed by finite element method. Aluminum 7075 alloy is used for fabricating the ultrasonic horn. The injection mold of miniature parts was designed and manufactured for producing the tensile samples with PA6. Heater is also inserted in the injection mold for controlling the temperature of the injection mold. As a result, the miniature products are successfully obtained by ultrasonic injection molding. The major parameters of pressure, ultrasonic applying time, holding time and mold temperature are utilized at 0.2 MPa, 2 s, 5 s, 60 °C, respectively. Some ultrasonic molding process parameters and its interactive parameters such as pressure, ultrasonic applying time, holding time and molding temperature were also investigated.

Bio-sponge and bio-cloth reactors showed removal of COD (79 vs. 76%) and NH<inf>4</inf>+–N (78 vs. 73%). While bio-cord treatment was deteriorated due to time-dependent process. Multiple linear regression revealed that alkalinity governed the formation degree of the anaerobic zone in bio-sponges, partially affecting nitrification. Increasing IR from 1 to 3 caused sloughing of the attached biomass and was positively correlated with effluent nitrite nitrogen concentration, indicating the sensitivity of nitrification to spatial distribution effects.

The neo-Hookean model is used for hyperelastic material and the nonlinear elastic behavior of 2D bodies are simulated under finite deformation state with total Lagrange formulation. In the approximation of field nodes, the present iRBF shape functions are constructed through integration. With the property of damping out or at least containing an inherent inaccuracy, the iRBF produces a greatly improved approximation of its derivatives. Moreover, the meshfree numerical approach shows its advantage to analyze large deformation problems by the feature of “free of mesh”, especially it does not suffer from the volumetric locking. A number of numerical examples are given to compare the results of the proposed method with the reference solutions given by other methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hyperelasticity; Integrated Radial Basis Function; Meshfree Method; Deformation; Elasticity; Functions; Image Segmentation; Incompressible Flow; Integration; Locks (fasteners); Mesh Generation; Numerical Methods; Deformation State; Finite Deformations; Hyper Elastic; Hyper-elasticity; Hyperelastic Materials; Integrated Radial Basis Functions; Meshfree Methods; Nearly Incompressible; Neo-hookean Model; Non-linear Elastic Behavior; Radial Basis Function Networks","Deformation; Elasticity; Functions; Image segmentation; Incompressible flow; Integration; Locks (fasteners); Mesh generation; Numerical methods; Deformation state; Finite deformations; Hyper elastic; Hyper-elasticity; Hyperelastic materials; Integrated radial basis functions; Meshfree methods; Nearly incompressible; Neo-Hookean model; Non-linear elastic behavior; Radial basis function networks","","","Acknowledgment.

In female cells, X chromosome reactivation (XCR) is closely linked to the acquisition of naïve iPSCs. To visualize the status of X chromosome in living cells and further analyze XCR mechanism, we established a novel noninvasive detection system of XCR. Here we established female mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines whose allele of both X chromosomes carry each of different fluorescent protein genes [Kusabira Orange (KO) and Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)]. These mESC clones, initially displaying yellow fluorescence owing to two active X chromosomes, generate chimeric cluster of cells showing either orange or green fluorescence (KO+ or EGFP+), indicating that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurs in these mESC clones during differentiation. When the single colored cells were reprogrammed, the iPS colonies displayed yellow (KO+/EGFP+) fluorescence, indicating XCR upon reprogramming. Our work reveals generated female KO+/EGFP+ mESC lines can be used for monitoring X chromosome status during differentiation and/or reprogramming. This novel system is also potential for tracking acquisition of pluripotency of iPSCs during reprogramming and screening for factors or culture conditions which promote this event. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ipsc; Xci; Xcr; Xist; Biomedical Engineering; Citrus Fruits; Cloning; Cytology; Diagnosis; Fluorescence; Genes; Proteins; Culture Conditions; Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein; Fluorescent Protein; Green Fluorescence; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells; Non-invasive Detection; X-chromosome Inactivation; Stem Cells","Biomedical engineering; Citrus fruits; Cloning; Cytology; Diagnosis; Fluorescence; Genes; Proteins; Culture conditions; Enhanced green fluorescent protein; Fluorescent protein; Green fluorescence; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Mouse embryonic stem cells; Non-invasive detection; X-chromosome inactivation; Stem cells","","","","Takahashi, Kazutoshi, Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors, Cell, 126, 4, pp. 663-676, (2006); Singh, Vimal Kishor, Induced pluripotent stem cells: Applications in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 3, FEB, (2015); Polo, Jose Maria, A molecular roadmap of reprogramming somatic cells into iPS cells, Cell, 151, 7, pp. 1617-1632, (2012); Boland, Michael J., Adult mice generated from induced pluripotent stem cells, Nature, 461, 7260, pp. 91-94, (2009); Carey, Bryce W., Reprogramming factor stoichiometry influences the epigenetic state and biological properties of induced pluripotent stem cells, Cell Stem Cell, 9, 6, pp. 588-598, (2011); Di, Keqian, Generation of fully pluripotent female murine-induced pluripotent stem cells, Biology of Reproduction, 92, 5, (2015); Kang, Lan, iPS Cells Can Support Full-Term Development of Tetraploid Blastocyst-Complemented Embryos, Cell Stem Cell, 5, 2, pp. 135-138, (2009); Okita, Keisuke, Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells, Nature, 448, 7151, pp. 313-317, (2007); Tong, Man, Mice generated from tetraploid complementation competent iPS cells show similar developmental features as those from ES cells but are prone to tumorigenesis, Cell Research, 21, 11, pp. 1634-1637, (2011); Wernig, Marius, In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state, Nature, 448, 7151, pp. 318-324, (2007)","Van Toi, V.; Nguyen, T.-H.; Long, V.B.; Huong, H.T.T.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","8th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering, BME8 2020","","Ho Chi Minh","264519","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115054018"

Here, the protection effects of AA against free radicals (mainly hydroxyl radicals) caused by low and high linear energy transfer radiation were examined. In this study, cobalt-60 gamma rays and helium ion beams were used as the sources of ionizing radiation. DNA strand breaks of PUC118 plasmid in the presence and absence of AA were monitored using agarose gel electrophoresis. Moreover, the survival rates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells irradiated with different AA concentrations in growing medium were analysed using the linear quadratic survival model. Based on the results of DNA strand break experiments, the yield of strand breaks increased with an increase in absorbed dose. In the presence of AA, the yield of strand breaks decreased with an increase in AA concentration. In other words, the greater the additive concentration, the more effective the radiation-protective agent. On the other hand, in the survival rate experiments, the dependence on additive concentration was not similar to that of the DNA experiments. We consider that the main reason for our observations is the difference in additive concentration between the outside and inside of the cell membrane of yeast cells. These results suggest that AA plays an effective role as a radiation-protective agent for DNA and living cells against free radicals formed by radiation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ascorbic Acid; Cell Survival; Dna Strand Breaks; Free Radical; Radiation Protection; Additives; Biomedical Engineering; Cells; Cytology; Dna; Electrophoresis; Energy Transfer; Free Radicals; Gamma Rays; Ion Beams; Radiation Effects; Radiation Shielding; Yeast; Additive Concentrations; Agarose Gel Electrophoresis; High Linear Energy Transfers; Hydroxyl Radicals; Protection Effect; Protective Agents; Radical Scavengers; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Yeast; Ascorbic Acid","Additives; Biomedical engineering; Cells; Cytology; DNA; Electrophoresis; Energy transfer; Free radicals; Gamma rays; Ion beams; Radiation effects; Radiation shielding; Yeast; Additive concentrations; Agarose gel electrophoresis; High linear energy transfers; Hydroxyl radicals; Protection effect; Protective agents; Radical scavengers; Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast; Ascorbic acid","","","The authors would like to thank the institute of Scientific and Industrial Research of Osaka University and the facilities of Radioisotope Research Center at the Suita campus of Osaka University.","Diagnostic Radiology Physics A Handbook for Teachers and Students, (2014); Nimse, Satish Balasaheb, Free radicals, natural antioxidants, and their reaction mechanisms, RSC Advances, 5, 35, pp. 27986-28006, (2015); Saitoh D, (2010); Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy Jcit, (2011); Bindhumol, V., Bisphenol A induces reactive oxygen species generation in the liver of male rats, Toxicology, 188, 2-3, pp. 117-124, (2003); undefined; undefined; Cai, Lu, Roles of vitamin C in radiation-induced DNA damage in presence and absence of copper, Chemico-Biological Interactions, 137, 1, pp. 75-88, (2001); Smith, Tyler Andrew, Radioprotective agents to prevent cellular damage due to ionizing radiation, Journal of Translational Medicine, 15, 1, (2017); Food Chem Toxicol, (2020)","Van Toi, V.; Nguyen, T.-H.; Long, V.B.; Huong, H.T.T.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","8th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering, BME8 2020","","Ho Chi Minh","264519","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115048626"

Two exposure markers were used: blood dioxin levels, as a marker of exposure in adulthood, and perinatal dioxin exposure, estimated by maternal residency in a dioxin-contaminated area during pregnancy. All subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We analyzed correlations between regional gray matter volumes and blood dioxin levels, and compared regional volumes between men with and without perinatal dioxin exposure using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) tool from Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12). Blood 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was associated with low volume of the medial temporal pole and fusiform gyrus. Toxic equivalency (TEQ)-PCDDs were correlated with low medial temporal pole volume. However, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD was associated with high middle frontal gyrus and cerebellum volume. In men with perinatal dioxin exposure, the left inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis volume was significantly lower than in those without perinatal exposure. These results suggest that dioxin exposure during the perinatal period and in adulthood may alter regional brain volume, which might lead to cognitive deficits and unusual social emotional behavior in Vietnamese men living in dioxin-contaminated areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adults; Brain Regional Volume; Dioxin; Neuro Imaging Analysis; Vietnam; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Magnetom Trio Tim; Matlab; Spm12; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Dioxin; Herbicide; Pesticide; Polychlorinated Biphenyl; Polychlorinated Dibenzofuran; Adult; Alcohol Consumption; Article; Blood Analysis; Body Mass; Brain Region; Brain Size; Breast Milk; Cerebellum; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Clinical Article; Cognition; Cognitive Defect; Controlled Study; Data Analysis Software; Fusiform Gyrus; Gardening; Gray Matter; Gray Matter Volume; Human; Inferior Frontal Gyrus; Limit Of Detection; Male; Middle Frontal Gyrus; Neuroimaging; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pars Orbitalis; Perinatal Exposure; Pesticide Spraying; Temporal Cortex; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Voxel Based Morphometry; White Matter","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; dioxin; herbicide; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; blood analysis; body mass; brain region; brain size; breast milk; cerebellum; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; data analysis software; fusiform gyrus; gardening; gray matter; gray matter volume; human; inferior frontal gyrus; limit of detection; male; middle frontal gyrus; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pars orbitalis; perinatal exposure; pesticide spraying; temporal cortex; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; voxel based morphometry; white matter","","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin, 1746-01-6","This work was supported partly by the Ministry of Education, Sports, Science and Culture, Japan, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (17H04665 and 18K19709).

The hydrolysis of melamine produces cyanuric acid during the hydrothermal treatment, and then the layered melamine-cyanuric acid complex serves as the supramolecular unit to form the 1D hexagonal-shaped BPCN after thermal polymerization at 500 °C for 4 h. The B and P heteroatoms can be doped inside the CN framework to form P-N and B-C bonds, resulting in the decrease in electric resistance to accelerate the electron transfer as well as the reduction of hole-electron recombination rate to enhance the photocatalytic activity of BPCN. Addition of 3 mL of phosphoric acid significantly enhances the visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activity of 1D BPCN toward DCF degradation. The photodegradation efficiency and rate of DCF over BPCN is a function of initial DCF concentration, pH and anions. Moreover, the BPCN exhibits an excellent reusability which can be effectively photodegrade DCF for at least 5 consecutive cycles. The reactive species of h+ and O<inf>2</inf>−• play an crucial role in the enhanced photodegradation of DCF, and, therefore, the plausible reaction mechanism and pathway for DCF photodegradation over 1D BPCN are proposed. These results clearly demonstrate that the BPCN is a superior visible-light-driven photocatalyst, and can pave a gateway to develop metal-free 1D nanocatalysts for the photodecomposition of emerging pollutants in water and wastewater. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boron; Diclofenac; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Phosphorous; Supramolecular Self-assembly; Visible-light-driven Photodegradation; Boron; Carbon Nitride; Light; Phosphorus; Photodegradation; Polymerization; Reusability; Self Assembly; Supramolecular Chemistry; Water Pollution; Co-doped; Diclofenac; Graphitic Carbon Nitrides; One-dimensional; Phosphorous; Photo Degradation; Supramolecular Self-assemblies; Thermal Polymerizations; Visible-light-driven; Visible-light-driven Photodegradation; Photocatalytic Activity","Boron; Carbon nitride; Light; Phosphorus; Photodegradation; Polymerization; Reusability; Self assembly; Supramolecular chemistry; Water pollution; Co-doped; Diclofenac; Graphitic carbon nitrides; One-dimensional; Phosphorous; Photo degradation; Supramolecular self-assemblies; Thermal polymerizations; Visible-light-driven; Visible-light-driven photodegradation; Photocatalytic activity","","","The authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan for financial support under grant Nos MOST 107–2221–E–007–113–MY3 and 110-2221-E-007-058-MY3.","Lamba, Manisha, Performance comparison of secondary and tertiary treatment systems for treating antibiotic resistance, Water Research, 127, pp. 172-182, (2017); Evgenidou, Eleni Ν., Occurrence and removal of transformation products of PPCPs and illicit drugs in wastewaters: A review, Science of the Total Environment, 505, pp. 905-926, (2015); Lonappan, Linson, Diclofenac and its transformation products: Environmental occurrence and toxicity - A review, Environment International, 96, pp. 127-138, (2016); Sathishkumar, Palanivel, Occurrence, interactive effects and ecological risk of diclofenac in environmental compartments and biota - a review, Science of the Total Environment, 698, (2020); Nguyen, Thanh Binh, Activation of persulfate by CoO nanoparticles loaded on 3D mesoporous carbon nitride (CoO@meso-CN) for the degradation of methylene blue (MB), Science of the Total Environment, 675, pp. 531-541, (2019); Nguyen, Thanh Binh, Enhanced catalytic reduction of nitrophenols by sodium borohydride over highly recyclable Au@graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposites, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 240, pp. 337-347, (2019); Ofrydopoulou, Anna, Exploring the phototransformation and assessing the in vitro and in silico toxicity of a mixture of pharmaceuticals susceptible to photolysis, Science of the Total Environment, 756, (2021); Bai, Xiaojuan, Surface defective g-C3N4−xClx with unique spongy structure by polarization effect for enhanced photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 398, (2020); Vesali-Kermani, Elham, Visible-light-induced nitrogen photofixation ability of g-C3N4 nanosheets decorated with MgO nanoparticles, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 84, pp. 185-195, (2020); Vesali-Kermani, Elham, Nitrogen photofixation ability of g-C3N4 nanosheets/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction photocatalyst under visible-light illumination, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 563, pp. 81-91, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120825489"

Herein, lignin depolymerization was investigated over Ni<inf>2</inf>P catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped activated carbon (Ni<inf>2</inf>P/AC_N). The catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness co-impregnation method followed by reduction with H<inf>2</inf> gas. The presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups on the activated carbon surface resulted in the dispersion of Ni<inf>2</inf>P particles. The good distribution and small crystal size of Ni<inf>2</inf>P significantly increased the active surface area, which enhanced both the catalytic activity and phenol selectivity. Investigations of the catalytic activity at different reaction temperatures and lignin-to-catalyst ratios using pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that the highest phenol selectivity of 80% was achieved using the Ni<inf>2</inf>P/AC_N25% catalyst. The proposed reaction mechanism involves lignin depolymerization via C–O and C–C cleavage with subsequent phenol formation by demethoxylation.

Secondary pollution is produced as a result of chemical-based element extraction. Thus, an eco-friendly approach to extracting elements from various ores is an urgent requirement. Hence, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the biomining potential of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (pre isolated) and their enzyme involved in the elements solubilization process using the biomining concept. According to the findings, the previously identified A. thiooxidans from bauxite mine tailings have reasonable biomining competence and produced sulfur as a core element and iron as a byproduct from powder for pyrite ore. Under optimal biomining reaction conditions (culture density 5 × 105, pH 4, 30 °C, and 80 h) the A. thiooxidans produced the 8.7 and 4.2 mg mL−1 of sulfur and iron from pyrite ore, respectively. Furthermore, the enzyme responsible for this biomining potential in A. thiooxidans was extracted and identified as sulfur dioxygenase (SDO) with a molecular weight of about 26 kDa using SDS PAGE analysis. Through the oxidation process, the extracted SDO leached the sulfur and produced 4. 9 mg of sulfite after 30 min of biomining. These findings suggested that A. thiooxidans and their intracellular enzyme SDO enzyme could be useful for using in the biomining process on pyrite ore as an environmentally friendly approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acidithiobacillus Thiooxidans; Biomining; Pyrite Ore; Sulfite; Sulfur Dioxygenase; Enzymes; Iron; Pyrites; Tailings; Acidithiobacillus Thiooxidans; Biomining; Dioxygenase Enzymes; Dioxygenases; Eco-friendly; Element Extraction; Pyrite Ores; Secondary Pollution; Sulphites; Sulphur Dioxygenase; Sulfur","Enzymes; Iron; Pyrites; Tailings; Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans; Biomining; Dioxygenase enzymes; Dioxygenases; Eco-friendly; Element extraction; Pyrite ores; Secondary pollution; Sulphites; Sulphur dioxygenase; Sulfur","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the DST-FIST (SR/FIST/LSI-673/2016) for helping to improve the instrumentation at Periyar University's Biotechnology Department in Salem, Tamil Nadu.

Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were the initial materials used for fabricating the filaments. The MWCNTs were dispersed in ABS resin, then extruded through a single-shaft extruder in filament form, with MWCNT contents of 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 3% or 4% by weight. After extrusion, the diameter of the filaments was about 1.75 mm, making them appropriate for FDM.

The six-compartment reactor, with a total effective volume of 3.2 L, was run continuously for 350 days at 30 °C. Overall, 66 ± 11% of ammonia was removed at a nitrogen loading rate of 0.083 ± 0.011 kg-N·m−3·day−1. In addition, long-term, stable partial nitrification was confirmed with nitrite concentration of 60 ± 26 mg-N·L−1 in effluent. On days 200 and 350, due to inhibition from the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) activity, the dissolved oxygen and the free ammonia concentration was recorded as low as 0.3–0.7 mg·L−1 and 14–24 mg-N·L−1 in each column, respectively. The special configuration of the photo-baffled reactor created a competitive environment between Chlorella vulgaris and nitrifying bacteria. The microbial community structure of the retained sludge indicated that although detected at only 2–3% upstream, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea increased downstream of the reactor. Meanwhile, the detection rate of NOB was less than 0.05% in each column and based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, NOB growth was inhibited. Therefore, these microalgae-nitrifying bacteria consortia have the potential to be a novel partial nitrification process for post-treatment using the anammox process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ammonia Removal; Microalgae-nitrifying Bacteria Consortia; Partial Nitrification; Algae; Bacteria; Dissolved Oxygen; Effluents; Nitrification; Nitrogen Removal; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Wastewater Treatment; Ammonia Removal; Baffled Reactors; Effective Volume; Micro-algae; Microalga-nitrifying Bacteria Consortium; Nitrifying Bacteria; Nitrite-oxidizing Bacteria; Nitrogen Loading; Partial Nitrification; Performance; Ammonia","Algae; Bacteria; Dissolved oxygen; Effluents; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Polymerase chain reaction; Wastewater treatment; Ammonia removal; Baffled reactors; Effective volume; Micro-algae; Microalga-nitrifying bacteria consortium; Nitrifying bacteria; Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria; Nitrogen loading; Partial nitrification; Performance; Ammonia","","","This research was supported by Nagaoka University of Technology , Japan (NUT) Presidential Research Grant and Prof. Yoshio Nosaka Research Grant Fund.

A novel photothermal material for the SSG system was fabricated by immersing bacterial cellulose (BC) sequentially into tannic acid (TA) and iron(iii) (Fe3+) solutions. Surface analysis of the resulting BC-TA-Fe3+ (BTF) material showed that coordination nanocomplexes between Fe3+ and hydroxyl groups of TA were formed on the surface of cellulose nanofibers. BTF material exhibited high sunlight absorption (∼95%), hydrophilic, self-cleaning properties, and excellent structural stability. SSG systems based on BTF had an evaporation efficiency of 91% and an evaporation rate of 1.56 kg m-2 h-1 under 1 sun illumination. Then, an efficient desalination device based on the larger-scale BTF material was fabricated to produce freshwater, the amount of freshwater per day was 5.6 kg m-2 on a sunny day. BTF material, thus, showed great potential in seawater desalination applications along with simple, versatile, scalable, and affordable fabrication methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellulose; Desalination; Evaporation; Flavonoids; Iron Compounds; Stability; Surface Analysis; Water; Bacterial Cellulose; Cellulose Composites; Fresh Water; Green Technology; Pure Water; Solar Steam; Steam Generation System; Tannic Acid; Vapor Generation; Water Scarcity; Tannins; Deionization; Iron Compounds","Cellulose; Desalination; Evaporation; Flavonoids; Iron compounds; Stability; Surface analysis; Water; Bacterial cellulose; Cellulose composites; Fresh Water; Green technology; Pure water; Solar steam; Steam generation system; Tannic acid; Vapor generation; Water scarcity; Tannins; Deionization; Iron Compounds","","","","Mekonnen, Mesfin M., Sustainability: Four billion people facing severe water scarcity, Science Advances, 2, 2, (2016); Min, Xinzhe, Interfacial Solar Vapor Generation: Materials and Structural Design, Accounts of Materials Research, 2, 4, pp. 198-209, (2021); Adv Sustainable Syst, (2021); Tang, Jiebin, Realization of Low Latent Heat of a Solar Evaporator via Regulating the Water State in Wood Channels, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 12, 16, pp. 18504-18511, (2020); Huang, Zhongming, A broadband aggregation-independent plasmonic absorber for highly efficient solar steam generation, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 8, 21, pp. 10742-10746, (2020); Sheng, Chengmin, Bamboo decorated with plasmonic nanoparticles for efficient solar steam generation, Applied Thermal Engineering, 167, (2020); Wu, Xuan, A flexible photothermal cotton-CuS nanocage-agarose aerogel towards portable solar steam generation, Nano Energy, 56, pp. 708-715, (2019); Ibrahim, Idris, Semiconductor photothermal materials enabling efficient solar steam generation toward desalination and wastewater treatment, Desalination, 500, (2021); He, Jingxian, High-Performance Salt-Rejecting and Cost-Effective Superhydrophilic Porous Monolithic Polymer Foam for Solar Steam Generation, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 12, 14, pp. 16308-16318, (2020); Liu, Fang, Superwetting monolithic hypercrosslinked polymers nanotubes with high salt-resistance for efficient solar steam generation, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 221, (2021)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20462069","","RSCAC","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119873065"

Recently, characterized by the surgery-first approach, an integrated orthodontic–surgical treatment has been introduced as an emerging solution to dentofacial deformity treatment. The surgery-first approach is regarded to have less treatment time and quicker enhancement of a facial profile than the conventional orthodontic– surgical treatment. Moreover, the recent advances in computing and imaging have allowed the adoption of 3-dimensional (3D) virtual planning protocols in orthognathic surgery as well as digital orthodontic treatment, which enables a paradigm shift when realizing virtual planning properly. These techniques then allow the surgeon and orthodontist to collaborate, plan, and simulate the dentofacial deformity treatment before performing the whole procedure. Along this line, in this research article, we present an integrated treatment method for the realization of an effective deformity treatment. Specifically, we implemented the integrated 3D technique by combining it with the surgery-first orthognathic approach (SFOA) as a novel treatment method for the patients. The outcomes from the combined treatments of the patients with dentofacial deformity, in practice, have demonstrated that our proposed 3D technique in orthognathics and orthodontics using clear aligner therapy (e.g., Invisalign) can enhance the satisfactory level of the patient since the start of treatment then improve their quality of life. As a result, the combined techniques realize the novel integrated treatment method using 3D technology with the use of 3D imaging and modeling as a promising development trend of dentistry, which fits into the context of Dentistry 4.0 as a key enabler to the concept of sustainable dentistry development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Deformity Treatment; Clear Aligner; Dentofacial Deformity; Digital Orthodontic; Surgery-first Orthognathic Approach (sfoa)","","","","Funding: The authors would like to thank Hanoi Medical University and Chulalongkorn University for supporting and funding us in conducting this research.","Grubb, John E., Orthodontic Management of Dentofacial Skeletal Deformities, Clinics in Plastic Surgery, 34, 3, pp. 403-415, (2007); Luther, Friederike, Orthodontic preparation for orthognathic surgery: How long does it take and why?

However, a relatively wide joint is needed, and considerable time and effort are consumed to construct the joint due to the addition of transverse reinforcements to the joint on site. These disadvantages affect the progress of on-site construction and should be addressed, especially when this method is applied to highway bridges, where early traffic opening is necessary in many cases. This study proposes a narrow loop joint that has fiber-reinforced mortar without transverse reinforcements. Several material tests were conducted to determine a suitable material for the joint. A series of flexural loading tests of slabs was conducted to investigate the flexural behavior of the proposed loop joint with the selected material (polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers). The results showed that the flexural capacity and deformation performance of the proposed joint with PVA fibers are equivalent to those of the conventional loop joint. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fiber-reinforced Mortar; Flexural Loading Test; Loop Joint; Polyvinyl Alcohol Fiber; Precast Concrete Slab","","","","","Fathalla, Eissa, Quantitative deterioration assessment of road bridge decks based on site inspected cracks, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 8, 7, (2018); Sakai, Hideaki, Study on renewal method from deteriorative RC slab to precast PC slab in the steel girder bridge, pp. 2169-2176, (2017); Advancements in Geotechnical Engineering, (2017); Ma, Haiying, Long-term behaviour of precast concrete deck using longitudinal prestressed tendons in composite i-girder bridges, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 8, 12, (2018); Expressway Standard Technical Specifications by Nexco Outline of Bridge Specifications, (2017); Ong, Khim Chye Gary, A strut-and-tie model for ultimate loads of precast concrete joints with loop connections in tension, Construction and Building Materials, 20, 3, pp. 169-176, (2006); Ong, Khim Chye Gary, Flexural behavior of precast joints with horizontal loop connections, ACI Structural Journal, 103, 5, pp. 664-671, (2006); Joergensen, Henrik B., Tests and limit analysis of loop connections between precast concrete elements loaded in tension, Engineering Structures, 52, pp. 558-569, (2013); Structural Connections for Precast Concrete Buildings, (2008); Concrete Reinforced and Prestressed Concrete Structures Part 1 Design and Construction, (2008)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114513768"

PMAPTAC was successfully synthesized and characterized by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) methods. PMAPTAC characteristics were found to be M<inf>n</inf> = 1.61 × 105, M<inf>w</inf> = 2.16 × 106, M<inf>w</inf>/M<inf>n</inf> = 13.4. Beta-lactam cefixime (CEF) removal was dramatically enhanced after polymer coating by pre-adsorption of PMAPTAC on nano-SiO<inf>2</inf>. The new adsorbent was dubbed PMAPTAC coated nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> (PCNS). Required time for adsorption, PCNS dosage, pH, and KCl concentration were thoroughly optimized for CEF removal and achieved at 120 min, 10 mg/mL, 4, and 1 mM, respectively. A two-step model can be used to fit the PMAPTAC on nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> and CEF on PCNS isotherms at different ionic strengths. Adsorption kinetics of CEF on PCNS appears to be pseudo-second-order. CEF removal using PCNS reached 89%, saturating at 10.9 mg/g. The driving force for CEF adsorption on PCNS was primarily Coulombic interaction of negative CEF species and positive surface charge of PCNS. After three reuses, CEF elimination was still greater than 85%. The influence of some organics on CEF treatment using PCNS was insignificant while CEF removal from a real hospital wastewater sample was greater than 70%. Our study indicates that a hybrid and new adsorbent based on nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> rice husk with pre-adsorption with PMAPTAC is useful for antibiotic removal from wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Cefixime; Coating, Nanosilica; Pmaptac; Chlorine Compounds; Gel Permeation Chromatography; Ionic Strength; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Plastic Coatings; Potassium Compounds; Silica; Wastewater Treatment; Adsorptive Removal; Cefixime; Coating, Nanosilicum; Nano Silica; Nano-sio$-2$; Poly(3-methacryloylamino Propyl-trimethylammonium Chloride); Polycations; Pre-adsorption; Rice Husk; Synthesised; Adsorption","Chlorine compounds; Gel permeation chromatography; Ionic strength; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Plastic coatings; Potassium compounds; Silica; Wastewater treatment; Adsorptive removal; Cefixime; Coating, nanosilicum; Nano Silica; Nano-SiO$-2$; Poly(3-methacryloylamino propyl-trimethylammonium chloride); Polycations; Pre-adsorption; Rice husk; Synthesised; Adsorption","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under project number QG.20.22 .

Bioremediation has been proven to be an effective, economical, and eco-friendly technique to remove heavy metals from various wastewaters. The newly developed algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has emerged as a promising biosorbent for treating wastewater containing heavy metals, especially Cr(VI). In this study, two identical cylindrical sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), i.e., R1 (Control) and R2 (with 1% additional salinity), were used to cultivate algal-bacterial AGS and then to evaluate the effect of salinity on the performance of the two SBRs. The results reflected that less filamentation and a rougher surface could be observed on algal-bacterial AGS when exposed to 1% salinity, which showed little influence on organics removal. However, the removals of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and total phosphorus (TP) were noticeably impacted at the 1% salinity condition, and were further decreased with the co-existence of 2 mg/L Cr(VI). The Cr(VI) removal efficiency, on the other hand, was 31–51% by R1 and 28–48% by R2, respectively, indicating that salinity exposure may slightly influence Cr(VI) bioremediation. In addition, salinity exposure stimulated more polysaccharides excretion from algal-bacterial AGS while Cr(VI) exposure promoted proteins excretion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algal-bacterial Aerobic Granular Sludge; Bioremediation; Hexavalent Chromium; Salinity; Wastewater Treatment","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The first author, Bach Van Nguyen, would like to thank the financial and technical support by the Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship by Japanese Grant Aid (JDS), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Institute of Marine Environment and Resources (IMER), Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Vietnam for supporting his study in University of Tsukuba, Japan.; Funding text 2: Funding: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP18H03403.","Sartore, Luciana, Preparation and Heavy Metal Ions Chelating Properties of Multifunctional Polymer-Grafted Silica Hybrid Materials, Advances in Materials Science and Engineering, 2019, (2019); Gibb, Herman Jones, Lung cancer among workers in chromium chemical production, American Journal of Industrial Medicine, 38, 2, pp. 115-126, (2000); Zhitkovich, Anatoly V., Chromium in drinking water: Sources, metabolism, and cancer risks, Chemical Research in Toxicology, 24, 10, pp. 1617-1629, (2011); Tumolo, Marina, Chromium pollution in European water, sources, health risk, and remediation strategies: An overview, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 15, pp. 1-25, (2020); Mitra, Sayak, Removal of chromium from industrial effluents using nanotechnology: a review, Nanotechnology for Environmental Engineering, 2, 1, (2017); Brasili, Elisa, Remediation of hexavalent chromium contaminated water through zero-valent iron nanoparticles and effects on tomato plant growth performance, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Fu, Fenglian, Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 92, 3, pp. 407-418, (2011); Pushkar, Bhupendra Kishanprasad, Chromium pollution and its bioremediation mechanisms in bacteria: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 287, (2021); Joseph, Lesley, Removal of heavy metals from water sources in the developing world using low-cost materials: A review, Chemosphere, 229, pp. 142-159, (2019); Zabochnicka, Magdalena, Potentials of biosorption and bioaccumulation processes for heavy metal removal, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies, 23, 2, pp. 551-561, (2014)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","22279717","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113340694"

Their performance varies on the basis of different specifications; thus, it is necessary to evaluate them to select the best one. Fuzzy set theory allows us to flexibly handle practical problems, especially applied problems in engineering. In this paper, a new similarity measure using fuzzy sets is proposed, and its advantages were tested using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to select technical parameters for the sowing machines. The experiments allowed identifying the best results. The correlations between input attributes and decision variables were determined on the basis of their correlation coefficients with technical factors. The influence of technical factors on output results was also examined to determine the technical factors providing superior product quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air-assisted Rice Seeder; Optimal Plan; Rice Direct Seeding; Similarity Measure Of Fuzzy Sets; Sowing Machines","","","","Acknowledgments: We would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam, the Vietnam National University of Agriculture, and the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology for support.","Japanese Journal of Farm Work Research, (2009); Xu, Le, Comparing the grain yields of direct-seeded and transplanted rice: A meta-analysis, Agronomy, 9, 11, (2019); Loan, Nguyen Thi Thanh, Effect of auxiliary airflow in the seeding tube on an air-assisted seeding for rice paddy, 3, pp. 2507-2514, (2011); Furuhata, Masaini, Developing direct seeding cultivation using an air-assisted strip seeder, Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly, 49, 3, pp. 227-233, (2015); Copyr Int Rice Res Inst, (2005); Zadeh, Lotfi A., Fuzzy sets, Information and control, 8, 3, pp. 338-353, (1965); Dixit, Vijaya, Leveraging tacit knowledge for shipyard facility layout selection using fuzzy set theory, Expert Systems with Applications, 158, (2020); Jin, Xin, Design and implementation of anti-leakage planting system for transplanting machine based on fuzzy information, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 169, (2020); Ertuǧrul, Írfan, Fuzzy multi-criteria decision making method for machine selection, Advances in Soft Computing, 41, pp. 638-648, (2007); Abdi, Mohammad Reza, Fuzzy multi-criteria decision model for evaluating reconfigurable machines, International Journal of Production Economics, 117, 1, pp. 1-15, (2009)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111567587"

To verify these parameters, a fast and high-accuracy motion is required. However, the displacement induced by a mechanical actuator generates disadvantageous features, such as slow motion, hysteresis, distortion, and vibration. This paper proposes a new method for a nonmechanical high-speed motion using an electro-optic modulator (EOM). The method is based on the principle that all displacement measuring interferometers measure the phase change to calculate the displacement. This means that the EOM can be used to accurately generate phase change rather than a mechanical actuator. The proposed method is then validated by placing the EOM into an arm of a frequency modulation interferometer. By using two lock-in amplifiers, the phase change in an EOM and, hence, the corresponding virtual displacement could be measured by the interferometer. The measurement showed that the system could achieve a displacement at 20 kHz, a speed of 6.08 mm/s, and a displacement noise level < 100 pm//√ Hz above 2 kHz. The proposed virtual displacement can be applied to determine both the measurement speed and accuracy of displacement measuring interferometers, such as homodyne interferometers, heterodyne interferometers, and frequency modulated interferometers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Displacement Measuring Interferometer; Electro-optic Modulator; Frequency Modulation","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the Centennial SIT Action for the 100th anniversary of Shibaura Institute of Technology to enter the top ten Asian Institute of Technology.; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology, grant number T2020-PC-201.","Peng, Kai, Features of capacitive displacement sensing that provide high-accuracy measurements with reduced manufacturing precision, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 64, 9, pp. 7377-7386, (2017); Ye, Yong, A Review on Applications of Capacitive Displacement Sensing for Capacitive Proximity Sensor, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 45325-45342, (2020); Chi, Cheng, Recent progress in technologies for tactile sensors, Sensors, 18, 4, (2018); Zhang, Dongdong, Absolute capacitive grating displacement measuring system with both high-precision and long-range, Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, 295, pp. 11-22, (2019); Ye, Guoyong, Development of a reflective optical encoder with submicron accuracy, Optics Communications, 411, pp. 126-132, (2018); Goudarzi Khouygani, Mohammad, High-precision miniaturized low-cost reflective grating laser encoder with nanometric accuracy, Applied Optics, 59, 19, pp. 5764-5771, (2020); Hori, Yasuaki, Periodic error evaluation system for linear encoders using a homodyne laser interferometer with 10 picometer uncertainty, Precision Engineering, 51, pp. 388-392, (2018); Yan, Liping, Phase-modulated dual-homodyne interferometer without periodic nonlinearity, Measurement Science and Technology, 28, 11, (2017); Lou, Yingtian, A phase modulating homodyne interferometer with tilting error compensation by use of an integrated four-photodetector, Review of Scientific Instruments, 90, 2, (2019); Joo, Ki-nam, A compact high-precision periodic-error-free heterodyne interferometer, Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision, 37, 9, pp. B11-B18, (2020)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112215351"

However, in order to increase stability during the forming process, it is necessary to identify and analyze the dependency of the forming pressure and the quality of a product on input parameters. For the purpose of modeling the forming pressure, this paper presents empirical research on the product of a cylindrical cup made of various materials, including carbon steel (DC04), copper (CDA260), and stainless steel (SUS 304) with different thicknesses (0.8 mm, 1.0 mm, and 1.2 mm), under a defined range of binder pressures. The regression method is selected to formulate an equation that shows the relationship between the input parameters, including the materials (ultimate strength and yield stress), workpiece thickness, binder pressure and the output parameter, and the formation of fluid pressure. The mathematical equation allows us to determine the extent of the effect of each input on the forming pressure. The experimental results can be used for the easier planning and forecasting of the process and product quality in hydrostatic forming. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Experimental Modeling; Forming Pressure; Hydroforming; Regression; Sheet Metal Forming","","","","Acknowledgments: This research was funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2020-TT-202.

This study evaluated the performance of a novel flat-sheet submerged NF membrane module at low water flux to minimize membrane fouling. The separation performance of the NF system was assessed by periodically measuring the color, turbidity, pH, UV light absorbance at the wavelength of 254 nm, and total organic carbon concentrations of the NF feed water and permeate. During the 48-d test, negligible membrane fouling was found when direct NF treatment of secondary wastewater effluent was conducted at a water flux of 3 L/m2h. The trans-membrane pressure increased by less than 0.072 kPa/d. The foulant layer on the membrane surface was readily removed by simple physical cleaning, which suggests that the reversible fouling was the major fouling mechanism. Direct NF treatment achieved high and stable removal of organics (total organic carbon removal of >80 %) during the operation period. This study demonstrated the efficacy of the direct NF treatment using a submerged NF module for achieving stable operations and producing high-quality recycled water. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Wastewater Treatment; Direct Nanofiltration; Membrane Fouling Mitigation; Non-potable Water Reuse; Water Reclamation","","","","We thank AWA Paper & Technological Company for providing and assembling an NF membrane module.

One of the possible applications of borophene is gas sensing. However, the interaction between common gases and β12 borophene remains to be clarified. In this work, we study the interactions of β12 borophene towards five hazardous gases, namely, CO, NO, NH3, NO2, and CO2 using various non-empirical van der Waals density functionals and provide an insight into the adsorption behavior of borophene. The adsorption mechanism and molecular vibrations are discussed in great detail. Among the gases considered, CO2 is physisorbed while other gases are chemically bonded to β12 borophene. We also demonstrate that the deformation at the ridge of borophene enables its active pz orbital to strongly hybridize with frontier orbitals of the studied polar gases. Consequently, borophene is predicted to interact strongly with CO, NO, NH3, and especially NO2, making it a sensitive sensing material for toxic gases.

Six kinds of commercial nanofiltration membrane were investigated. The results showed that the rejection of benzoic acid was significantly lower than that of other components in cranberry juice, including sugars and other organic acids. In a range of 2-7.5 L/min, feed flow rate slightly affected the performance of nanofiltration. Higher temperatures resulted in higher permeate flux and lower rejection of benzoic acid, whereas rejection of sugar and organic acid was stable at a high value. In a range of 2.5-5.5, pH also significantly affected the separation of benzoic acid and negative rejection against benzoic acid was observed at pH 4.5 with some of the membranes. This implies that pH 4.5 is considered as an optimum pH for benzoic acid separation from cranberry juice. The lower permeate flux caused a lower rejection of benzoic acid and negative rejection of benzoic acid was observed at the low permeate flux. Pretreatment by ultrafiltration with CR61PP membranes could improve the permeate flux but insignificantly influenced the efficiency of separation. The results also indicated that NF99 and DK membranes can be effectively used to separate benzoic acid from cranberry juice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzoic Acid; Cranberry Juice; Feed Flow Rate; Nanofiltration; Negative Rejection; Fruit Juices; Nanofiltration; Nanofiltration Membranes; Acid Separation; Cranberry Juice; Cross-flow Nanofiltration; Feed Flow Rate; Permeate Flux; Pilot Scale; Pre-treatment; Technological Parameters; Benzoic Acid","Fruit juices; Nanofiltration; Nanofiltration membranes; Acid separation; Cranberry juice; Cross-flow nanofiltration; Feed flow rate; Permeate flux; Pilot scale; Pre-Treatment; Technological parameters; Benzoic acid","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research is funded by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM under grant number HCMUT-002550-2021.; Funding text 2: This research is funded by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNUHCM under grant number HCMUT-002550-2021.","Extraction, (2019); Zuo, Yuegang, Separation, characterization, and quantitation of benzoic and phenolic antioxidants in American cranberry fruit by GC-MS, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 50, 13, pp. 3789-3794, (2002); Pappas, E., Phytochemicals of cranberries and cranberry products: Characterization, potential health effects, and processing stability, Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 49, 9, pp. 741-781, (2009); Abdel-Fatah, Mona A., Nanofiltration systems and applications in wastewater treatment: Review article, Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 9, 4, pp. 3077-3092, (2018); Marchetti, Patrizia, Molecular separation with organic solvent nanofiltration: A critical review, Chemical Reviews, 114, 21, pp. 10735-10806, (2014); Tonova, Konstantza, Separation of glucose, other reducing sugars and phenolics from natural extract by nanofiltration: Effect of pressure and cross-flow velocity, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 162, pp. 107-116, (2020); Esteves, Teresa, A study on lupin beans process wastewater nanofiltration treatment and lupanine recovery, Journal of Cleaner Production, 277, (2020); Khairul Zaman, Nadiah, Recovery of organic acids from fermentation broth using nanofiltration technologies: A review, Journal of Physical Science, 28, pp. 85-109, (2017); Laurio, Michael Vincent O., Process scale-up, economic, environmental assessment of vibratory nanofiltration of coffee extracts for soluble coffee production process intensification, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 22, 9, pp. 1891-1908, (2020); Cassano, Alfredo, Current and future applications of nanofiltration in food processing, pp. 305-348, (2018)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20770375","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105557843"

The colonies exhibited light brown with a diameter ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 mm. For screening their metabolic activities, API 50CHB strips and esculin were used. We phylogenetically typified the isolated bacteria by applying 16S ribosomal DNA gene amplification and sequencing followed by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) tests. About 100 μL of the enriched sample was streaked on nutrient agar using a calibrated wire loop, while 20 μg crude powder was mixed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to test their activities against standard pathogenic bacterial strains (ATCC). The water samples collected from the hot springs had temperatures ranging between 44–56 °C, pH between 7.11–8.51, and electrical conductivity between 1.06–1.41 ms/cm. To utilize their isolate for characterization and applications, pH, temperature, and generation time were optimized. It was found that the Gram-negative isolated bacteria strain exhibited an optimum growth at 55 °C, pH 8.5, and 30 min of generation time (GT). The BLAST results showed a 99 % of similar identity of the sample to Thermomonas hydrothermalis. Due to their antibacterial effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, bioactive compounds identified using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) had novel features such as 4(3 H)-pyrimidinone, dihydroxy-1,5- naphthyridine, actinomycine-D, and pyrrolo [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione hygrazides. Screening of cytotoxic activity tests using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was conducted toward their water extract, which exerted cytostimulatory effects on human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) with an IC<inf>50</inf> of 5.109 μg/mL and accelerated wound closure. Overall, the implications of this study provided new insights into the bioproducts of Thermomonas hydrothermalis and offered opportunities to utilize their isolate for biotechnological and medicinal applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibacterial; Antiproliferative; Blast Analysis; Gc–ms; Thermomonas Hydrothermalis; Bacteria; Biotechnology; Cell Culture; Diagnosis; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Gas Chromatography; Gene Encoding; Gene Expression; Hot Springs; Polysaccharides; Anti-proliferative; Antibacterials; Bacterium Strain; Basic Local Alignment Search Tool Analyse; Basic Local Alignment Search Tools; Gas Chromatography-mass Spectroscopies; Generation Time; Jordan Hot Springs; Morphological Characteristic; Thermomonas Hydrothermali; Mass Spectrometry","Bacteria; Biotechnology; Cell culture; Diagnosis; Dimethyl sulfoxide; Gas chromatography; Gene encoding; Gene expression; Hot springs; Polysaccharides; Anti-proliferative; Antibacterials; Bacterium strain; Basic local alignment search tool analyse; Basic local alignment search tools; Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopies; Generation time; Jordan hot springs; Morphological characteristic; Thermomonas hydrothermali; Mass spectrometry","","","The authors are grateful to the German Jordanian University for the Deanship of Scientific Research Grant No. SAMS 14/2015 .

As the results, the proposed method successfully controlled the shape and structure of the carbon particles from dense to hollow by adjusting the KOH concentration. Especially, this study represents the first demonstration that KOH plays a crucial role in the formation of particles with good sphericity and dense structures.

Nevertheless, engineering data regarding this technology is still small and fragmented.

The textural properties of cashew nut shell char changed significantly following different pathways between CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O gasification. Micropores and mesopores were well developed along with the conversion in the case of H<inf>2</inf>O gasification instead of only micropores in the case of CO<inf>2</inf> gasification. Regarding char gasification kinetics, an increase of the temperature from 800 to 1000°C enhanced five times the conversion rate under an H<inf>2</inf>O atmosphere and 15 times under a CO<inf>2</inf> atmosphere. The conversion rate increased two times when the concentration of reacting gases changed from 20 to 60 vol % for both atmospheres.

Effect of oxidation behavior of Pd core to hydrogen sensing is also investigated for Pd@ZnO CSNPs. Accordingly, Pd@ZnO-2 sensor (core-shell sample was calcined in argon) demonstrates the best performance with respect to Pd@ZnO-1 (core-shell sample was calcined in air) and pure ZnO. It shows a much higher response (R = R<inf>a</inf>/R<inf>g</inf> = 22) than those of Pd@ZnO-1 (12) and pure ZnO (7) sensors with faster response and recovery times (1.4 and 7.8 min) to 100 ppm hydrogen at 350 °C. In addition, Pd@ZnO-2 sensor owns high selectivity to hydrogen among interfering target gases. Improvement can be attributed to the high content of metallic Pd0 species in CSNPs as calcined in argon. Thereby, a higher Pd metallic content (77%) still remains in Pd@ZnO-2 compared to Pd@ZnO-1 (56%), which in turn modulates the resistance of sensors as exposed to air and target gas, thus enhancing gas sensing activity. High BET surface area of core-shell materials provides plenty of active sites for accelerating the sensing reactions as well. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Core-shell; Hydrogen Sensing; Palladium; Surface Area; Zinc Oxide; Acetaldehyde; Alcohol; Argon; Carbon Monoxide; Hydrogen; Methane; Argon; Calcination; Chemical Detection; Core Shell Nanoparticles; Gas Detectors; Gases; Hydrogen; Ii-vi Semiconductors; Nanoparticles; Oxide Minerals; Palladium; Shells (structures); Synthesis (chemical); Zinc Oxide; Bet Surface Area; Core-shell Materials; High Selectivity; Hydrogen Gas Sensing; Hydrogen Gas Sensors; Hydrothermal Routes; Interfering Targets; Oxidation Behaviors; Palladium Compounds; Acetaldehyde; Alcohol; Argon; Carbon Monoxide; Core Shell Nanoparticle; Hydrogen; Methane; Palladium Nanoparticle; Zinc Oxide Nanoparticle; Analytic Method; Article; Barrett Emmett Teller Technique; Calcination Temperature; Electric Resistance; Electron; Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry; Isotherm; Oxidation; Priority Journal; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Surface Area; Surface Property; Synthesis; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction; X Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy","Argon; Calcination; Chemical detection; Core shell nanoparticles; Gas detectors; Gases; Hydrogen; II-VI semiconductors; Nanoparticles; Oxide minerals; Palladium; Shells (structures); Synthesis (chemical); Zinc oxide; BET surface area; Core-shell materials; High selectivity; Hydrogen gas sensing; Hydrogen gas sensors; Hydrothermal routes; Interfering targets; Oxidation behaviors; Palladium compounds; acetaldehyde; alcohol; argon; carbon monoxide; core shell nanoparticle; hydrogen; methane; palladium nanoparticle; zinc oxide nanoparticle; analytic method; Article; barrett emmett teller technique; calcination temperature; electric resistance; electron; field emission scanning electron microscopy; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; isotherm; oxidation; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; surface property; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; alcohol, 64-17-5; argon, 7440-37-1; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; methane, 74-82-8","This work was supported by 1) the BK21-FOUR program of the Ministry of Education and Human-Resource Development, South of Korea; 2) a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (2016R1A2B4014090, 2020R1A2B5B03001603); and 3) Research Base Construction Fund Support Program by Jeonbuk National University in 2018.","Kim, Wonkyung, Reliability and selectivity of H2 sensors composed of Pd Film nanogaps on an elastomeric substrate, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 224, pp. 547-551, (2016); Weber, Matthieu J., High-Performance Nanowire Hydrogen Sensors by Exploiting the Synergistic Effect of Pd Nanoparticles and Metal-Organic Framework Membranes, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 10, 40, pp. 34765-34773, (2018); van Dao, Dung, Plasmonically driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of a Pt-functionalized Au@CeO2 core-shell catalyst under visible light, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 8, 16, pp. 7687-7694, (2020); Turner, John A., Sustainable hydrogen production, Science, 305, 5686, pp. 972-974, (2004); Jang, Byungjin, Thermal stability of the sensing properties in H2 sensors composed of Pd nanogaps on an Elastomeric Substrate, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 240, pp. 186-192, (2017); Cho, Sooyeon, Ultrasmall Grained Pd Nanopattern H2 Sensor, ACS Sensors, 3, 9, pp. 1876-1883, (2018); Buttner, William J., An overview of hydrogen safety sensors and requirements, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 36, 3, pp. 2462-2470, (2011); undefined, (2008); Gu, Haoshuang, Hydrogen gas sensors based on semiconductor oxide nanostructures, Sensors, 12, 5, pp. 5517-5550, (2012); Park, Sang Hoon, Enhancement of hydrogen sensing response of ZnO nanowires for the decoration of WO3 nanoparticles, Materials Letters, 234, pp. 315-318, (2019)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10957103; 00219797","","JCISA","33360898","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098888024"

Major technological and economic challenges will need to be overcome, and one main issue to be tackled is the reduction of water usage in this process. Therefore, the leached metal solutions are expected to contain ultra-high metal concentrations, up to 10 mol/l. These solutions will have challenging thermodynamic properties (increased density, viscosity and interfacial tension). As a result, an analysis of dimensionless numbers for fluidics and mass transport was made, showing that some of these are favourable under the constraints of accessible microfluidic operations. Experiments were performed with advanced microfluidic reactors (a coiled-flow inverter (CFI) and an industrial re-entrance flow reactor from Corning®) at high metal concentrations and high nickel to cobalt ratios (3:0.3 mol/l Ni:Co). Using Cyanex 272 as a selective extractant for cobalt, extraction efficiencies of 60% with high separation factors (>1000) were reached in just one extraction stage. The CFI showed high extraction efficiency for low fluid velocities and a residence time of 60 s. For the Corning® reactor, high fluid velocities or the use of many modules (>3) are needed to obtain an emulsion, resulting in high extraction efficiencies at a very short residence time of 13 s. The comparison between the CFI and the Corning® reactor shows that they share the best operation point (at 120 ml/h), but the Corning® reactor performs better at higher flow rates and thus can leverage higher productivity. However, the CFI is easier to operate and has a much lower pressure drop, resulting in low energy input. Finally, an iron meteorite sample was leached and efficiently extracted in both microfluidic reactors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asteroid; Cobalt; Coiled-flow Inverter; Corning Re-entrance Flow Reactor; Cyanex 272; Microfluidic Devices; Nickel; Solvent Extraction; Space Mining; Asteroids; Cobalt; Emulsification; Leaching; Nickel; Solvent Extraction; Cobalt And Nickels; Dimensionless Number; Economic Challenges; Extraction Efficiencies; In-situ Resource Utilizations; Metal Concentrations; Micro-fluidic Reactors; Microfluidic Operations; Microfluidics","Asteroids; Cobalt; Emulsification; Leaching; Nickel; Solvent extraction; Cobalt and nickels; Dimensionless number; Economic challenges; Extraction efficiencies; In-situ resource utilizations; Metal concentrations; Micro-fluidic reactors; Microfluidic operations; Microfluidics","","","Corning S.A.S. is acknowledged for providing the Corning® Advanced-Flow™ Low Flow Reactor and for technical and scientific support in flow reactor operation.

Like mesopo-rous silica nanoparticles (MSN), BPMO possesses a large surface area where various compounds can be attached. In this work, we attached boronophenylalanine (10BPA) to the surface and explored the potential of this nanomaterial for delivering boron-10 for use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This cancer therapy is based on the principle that the exposure of boron-10 to thermal neutron results in the release of α-particles that kill cancer cells. To attach10BPA, the surface of BPMO was modified with diol groups which facilitated the efficient binding of10BPA, yielding10BPA-loaded BPMO (10 BPA-BPMO). Surface modification with phosphonate was also carried out to increase the dispersibility of the nanoparticles. To investigate this nanomaterial’s potential for BNCT, we first used human cancer cells and found that10 BPA-BPMO nanoparticles were efficiently taken up into the cancer cells and were localized in perinuclear regions. We then used a chicken egg tumor model, a versatile and convenient tumor model used to characterize nanomaterials. After observing significant tumor accumulation,10 BPA-BPMO injected chicken eggs were evaluated by irradiating with neutron beams. Dramatic inhibition of the tumor growth was observed. These results suggest the potential of10BPA-BPMO as a novel boron agent for BNCT. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradable Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica; Boron Neutron Capture Therapy; Boronophenylalanine; Cancer Cells; Chicken Egg Tumor Model; 4 Boronophenylalanine; Boron 10; Phenylalanine; Antineoplastic Agents; Boron Compounds; Organosilicon Compounds; Phenylalanine; 4 Boronophenylalanine; Boron 10; Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle; Nanomaterial; Nanoparticle; Phosphonic Acid Derivative; Antineoplastic Agent; Boron Derivative; Metal Nanoparticle; Organosilicon Derivative; Phenylalanine; Alpha Radiation; Article; Bioaccumulation; Biodegradability; Boron Neutron Capture Therapy; Cancer Inhibition; Cancer Therapy; Cell Killing; Chemical Binding; Chemical Modification; Chicken; Controlled Study; Egg; Human; Human Cell; Neutron Radiation; Nonhuman; Particle Size; Surface Area; Tumor Growth; Tumor Model; Tumor Volume; Tumor Weight; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Chemistry; Neoplasm; Pathology; Tumor Cell Culture; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Boron Compounds; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Organosilicon Compounds; Phenylalanine; Tumor Cells, Cultured","4 boronophenylalanine; boron 10; mesoporous silica nanoparticle; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; phosphonic acid derivative; antineoplastic agent; boron derivative; metal nanoparticle; organosilicon derivative; phenylalanine; alpha radiation; Article; bioaccumulation; biodegradability; boron neutron capture therapy; cancer inhibition; cancer therapy; cell killing; chemical binding; chemical modification; chicken; controlled study; egg; human; human cell; neutron radiation; nonhuman; particle size; surface area; tumor growth; tumor model; tumor volume; tumor weight; apoptosis; cell proliferation; chemistry; neoplasm; pathology; tumor cell culture; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Boron Compounds; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Organosilicon Compounds; Phenylalanine; Tumor Cells, Cultured","","4 boronophenylalanine, 76410-58-7; boron 10, 14798-12-0; phenylalanine, 3617-44-5, 63-91-2; Antineoplastic Agents; Boron Compounds; Organosilicon Compounds; Phenylalanine","Funding text 1: This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI grant number JP15K21764 and JP20H00331, AMED grant 19ck016469h0001, a grant from Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City grant number TX2021-50-01 and from the Kyoto University?TAE Lifesciences collaboration grant.

MW absorption ability of catalyst governed by its particle size is the foremost important factor to be considered before designing catalysts for such MW-based chemistry. Despite considerable interest in applying metallic-based catalysts for MW-assisted reactions, the influences of particle size on catalyst's MW absorption ability and its resultant activity remain elusive. Here, we report an effective approach to tailor the MW absorption ability of Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> catalyst via controlling its particle size during the crystal growth. A developed theoretical model verified that a capping agent could regulate Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particle size effectively. For the unsupported Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> catalysts, smaller particle size possessed higher MW absorption capacity and thereby delivered higher activity for MW-assisted bi-reforming of methane. High conversion of 63% CH<inf>4</inf> and a syngas ratio (H<inf>2</inf>/CO) of 2.2 was achieved with the smallest Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles, at 20 nm. In contrast, the supported Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> samples required larger particles to ensure adequate exposure to the incident MW, which is partially covered by MW-inert support. The results disclose that by tailoring particles size appropriately, metallic-based catalysts can be optimised for MW-based chemical reactions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bi-reforming; Capping Agent; Co3o4 Catalyst; Microwave Absorption; Particle Size; Nanocatalysts; Particle Size; Reforming Reactions; Absorption Abilities; Absorption Capacity; Effective Approaches; High Conversions; Microwave Absorption; Reaction Activity; Reforming Of Methane; Theoretical Modeling; Silicon Compounds","Nanocatalysts; Particle size; Reforming reactions; Absorption abilities; Absorption capacity; Effective approaches; High conversions; Microwave absorption; Reaction activity; Reforming of methane; Theoretical modeling; Silicon compounds","","","Authors acknowledge the financial support from Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage project - LP150101158.","García-Baños, Beatriz, Temperature Assessment Of Microwave-Enhanced Heating Processes, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Nguyen, Hoang Minh, Microwave-assisted catalytic methane reforming: A review, Applied Catalysis A: General, 599, (2020); Yoshikawa, Noboru, Fundamentals and applications of microwave heating of metals, Journal of Microwave Power and Electromagnetic Energy, 44, 1, pp. 4-13, (2010); Liu, Lidong, Influence of particle size on the electromagnetic and microwave absorption properties of FeSi/paraffin composites, Physica B: Condensed Matter, 406, 11, pp. 2261-2265, (2011); Crane, Charles A., The effects of particle size on microwave heating of metal and metal oxide powders, Powder Technology, 256, pp. 113-117, (2014); Cai, Xudong, Effect of particle size on the preparation and microwave absorption properties of FeSiAl magnetically soft alloy hollow microspheres, Defence Technology, 14, 5, pp. 477-483, (2018); Nguyen, Hoang Minh, Dry reforming of methane over Co-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst under low microwave power irradiation, Catalysis Science and Technology, 8, 20, pp. 5315-5324, (2018); Energy Fuels, (2020); Dudley, Gregory B., On the existence of and mechanism for microwave-specific reaction rate enhancement, Chemical Science, 6, 4, pp. 2144-2152, (2015); Nakhaei Pour, Ali, Size dependence on reduction kinetic of iron based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 17, 3, pp. 596-602, (2011)","","Korean Society of Industrial Engineering Chemistry","","","","","","1226086X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096427814"

In the present study, we investigate the structural, elastic, and electronic properties of hexagonal boron phosphide monolayer functionalized by Br and Cl atoms using first-principles predictions. Once surface-functionalized with Br/Cl atoms, the planar structure of BP monolayer is transformed to the low-buckled lattice with the bucking constant of about 0.6 Å for all four configurations of functionalized boron phosphide,i.e., Cl-BP-Cl, Cl-BP-Br, Br-BP-Cl, and Br-BP-Br. The stability of functionalized BP monolayers is confirmedviatheir phonon spectra analysis andab initiomolecular dynamics simulations. Our calculations indicate that the functionalized BP monolayers possess a fully isotropic elastic characteristic with the perfect circular shape of the angle-dependent Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio due to the hexagonal symmetry. The Cl-BP-Cl is the most stiff with the Young's modulusC<inf>2D</inf>= 43.234 N m−1. All four configurations of the functionalized boron phosphide are direct semiconductors with a larger band gap than that of a pure BP monolayer. The outstanding stability, isotropic elastic properties, and moderate band gap make functionalized boron phosphide a very intriguing candidate for next-generation nanoelectromechanical devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bromine Compounds; Calculations; Elastic Moduli; Electronic Properties; Energy Gap; Iii-v Semiconductors; Monolayers; Dynamics Simulation; Elastic Characteristic; Elastic Properties; Hexagonal Symmetry; Mechanical And Electronic Properties; Nanoelectromechanical Devices; Surface Functionalization; Two-dimensional Systems; Chlorine Compounds","Bromine compounds; Calculations; Elastic moduli; Electronic properties; Energy gap; III-V semiconductors; Monolayers; Dynamics simulation; Elastic characteristic; Elastic properties; Hexagonal symmetry; Mechanical and electronic properties; Nanoelectromechanical devices; Surface Functionalization; Two-dimensional systems; Chlorine compounds","","","This work is supported by the Belarusian National Research Program “Convergence-2025”.","Siahlo, Andrei I., Structure and energetics of carbon, hexagonal boron nitride, and carbon/hexagonal boron nitride single-layer and bilayer nanoscrolls, Physical Review Materials, 2, 3, (2018); Poklonski, Nikolai A., Synergy of physical properties of low-dimensional carbon-based systems for nanoscale device design, Materials Research Express, 6, 4, (2019); Vu, Tuan V., Computational prediction of electronic and optical properties of Janus Ga2SeTe monolayer, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 53, 45, (2020); Nguyen, Hong Tham Thi, Electronic and optical properties of a Janus SnSSe monolayer: Effects of strain and electric field, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 22, 20, pp. 11637-11643, (2020); Nguyen, Chuong V., Interlayer coupling and electric field controllable Schottky barriers and contact types in graphene/ PbI2 heterostructures, Physical Review B, 101, 23, (2020); Nguyen, Hong Tham Thi, Interfacial characteristics, Schottky contact, and optical performance of a graphene/Ga2 SSe van der Waals heterostructure: Strain engineering and electric field tunability, Physical Review B, 102, 7, (2020); Ruoff, Rodney S., Graphene: Calling all chemists, Nature Nanotechnology, 3, 1, pp. 10-11, (2008); Zhang, Weibing, The tunable electronic structure and mechanical properties of halogenated silicene: A first-principles study, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, 3, 13, pp. 3087-3094, (2015); Karlický, František, Halogenated graphenes: Rapidly growing family of graphene derivatives, ACS Nano, 7, 8, pp. 6434-6464, (2013); Cadelano, Emiliano, Elastic properties of hydrogenated graphene, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 82, 23, (2010)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20462069","","RSCAC","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101832684"

The physicochemical, structural and functional properties and elemental composition of the nanoflakes had been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV–VIS spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the photocatalytic actions of the nanoflakes were evaluated by the removal rates of methylene blue (MB) and p-nitrophenol (4-NP) under UV irradiation at room temperature. SEM-EDS studies revealed that the nanoflakes consisted of mixed oxide such as magnesium oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO) particles. The size of the nanoflakes was found to be in the range of 10–30 nm and the average size was 25 nm as confirmed by HR-TEM analysis. XRD revealed that the standard crystal size was calculated to be 25 nm. The synthesized nanoflakes had a strong photocatalytic activity for methylene blue (MB) and p-nitrophenol (4-NP) degradation in the presence of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> under UV light irradiation within 60 min and 30 min, respectively. Hence, the present study proposes that the CaMgO<inf>2</inf> nanoflakes can be employed for the removal of dyes from wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-precipitation; Dye Degradation; Methylene Blue; Mixed Metal Oxide; Nanoflakes; Ultrasound-assisted Synthesis; Calcium; Magnesium Oxide; Methylene Blue; Nicolet; Calcium Oxide; Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Irradiation; Lime; Magnesia; Oxide Minerals; Particle Size Analysis; Phenols; Photocatalytic Activity; Physicochemical Properties; Precipitation (chemical); Scanning Electron Microscopy; Stripping (dyes); Ultrasonics; X Ray Diffraction; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Calcium Magnesium Oxides; Coprecipitation Method; Elemental Compositions; Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy; Functional Properties; Photo Catalytic Degradation; Photo-catalytic; Uv-light Irradiation; Magnesium Metallography; Calcium; Magnesium Oxide; Methylene Blue; Nanoflake; Article; Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Nonhuman; Photocatalysis; Physical Chemistry; Priority Journal; Raman Spectrometry; Room Temperature; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Structure Activity Relation; Ultrasound; Ultraviolet Irradiation; Ultraviolet Visible Spectroscopy; X Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy","Calcium oxide; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Irradiation; Lime; Magnesia; Oxide minerals; Particle size analysis; Phenols; Photocatalytic activity; Physicochemical properties; Precipitation (chemical); Scanning electron microscopy; Stripping (dyes); Ultrasonics; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Calcium magnesium oxides; Coprecipitation method; Elemental compositions; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Functional properties; Photo catalytic degradation; Photo-catalytic; UV-light irradiation; Magnesium metallography; calcium; magnesium oxide; methylene blue; nanoflake; Article; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; high resolution transmission electron microscopy; nonhuman; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; room temperature; scanning electron microscopy; structure activity relation; ultrasound; ultraviolet irradiation; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy","","calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; magnesium oxide, 1309-48-4, 1317-74-4; methylene blue, 61-73-4","","Cao, Changyan, Superb adsorption capacity and mechanism of flowerlike magnesium oxide nanostructures for lead and cadmium ions, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 4, 8, pp. 4283-4287, (2012); Lin, Tingan, Weaving carbon fiber/recycled polypropylene selvages to reinforce the polymer-based protective composite fabrics: Manufacturing techniques and electromagnetic shielding effectiveness, Polymer Composites, 40, S2, pp. E1910-E1917, (2019); Jamee, Radia, Biodegradation of synthetic dyes of textile effluent by microorganisms: An environmentally and economically sustainable approach, European Journal of Microbiology and Immunology, 9, 4, pp. 114-118, (2019); Al-Sakkaf, Basem Mohammed, Degradation Pattern of Textile Effluent by Using Bio and Sono Chemical Reactor, Journal of Chemistry, 2020, (2020); Mittal, Alok, Decoloration treatment of a hazardous triarylmethane dye, Light Green SF (Yellowish) by waste material adsorbents, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 342, 2, pp. 518-527, (2010); Liu, Airong, One-pot hydrothermal synthesis of hematite-reduced graphene oxide composites for efficient removal of malachite green from aqueous solution, RSC Advances, 5, 22, pp. 17336-17342, (2015); Kant, Shashi, Removal of malachite green and methylene blue by Fe0.01Ni0.01Zn0.98O/polyacrylamide nanocomposite using coupled adsorption and photocatalysis, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 147, pp. 340-352, (2014); Samuel, Melvin S., Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Application for cytotoxicity effect on A549 cell line and photocatalytic degradation of p-nitrophenol, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology, 202, (2020); Xiong, Zhaokun, Removal of nitrophenols and their derivatives by chemical redox: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 359, pp. 13-31, (2019); Khan, Faheem Ullah, Antioxidant and catalytic applications of silver nanoparticles using Dimocarpus longan seed extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology, 164, pp. 344-351, (2016)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10957103; 00219797","","JCISA","33189317","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096042333"

Spatial-temporal variations in PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels can provide useful information about the sources and transportation of PM<inf>2.5</inf>. However, the published spatial-temporal data in the area are limited. In this research, PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations at two sites in Hanoi and a site in Thai Nguyen (60 km north of Hanoi) were observed from October 2017 to April 2018, using newly available low-cost sensors. Hourly concentrations of PM<inf>2.5</inf> at the three sites were similar on average (57.5, 54.9, and 53.6 μg m−3) and clearly co-varied, suggesting remarkable large-scale effects. The contribution of long-range transport and meteorological factors on PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels were investigated with a machine learning technique based on a random forest (RF) algorithm and concentration weight trajectory (CWT). The results showed that the contribution of long-range transport from the north and northeast to local PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels was significant. Moreover, weather normalized PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations and partial plots of meteorological factors on the levels of PM<inf>2.5</inf> showed that meteorological conditions play a significant role in the formation of winter haze events. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerosol; Long-range Transport; Machine Learning; Meteorology; Pm2.5 Sensor; Atmospheric Movements; Decision Trees; Turing Machines; Air Pollution Episodes; Large-scale Effects; Long Range Transport; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine Learning Techniques; Meteorological Condition; Meteorological Factors; Spatial-temporal Data; Machine Learning; Atmospheric Pollution; Climate Conditions; Climate Effect; Concentration (composition); Episodic Event; Haze; Long Range Transport; Machine Learning; Particulate Matter; Research Work; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Aerosol; Air Monitoring; Article; Atmospheric Pressure; Environmental Temperature; Human; Humidity; Meteorology; Particulate Matter 2.5; Priority Journal; Random Forest; Viet Nam; Weather; Winter; Hanoi; Thai Nguyen","Atmospheric movements; Decision trees; Turing machines; Air pollution episodes; Large-scale effects; Long range transport; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Spatial-temporal data; Machine learning; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; climate effect; concentration (composition); episodic event; haze; long range transport; machine learning; particulate matter; research work; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air monitoring; Article; atmospheric pressure; environmental temperature; human; humidity; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; random forest; Viet Nam; weather; winter; Hanoi; Thai Nguyen","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Life Solutions Company, Panasonic Corporation for providing the PM 2.5 sensors.

A down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor is a novel aerobic wastewater treatment process that utilizes a sponge as a biomass-retaining carrier. This sponge carrier has both aerobic and anaerobic zones owing to different dissolved oxygen concentrations. In this study, the process performance of a DHS reactor treating actual textile wastewater obtained from a factory in Japan was evaluated. The effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and effluent recirculation (recirculation ratio = 1) on the DHS process performance were investigated. The DHS reactor showed good organic (up to 93 ± 13% of BOD) and nitrogen removal (56 ± 14% of TN) abilities during the entire experimental period. The color removal efficiencies of the DHS reactor were 55 ± 15%, 53 ± 26%, 72 ± 34%, and 35 ± 22% with HRTs of 4 h, 4 h + effluent recirculation (R = 1), 8 h + effluent recirculation (R = 1), and 8 h, respectively. Microbial community structure analysis of the DHS retained sludge showed that genus Acinetobacter was detected predominantly and reported as an azo dye-degrading bacterium. Effluent recirculation was also observed to increase the presence of aromatic-degrading bacteria and protists in the DHS reactor. These results suggest that the DHS reactor is suitable for textile wastewater treatment. Furthermore, the effluent recirculation is effective for enhancing decolorization performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological Wastewater Treatment; Textile Wastewater; Trickling Filter Reactor","","","","This research was supported from Ministry of Environment, Japan .

The effects of main operational parameters including the initial pH, MB concentration, catalyst dosage, and ultrasonic power on the coupled US/NC<inf>ZIF-67</inf> process were investigated. The addition of radical scavengers and enhancers revealed the main role of reactive oxygen species in the treatment process particularly hydroxyl radicals ([rad]OH), in which their presence is confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The GC–MS method was performed for recognition of the seven detectable intermediates during the MB degradation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","N-doped Graphitic Carbon; Sonocatalyst; Thiazine-based Dye; Ultrasonic Process; Zeolitic Imidazole Framework; Aromatic Compounds; Carbon; Catalysts; Etching; Hydrofluoric Acid; Graphitic Carbons; Nano-architecture; Nanoporous Carbons; Operational Parameters; Photoluminescence Spectrum; Radical Scavengers; Sonocatalytic Degradation; Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks; Doping (additives)","Aromatic compounds; Carbon; Catalysts; Etching; Hydrofluoric acid; Graphitic carbons; Nano-architecture; Nanoporous carbons; Operational parameters; Photoluminescence spectrum; Radical scavengers; Sonocatalytic degradation; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Doping (additives)","","","The authors wish to thank the University of Tabriz for the support provided (Project No: 825, 97.3.5).","Doustkhah, Esmail, Microporous layered silicates: Old but new microporous materials, New Journal of Chemistry, 44, 24, pp. 9957-9968, (2020); Doustkhah, Esmail, Bursting Exfoliation of a Microporous Layered Silicate to Three-Dimensionally Meso-Microporous Nanosheets for Improved Molecular Recognition, ACS Applied Nano Materials, 2, 12, pp. 7513-7520, (2019); Zebardasti, Ali, Carbamate-Isocyanurate-Bridged Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica for van der Waals CO2Capture, Inorganic Chemistry, 59, 16, pp. 11223-11227, (2020); Mohammad, Munirah Izzah Binti, Metal-Organic-Framework-Based Enzymatic Microfluidic Biosensor via Surface Patterning and Biomineralization, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 11, 2, pp. 1807-1820, (2019); Hu, Maolin, Taking organic reactions over metal-organic frameworks as heterogeneous catalysis, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 256, pp. 111-127, (2018); Tran, Uyen P.N., Expanding applications of metal-organic frameworks: Zeolite imidazolate framework zif-8 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the knoevenagel reaction, ACS Catalysis, 1, 2, pp. 120-127, (2011); Zhao, Shenlong, Carbonized nanoscale metal-organic frameworks as high performance electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, ACS Nano, 8, 12, pp. 12660-12668, (2014); Yang, Jian, Hollow Zn/Co ZIF Particles Derived from Core-Shell ZIF-67@ZIF-8 as Selective Catalyst for the Semi-Hydrogenation of Acetylene, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 54, 37, pp. 10889-10893, (2015); Wang, Mang, Metal-organic frameworks (ZIF-67) as efficient cocatalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO2: The role of the morphology effect, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 6, 11, pp. 4768-4775, (2018); Razmjou, Amir A., Preparation of Iridescent 2D Photonic Crystals by Using a Mussel-Inspired Spatial Patterning of ZIF-8 with Potential Applications in Optical Switch and Chemical Sensor, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 9, 43, pp. 38076-38080, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18733794; 13835866","","SPUTF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092298087"

The UF treated under air formed the needle-like crystals which were assumed to be mullite-related substances formed by transformation of andalusite, because the crystals are mainly composed of SiO2 and Al2O3. In contrast to the UF, the IL did not generate such crystals; however, when the IL was treated under air after carbonization under Ar, crystals appeared. The composition of the UF with an Al/Si ratio higher than that of the IL favored the formation of mullite-related substances, while the presence of lime in the IL inhibited the formation of mullite-related substances. Oldhamite was formed by the reaction of lime with sulfur at the carbonization of the IL under Ar and remained even at the successive air treatment. As lime was consumed, the formation of mullite-related substances was ceased to be inhibited under air after Ar treatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","A part of this work (TEM–EDS) was supported by Nagoya University microstructural characterization platform as a program of “Nanotechnology Platform” of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

ASEAN countries especially have an abundant amount of bamboo that has been use for decades in various applications through their civilization. This study aims to determine the feasibility of bamboo as a renewable energy resource in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Japan. This paper reviews general biomass bamboo, availability, and methods of technology in the respective countries based on the review of publication papers and country reports. This fast-growing crop is identical for biomass production as it rapidly self-propagates. Bamboo requires minimum maintenance to grow and is always accessible to be harvested. The woody nature of the tropical bamboo stem contributes to its high calorific value in the form of energy. It was found that Indonesia had become a leading country in generating renewable energy via biomass bamboo through a power plant with a capacity of 700 kW off-grid in Mentawai, Japan with a power generation capacity of 995 kW and Malaysia with 4 MW, will be commercialised by 2023 and 2022. In conclusion, biomass bamboo has great potential for renewable energy generation within these countries. This has consequently contributed to increase in the value of bamboos while positively impacting the socioeconomic stance of the community. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Aboyade, Akinwale O., Thermogravimetric study of the pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics of coal blends with corn and sugarcane residues, Fuel Processing Technology, 106, pp. 310-320, (2013); Beňová, Denisa, Energy potential of agri residual biomass in southeast asia with the focus on Vietnam, Agronomy, 11, 1, (2021); Chin, Kit Ling, Bioenergy Production from Bamboo: Potential Source from Malaysia’s Perspective, BioResources, 12, 3, pp. 6844-6867, (2017); 700 Kwp Biomass Gasifier in Mentawai Indonesia, (2021); Powering the Indonesian Archipelago, (2019); Eker, Mehmet, Labor-intensive techniques for recovering energy biomass from forest tending operations, Biomass and Bioenergy, 115, pp. 223-230, (2018); Electrical Valorization of Bamboo in Africa Technical Benchmark of Small Scale Woody Biomass to Electricity Technologies Application to Inbar S Project to Valorize Bamboo in Rwanda, (2012); Geng, Cengceng, Pyrolysis characteristics of bituminous coal, Journal of the Energy Institute, 89, 4, pp. 725-730, (2016); Gggi Engaged on Community Based Bamboo Biomass to Energy in Indonesia at the Global Landscape Forum Luxembourg 2019, (2019); Why Bioenergy Feed in Tariffs and the Art of Sweetening the Deal for Bioenergy, (2020)","","Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC","","","","","","22839216","9788895608419; 9788895608372; 9788895608426; 9788895608143; 9788895608051; 9788895608624; 9788895608112; 9788895608617; 9788895608648; 9788895608365","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122565997"

This study aims at introducing a biowaste treatment with a conventional aerobic composting method, the T-COM V2.0 system. The model is a horizontal rotary drum with the same operating principle as the in-vessel composting system, with a capacity of 200 L, equivalent to 10 kg/d. Four models are alternately operated at DNC primary school for kitchen waste treatment, with the combination of effective microorganisms to improve decomposition efficiency and reduce odor. The Compost showed positive results with organic matter 2.5 times higher than the Vietnamese standard on organic fertilizer, odorless, non-contaminated by heavy metal, and can be applied for cultivation or improving soil condition. Within three months of operation, the system had shown efficiency impact with more than 1 t of organic waste treated and is possible to replicate at households, restaurants, hotels with outstanding features like technical assurance, economic optimization, operational simplification, and ease of application.

A poor fit can cause difficulty in gait, and, in the worst cases, it can cause inflammation. An evaluation system for checking the fit that utilizes human models has been developed. Human models of the residual limb and lower thigh with bone, muscle, and fat were composed. These models were used to evaluate the fit of the transfemoral socket and ankle foot orthosis (AFO) by dynamic finite-element analysis (FEA). For the transfemoral socket, insertion simulation was performed, and the validity of the fat part and pressure distribution of the residual limb were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging and the force measured by sensors built in the socket. For the AFO, gait simulation of the stance phase was performed, and the transition of strain was compared with the measured result by the 3D-printed AFO, on which strain gauges were pasted. In addition, by performing topological optimization, the weight of the AFO can be reduced by maintaining the stiffness of the AFO. The results indicate the qualitative validity of dynamic FEA for analyzing the prosthesis socket and AFO using a human leg model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Finite Element Analysis; Human Model; Orthosis; Prosthesis; Artificial Limbs; Biochemical Engineering; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Ankle Foot Orthosis (afo); Dynamic Finite Element Analysis; Human Model; Measured Results; Orthosis; Residual Limb; Topological Optimization; Transfemoral; 3d Printers","Artificial limbs; Biochemical engineering; Magnetic resonance imaging; Ankle foot orthosis (AFO); Dynamic finite element analysis; Human Model; Measured results; Orthosis; Residual limb; Topological optimization; Transfemoral; 3D printers","","","Funding text 1: AFO produced by the 3D printer was provided by Konica Minolta Inc.

Optimization on SWCS have always been a primary mission of SWM towards sustainability. Hoi An city (HAC) is a tourist attraction in the central of Vietnam with omnipresence of tourism activities especially in tourism destination (TD). As a result, optimization of SWCS towards sustainability is crucial for TD of HAC. This study aimed to offer understandings on the current SWCS. This study was conducted with GPS (Global Positioning System) logger and QGIS 3.4 to collect and analyze data of existing SWCS. Results showed that, four modes of transportation were used for solid waste collection activities (SWCA) with almost all of sources of WG in the morning. Largest figures for total number of route (29) and amount of waste collected by carts (19.6m3) were illustrated in the morning shift (MS). Illegal solid waste collection (SWC) accounted for about 10 % of total amount of waste collected by carts. Forklift trucks were the final disposal of all SWCA in TD. Current waste gathering (WG) practices indirectly damaged the tourism activities while the improper implementation of selective waste collection at source hindered the efficiency of SWCS in TD. This study made a contribution as a scientific base for optimization and administration of SWCS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors are thankful to Hoi An Public Work Company for supporting the survey and Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University for financial support.","Ferronato, Navarro, Assessment of municipal solid waste selective collection scenarios with geographic information systems in Bolivia, Waste Management, 102, pp. 919-931, (2020); Journal of Jsce, (2017); Hoang, Minh Giang, Waste-to-landfill reduction: Assessment of cost-effective solutions using an optimisation model, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 78, pp. 511-516, (2020); What A Waste A Global Review of Solid Waste Management, (2012); Journal of Environmental and Social Sciences, (2018); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Enhancing waste management practice - The appropriate strategy for improving solid waste management system in Vietnam towards sustainability, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 78, pp. 319-324, (2020); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Waste separation at source and recycling potential of the hotel industry in Hoi An city, Vietnam, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 21, 1, pp. 23-34, (2019); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Solid waste management practice in a tourism destination – The status and challenges: A case study in Hoi An City, Vietnam, Waste Management and Research, 37, 11, pp. 1077-1088, (2019); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Analyzing solid waste management practices for the hotel industry, Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management, 4, 1, pp. 19-30, (2018); Sumathi, V.

This study aims to characterise the waste generation, composition and characteristics of MSW in Da Nang city, which is one of the five biggest cities in Vietnam. The current problems and challenges of MSW system are also analysed. The sampling survey was conducted in the dry and wet seasons in August and November 2018. The MSW was taken directly from trucks at the landfill site with the sample size by 500 kg/waste sources. This study shows that the simultaneous development of production, trade and service activities in the last decade has led to the speedy growth of waste by 9 %/y, and reached 1,073 t/d in 2018. In which, waste generated from industry and the hospitals account inconsiderable proportions by 3.9 % and 1.4 %. This study also indicated that the MSW generation rate from the urban areas is more than that of the coastal and industrial areas. For the composition of MSW, biodegradable waste and recyclables are the main components with the proportion of 54 % and 27 % of the total waste. While the waste composition almost do not differ considerably by seasons, the difference in the characteristics of waste is a consideration for the processing. The current problems and solutions to improve the MSW system toward sustainability are also discussed and suggested. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Cui, Linli, Urbanization and its environmental effects in Shanghai, China, Urban Climate, 2, pp. 1-15, (2012); Hoang, Minh Giang, Waste-to-landfill reduction: Assessment of cost-effective solutions using an optimisation model, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 78, pp. 511-516, (2020); Kato, Takaaki, Waste generation in traditional organized bazaars: a case study of organic waste sources in Da Nang City, Viet Nam, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 19, 2, pp. 977-987, (2017); undefined, (1995); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Enhancing waste management practice - The appropriate strategy for improving solid waste management system in Vietnam towards sustainability, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 78, pp. 319-324, (2020); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Analyzing solid waste management practices for the hotel industry, Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management, 4, 1, pp. 19-30, (2018); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Waste separation at source and recycling potential of the hotel industry in Hoi An city, Vietnam, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 21, 1, pp. 23-34, (2019); Report of 10 Years for Environmental City, (2019)","","Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC","","","","","","22839216","9788895608419; 9788895608372; 9788895608426; 9788895608143; 9788895608051; 9788895608624; 9788895608112; 9788895608617; 9788895608648; 9788895608365","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100979523"

Changes in the methane production and rumen microbiome by CNSL feeding were monitored by a respiration chamber and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing respectively. The results demonstrated that CNSL feeding mitigated 20.2%–23.4% of the CH<inf>4</inf> emission in vivo without apparent adverse effects on feed intake and feed digestibility. The rumen fluid analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of propionate in the total short-chain fatty acids. The relative abundance of methanogen (order Methanobacteriales) decreased significantly, indicating the direct inhibitory effect of CNSL on methanogens. The predicted function of the rumen microbiome indicated that carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms including propionate production were upregulated by CNSL feeding, whereas CH<inf>4</inf> metabolism was downregulated. A network analysis revealed that methanogen changed its partner bacteria after CNSL feeding. The δ13C of CH<inf>4</inf> ranged from −74.2‰ to −66.6‰ with significant fluctuation by CNSL feeding, in agreement with the shift of the rumen microbiome. Our findings demonstrate that CNSL feeding can mitigate the CH<inf>4</inf> emission from local cattle production systems in South-East Asia by modifying the rumen microbiome and its function. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Methane; Propionic Acid; Methane; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Methane; Propionic Acid; Rna 16s; 16s Rrna Gene; Amplicon; Animal Experiment; Animal Tissue; Article; Bovine; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cashew Nut; Cashew Nut Shell Liquid; Controlled Study; Down Regulation; Dry Matter Intake; Feeding Behavior; Gene Sequence; In Vivo Study; Lai Sind Cattle; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Methanobacteriales; Microbiome; Nonhuman; Ph; Prediction; Rumen Microbiome; Anacardium; Animal; Animal Food; Diet; Fermentation; Genetics; Metabolism; Microflora; Nut; Rumen; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Fermentation; Methane; Microbiota; Nuts; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Rumen","methane; propionic acid; RNA 16S; 16S rRNA gene; amplicon; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bovine; carbohydrate metabolism; cashew nut; cashew nut shell liquid; controlled study; down regulation; dry matter intake; feeding behavior; gene sequence; in vivo study; Lai Sind cattle; lipid metabolism; male; Methanobacteriales; microbiome; nonhuman; pH; prediction; rumen microbiome; Anacardium; animal; animal food; diet; fermentation; genetics; metabolism; microflora; nut; rumen; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Fermentation; Methane; Microbiota; Nuts; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rumen","","methane, 74-82-8; propionic acid, 72-03-7, 79-09-4; Methane; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S","This work was implemented under the Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences project 'Climate Change Measures in Agricultural Systems' and supported by a grant‐in‐aid from MEXT, Japan (17H06105), to N.Y.","Beauchemin, Karen Anne Beauchemin, Use of condensed tannin extract from quebracho trees to reduce methane emissions from cattle, Journal of Animal Science, 85, 8, pp. 1990-1996, (2007); Beauchemin, Karen Anne Beauchemin, Methane abatement strategies for cattle: Lipid supplementation of diets, Canadian Journal of Animal Science, 87, 3, pp. 431-440, (2007); Bhatta, Raghavendra, Methane reduction and energy partitioning in goats fed two concentrations of tannin from Mimosa spp., Journal of Agricultural Science, 151, 1, pp. 119-128, (2013); Bilek, Rebecca S., Investigation of cattle methane production and emission over a 24-hour period using measurements of δ13C and δD of emitted CH4 and rumen water, Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, D14, pp. 15405-15413, (2001); Bokulich, Nicholas A., Optimizing taxonomic classification of marker-gene amplicon sequences with QIIME 2's q2-feature-classifier plugin, Microbiome, 6, 1, (2018); Bolyen, Evan, Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2, Nature Biotechnology, 37, 8, pp. 852-857, (2019); Callahan, Benjamin J., DADA2: High-resolution sample inference from Illumina amplicon data, Nature Methods, 13, 7, pp. 581-583, (2016); Caporaso, J.

By means of genetic engineering technology together with a bacterial expression system, the KL5 fusions of epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, and stromal cell-derived factor-1α were prepared together with their control counterparts without KL5. The adsorption experiments were performed for these fusion proteins on the surface of polystyrene, hydrophilized polystyrene, and polycaprolactone by surface plasmon resonance analysis. To understand the results of the binding assays, the structure of the fusion proteins was predicted by ab initio computer simulation and analyzed empirically by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The result of structural analyses suggested that the KL5 peptide is exposed to the outside and has a negligible effect on the structure of the protein partners. However, it was found that the efficiency of KL5 as a peptide motif greatly depends on protein partners. Our results showed that KL5 exerts most effectively its function as a peptide motif when fused to acidic proteins such as EGF. Indeed, the number of living human mesenchymal stem cells determined after 7-day culture was larger on the polystyrene and polycaprolactone surfaces with EGF tethered through the KL5 peptide than control surfaces. According to the results obtained in this study, we conclude that KL5 is useful as a peptide motif for tethering a specific class of protein partners. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioactive Surface; Fusion Protein; Genetic Engineering; Mesenchymal Stem Cell; Peptide Motif; Surface Modification; Epidermal Growth Factor; Polycaprolactone; Polystyrene; Protein; Epidermal Growth Factor; Peptides; Polymers; Polystyrenes; Cell Culture; Cell Engineering; Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy; Dichroism; Genetic Engineering; Plasmons; Polystyrenes; Stem Cells; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Acidic Proteins; Adsorption Experiment; Bacterial Expression Systems; Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor; Epidermal Growth Factors; Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Hydrophobic Amino Acids; Polymer Surfaces; Peptides; Epidermal Growth Factor; Fusion Protein; Kl5 Peptide; Peptide; Peptide Derivative; Polycaprolactone; Polymer; Polystyrene; Protein; Recombinant Protein; Unclassified Drug; Polystyrene Derivative; Ab Initio Calculation; Adsorption; Article; Binding Assay; Cell Proliferation; Circular Dichroism; Computer Simulation; Controlled Study; Drug Synthesis; Feasibility Study; Genetic Engineering; Human; Human Cell; Hydrophilicity; Mesenchymal Stem Cell; Priority Journal; Protein Analysis; Protein Function; Protein Motif; Protein Secondary Structure; Stem Cell Culture; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Computer Simulation; Epidermal Growth Factor; Humans; Polymers","Cell culture; Cell engineering; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Dichroism; Genetic engineering; Plasmons; Polystyrenes; Stem cells; Surface plasmon resonance; Acidic proteins; Adsorption experiment; Bacterial expression systems; Basic fibroblast growth factor; Epidermal growth factors; Human mesenchymal stem cells; Hydrophobic amino acids; Polymer surfaces; Peptides; epidermal growth factor; fusion protein; kl5 peptide; peptide; peptide derivative; polycaprolactone; polymer; polystyrene; protein; recombinant protein; unclassified drug; polystyrene derivative; ab initio calculation; adsorption; Article; binding assay; cell proliferation; circular dichroism; computer simulation; controlled study; drug synthesis; feasibility study; genetic engineering; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; mesenchymal stem cell; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; protein motif; protein secondary structure; stem cell culture; surface plasmon resonance; Computer Simulation; Epidermal Growth Factor; Humans; Polymers","","epidermal growth factor, 59459-45-9, 62229-50-9; polycaprolactone, 24980-41-4, 25248-42-4; polystyrene, 9003-53-6; protein, 67254-75-5; Epidermal Growth Factor; Peptides; Polymers; Polystyrenes","The part of this work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number JP25293403 and JP16H03182.","Indo Am J Pharm Res, (2018); Welch, Nicholas G., Orientation and characterization of immobilized antibodies for improved immunoassays (review), Biointerphases, 12, 2, (2017); Assal, Yasmine, Growth Factor Tethering to Protein Nanoparticles via Coiled-Coil Formation for Targeted Drug Delivery, Bioconjugate Chemistry, 26, 8, pp. 1672-1677, (2015); Kato, Koichi, Selective adsorption of proteins to their ligands covalently immobilized onto microfibers, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 47, 5, pp. 557-566, (1995); Ingavle, Ganesh C., Bioinspired detoxification of blood: The efficient removal of anthrax toxin protective antigen using an extracorporeal macroporous adsorbent devicearticle, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Kato, Koichi, Collagen immobilization onto the surface of artificial hair for improving the tissue adhesion, Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology, 14, 5, pp. 635-650, (2000); Egawa, Edgar Y., Enhanced proliferation of neural stem cells in a collagen hydrogel incorporating engineered epidermal growth factor, Biomaterials, 32, 21, pp. 4737-4743, (2011); Wang, Ting Yi, Characterization of the stability and bio-functionality of tethered proteins on bioengineered scaffolds: Implications for stem cell biology and tissue repair, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 289, 21, pp. 15044-15051, (2014); Meldal, Morten, Recent advances in covalent, site-specific protein immobilization., F1000Research, 5, (2016); Kato, Koichi, Immobilization of histidine-tagged recombinant proteins onto micropatterned surfaces for cell-based functional assays, Langmuir, 21, 16, pp. 7071-7075, (2005)","","Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.","","","","","","15685624; 09205063","","JBSEE","32867596","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090940523"

Co particle dispersion on MA was evidently improved after promoter incorporation, resulting in smaller crystallite size and lesser Co agglomeration. Unlike Ce and La promoters, the employment of Y and Sm promoters reduced catalyst reducibility by strengthening Co-MA interaction. The reactant conversions improved in the order of YCo/MA > LaCo/MA > CeCo/MA > SmCo/MA > Co/MA, while the amount of carbon deposit was recorded with the sequence of Co/MA > SmCo/MA > LaCo/MA > CeCo/MA > YCo/MA. Additionally, YCo/MA attained the highest activity (CH<inf>4</inf> conversion = 85.8%, CO<inf>2</inf> conversion = 92.2%) and possessed the lowest carbon deposition (7.02%) due to great Co dispersion, small Co particle size with strong Co-MA interaction and higher oxygen storage capacity.

Here, we explore the relationship between the elastic properties, thermal conductivity, and structure of In4Se3. The experimentally determined average sound velocity (2010 m·s-1), Young's modulus (47 GPa), and Debye temperature (198 K) of In4Se3 are rather low, indicating considerable lattice softening. This behavior, which is consistent with low thermal conductivity, can be related to the complex bonding found in this material, in which strong covalent In-In and In-Se bonds coexist with weaker electrostatic interactions. Phonon dispersion calculations show that Einstein-like modes occur at ≈30 cm-1. These Einstein-like modes can be ascribed to weakly bonded In+ cations located between strongly bonded [(In3)5+(Se2-)3]- layers. The Grüneisen parameter for the soft-bonded In+ at the frequencies of the Einstein-like modes is large, indicating a high degree of bond anharmonicity and hence increased phonon scattering. The calculated thermal conductivity and elastic properties are in good agreement with experimental results. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Grüneisen Parameter; Lattice Softening; Lone Pair; Thermal Conductivity; Thermoelectric Materials; Binary Alloys; Elastic Moduli; Elasticity; Phonons; Waste Heat; Waste Heat Utilization; Anharmonicities; Elastic Properties; Low Thermal Conductivity; Phonon Dispersions; Thermo-electric Materials; Thermal Conductivity","Binary alloys; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Phonons; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Anharmonicities; Elastic properties; Low thermal conductivity; Phonon dispersions; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermal conductivity","","","S.D.N.L. and K.T.W. thank the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Technology for hosting and financial support within the TEAM −TECH/2016-2/14 project of the Foundation for Polish Science, entitled “New approach for the development of efficient materials for direct conversion of heat into electricity project”, co-financed by the European Union under the European Regional Development Fund.

A series of Mn-doped RRs were prepared by an impregnation method for the catalytic oxidation of CO and/or p-xylene. Various techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen physisorption measurements, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the catalysts. XRD and XPS analysis confirmed the existence of Mn2O3 in the MnRR1 samples. The addition of Mn2O3 into RR led to a decrease in the surface area of RR from 25.6 m2 g-1 to 19.0-24.8 m2 g-1, pore volume from 0.018 cm3 g-1 to 0.013-0.017 cm3 g-1, and average pore diameter from 20.4 Å to 18.8-20.3 Å, suggesting that Mn2O3 can be deposited inside the pores of the material. Among these catalyst samples, 3MnRR1 prepared by 3.0 wt% Mn doped into RR showed the best performance for CO or p-xylene deep oxidation, achieving CO conversion of 100% at approximately 280 C and p-xylene conversion of 93% at 400 C. Meanwhile, the conversion of CO and p-xylene in a mixture was found to be much lower than that in a pure substance. An increase in the moisture content was found to lead to lower CO and p-xylene conversion. The obtained catalyst pellet used kaolin as a binder and showed a mechanical strength of 12.4 MPa and a low weight attrition rate of 1.8%. The result indicated that a pellet catalyst had a slightly lower catalytic activity than that in the powder catalyst for CO/p-xylene conversion at the investigated temperatures, the conversions of CO were approximately 98% at 320 C, and the conversion of p-xylene was 83.8% at 450 C, and remained almost stable during 50 h of testing. These results confirm that MnRR2 catalytic pellets are promising for industrial catalyst applications.

The results reveal the degradation in both NR and DPNR, and the DPNR was degraded easier than NR. The highest weight loss of 48.37% was obtained in the fourth enrichment consortium with DPNR, while 35.39% was obtained in the fifth enrichment consortium with NR after 14 days of incubation. Nitrogen content and fatty acid content determined by Kjeldahl method and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively, were decreased significantly after being incubated with the consortia. Structure of degraded rubber film analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed the presence of aldehyde group, a sign of rubber degradation. Bacterial cells tightly adhering and embedding into NR and DPNR films were observed by scanning electron microscopy. There were differences in the bacterial composition of the consortia with NR and DPNR, which were determined by metagenomic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria may play a role in the degradation of non-isoprene compounds such as protein or lipid, while the phylum Actinobacteria plays a crucial role in the degradation of rubber hydrocarbon in all consortia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial Consortium; Biodegradation; Deproteinized Natural Rubber; Natural Rubber; Rubber; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Rubber; Biodegradation; Fatty Acids; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Hydrocarbon Refining; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Rna; Rubber; Rubber Industry; Scanning Electron Microscopy; 16s Rrna Gene Sequencing; Bacterial Composition; Bacterial Consortium; Fatty Acid Contents; Kjeldahl Methods; Metagenomic Analysis; Rubber Hydrocarbon; Rubber Processing; Rubber Factories; Aldehyde; Bacterium; Biochemical Composition; Biodegradation; Fatty Acid; Genetic Analysis; Lipid; Protein; Rubber; Viet Nam; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria; Rna 16s; Bioremediation; Genetics; Infrared Spectroscopy; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared","Biodegradation; Fatty acids; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrocarbon refining; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; RNA; Rubber; Rubber industry; Scanning electron microscopy; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Bacterial composition; Bacterial consortium; Fatty acid contents; Kjeldahl methods; Metagenomic analysis; Rubber hydrocarbon; Rubber processing; Rubber factories; aldehyde; bacterium; biochemical composition; biodegradation; fatty acid; genetic analysis; lipid; protein; rubber; Viet Nam; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria; RNA 16S; bioremediation; genetics; infrared spectroscopy; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared","","rubber, 9006-04-6; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rubber","This research was funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant Number 106.04-2017.31.","Arenskötter, Matthias, Taxonomic characterization of two rubber degrading bacteria belonging to the species Gordonia polyisoprenivorans and analysis of hyper variable regions of 16S rDNA sequences, FEMS Microbiology Letters, 205, 2, pp. 277-282, (2001); Arenskötter, Matthias, Biology of the metabolically diverse genus Gordonia, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 70, 6, pp. 3195-3204, (2004); Atagana, Harrison Ifeanyichukwu, Bacteria associated with degradation of wastes from rubber processing industry, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 59, 2, pp. 145-154, (1999); Berekaa, Mahmoud Mohamed, Effect of pretreatment of rubber material on its biodegradability by various rubber degrading bacteria, FEMS Microbiology Letters, 184, 2, pp. 199-206, (2000); Berekaa, Mahmoud Mohamed, Microbial degradation of the multiply branched alkane 2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane (Squalane) by Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium ratisbonense, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 66, 10, pp. 4462-4467, (2000); Berkelmann, Dirk, Unravelling the effects of tropical land use conversion on the soil microbiome, Environmental Microbiome, 15, 1, (2020); Bode, Helge Björn, Bacterial degradation of natural and synthetic rubber, Biomacromolecules, 2, 1, pp. 295-303, (2001); Bosco, Francesca, Biodegradation of unvulcanized natural rubber by microorganisms isolated from soil and rubber surface: A preliminary study, Bioremediation Journal, 22, 1-2, pp. 62-71, (2018); Deng, Jiaojiao, Variations in soil bacterial community diversity and structures among different revegetation types in the Baishilazi nature reserve, Frontiers in Microbiology, 9, NOV, (2018); Polym Int, (1991)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","09239820; 15729729","","BIODE","32914250","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091388192"

This study explores a new separation method via applying microwave irradiation. Butanol/water droplet was monitored during exposure to microwave irradiation at different power rates. The surface tension, droplet volume, and temperature were scrutinized during and after exposure to microwave irradiation. The data obtained indicated that the microwave-induced evaporation rates of alcohols were much higher than that of water. Consequently, the vaporized phase contained a much higher alcohol content than the liquid phase. In particular, butanol concentration in the aqueous phase could be reduced to ~ 0.1 wt. %, which was more effective than the theoretical limit via the boiling process. The method is an attractive option to complement the fermentation process, which produces a low butanol concentration solution. This development could potentially lead to a more efficient pathway for biobutanol production. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1-butanol Separation; Economic Viability; Evaporation; Microwave; Surface Tension; Drops; Energy Utilization; Evaporation; Irradiation; Microwave Irradiation; Surface Tension; 'current; 1-butanol; 1-butanol Separation; Economic Viability; High Energy Consumption; Microwave- Irradiations; Power Rates; Selective Evaporations; Separation Methods; Water Droplets; Separation","Drops; Energy utilization; Evaporation; Irradiation; Microwave irradiation; Surface tension; 'current; 1-butanol; 1-butanol separation; Economic viability; High energy consumption; Microwave- irradiations; Power rates; Selective evaporations; Separation methods; Water droplets; Separation","","","The authors acknowledge Prof. Naoki Ono (Shibaura Institute of Technology) and Dr. Tuyen Pham (Newcastle University, Australia) for sharing their data.","Anderson, Thomas F., Application of the UNIQUAC Equation to Calculation of Multicomponent Phase Equilibria. 2.

In this study, in order to overcome the above shortcomings, a novel bench-scale suspension plant using a magnetorheological elastomer (MRE)-based absorber accompanied with an adaptive and global neural-network-based tracking controller is introduced. The adaptive neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the uncertain dynamics of the quarter-car model. The novel scheme consists of three parts, including a conventional ANN controller dominating the active region of neurons, a robust controller serving as a temporary controller to pull back the state into the active region when the neural approximation falls outside, and a switch to be used to monitor the activation of the neural part and switch the control authority between the above two controllers. The controller ensures that a globally uniform ultimate boundedness can be achieved. Furthermore, an auxiliary design system was added to the controller in order to deal with the effects of input constraints, and the state was analyzed for the tracking of the stabilization. The control scheme ensures that the output of the system converges to the vicinity of a reference trajectory and all the signals are globally, uniformly, and ultimately bounded. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively suppress the vibrations of the semiactive quarter car. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automobile Suspensions; Controllers; Elastomers; Model Automobiles; Neural Networks; Suspensions (components); Adaptive Neural Network Controller; Adaptive Neural Networks; Control Authorities; Magnetorheological Elastomers; Reference Trajectories; Semi Active Suspension; Stability And Tracking; Uniform Ultimate Boundedness; Adaptive Control Systems","Automobile suspensions; Controllers; Elastomers; Model automobiles; Neural networks; Suspensions (components); Adaptive neural network controller; Adaptive neural networks; Control authorities; Magnetorheological elastomers; Reference trajectories; Semi active suspension; Stability and tracking; Uniform ultimate boundedness; Adaptive control systems","","","Acknowledgements.

The fiber matrix is considered as an external field to reconfigure a nanoparticle assembly. We find that the heating process tunes particle-particle and fiber-particle interactions, which alter adsorption of nanoparticles on fiber surfaces or clustering in pore spaces. Thus, it is possible to control the nanoparticle self-assembly by laser illumination. Gold nanoparticles strongly absorb radiations and efficiently dissipate absorbed energy into heat. By solving the heat transfer equation associated with an effective medium approximation, we calculate the spatial temperature rise. Remarkably, our theoretical results quantitatively agree with prior experiments. This indicates that we can ignore plasmonic coupling effects induced by particle clustering.

This model is based on the model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology, in combination with the model-driven architecture (MDA), the real-time unified modeling language (UML)/systems modeling language (SysML), the extended/unscented Kalman filter (EKF/UKF) algorithms, and hybrid automata, and it can be reused for designing controllers of various AUV types. The dynamic model and control structure of AUVs were combined with the specialization of MDA concepts as follows. The computation-independent model (CIM) was specified by the use-case model combined with the EKF/UKF algorithms and hybrid automata to intensively gather the control requirements. Then, the platform-independent model (PIM) was specialized using the real-time UML/SysML to design the capsule collaboration of control and its connections. The detailed PIM was subsequently converted into the platform-specific model (PSM) using open-source platforms to promptly realize the AUV controller. On the basis of the proposed hybrid model, a planar trajectory-tracking controller, which allows a miniature torpedo-shaped AUV to autonomously track the desired planar trajectory, was implemented and evaluated, and shown to have good feasibility. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (auv); Auv Control; Extended/unscented Kalman Filter (ekf/ukf); Hybrid Automata; Model-based Systems Engineering (mbse); Model-driven Architecture (mda); Real-time Uml/sysml","","","","Funding text 1: Following the above-proposed model, a planar trajectory-tracking controller, which allowed a low-cost AUV possessing a torpedo shape to reach and follow a predetermined trajectory on the free surface, was deployed.

Here we report that one of the 12 barley PIPs (PIP1 and PIP2) tested, HvPIP2;8, facilitated cation transport when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. HvPIP2;8-associated ion currents were detected with Na+ and K+, but not Cs+, Rb+, or Li+, and was inhibited by Ba2+, Ca2+, and Cd2+ and to a lesser extent Mg2+, which also interacted with Ca2+. Currents were reduced in the presence of K+, Cs+, Rb+, or Li+ relative to Na+ alone. Five HvPIP1 isoforms co-expressed with HvPIP2;8 inhibited the ion conductance relative to HvPIP2;8 alone but HvPIP1;3 and HvPIP1;4 with HvPIP2;8 maintained the ion conductance at a lower level. HvPIP2;8 water permeability was similar to that of a C-terminal phosphorylation mimic mutant HvPIP2;8 S285D, but HvPIP2;8 S285D showed a negative linear correlation between water permeability and ion conductance that was modified by a kinase inhibitor treatment. HvPIP2;8 transcript abundance increased in barley shoot tissues following salt treatments in a salt-tolerant cultivar Haruna-Nijo, but not in salt-sensitive I743. There is potential for HvPIP2;8 to be involved in barley salt-stress responses, and HvPIP2;8 could facilitate both water and Na+/K+ transport activity, depending on the phosphorylation status. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aquaporins; Barley; Ion Transport; Oocytes; Plasma Membrane Intrinsic Proteins (pips); Aquaporin; Barium Ion; Cadmium; Calcium Ion; Cesium Ion; Lithium Ion; Magnesium Ion; Rubidium Ion; Sodium Chloride; Calcium; Potassium; Sodium; Water; Aquaporins; Calcium; Cations; Plant Proteins; Potassium; Rna, Complementary; Sodium; Water; Aquaporin; Barium Ion; Cadmium; Calcium Ion; Cesium Ion; Divalent Cation; Lithium Ion; Magnesium Ion; Plasma Membrane Intrinsic Protein; Plasma Protein; Rubidium Ion; Sodium Chloride; Unclassified Drug; Calcium; Cation; Complementary Rna; Plant Protein; Potassium; Sodium; Water; Adult; Animal Cell; Article; Barley; Carboxy Terminal Sequence; Cation Transport; Controlled Study; Cultivar; Electric Potential; Electrophysiology; Female; Gene; Hvpip2;8 Gene; Hydroponics; Ion Current; Ion Transport; Nonhuman; Oocyte; Potassium Conductance; Protein Phosphorylation; Salt Stress; Shoot; Sodium Conductance; Water Permeability; Water Transport; Xenopus Laevis; Animal; Cell Culture; Cell Membrane; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Hordeum; Metabolism; Patch Clamp Technique; Phosphorylation; Animals; Aquaporins; Calcium; Cations; Cell Membrane; Cells, Cultured; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ion Transport; Oocytes; Patch-clamp Techniques; Phosphorylation; Plant Proteins; Plant Shoots; Potassium; Rna, Complementary; Sodium; Water","aquaporin; barium ion; cadmium; calcium ion; cesium ion; divalent cation; lithium ion; magnesium ion; plasma membrane intrinsic protein; plasma protein; rubidium ion; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; calcium; cation; complementary RNA; plant protein; potassium; sodium; water; adult; animal cell; Article; barley; carboxy terminal sequence; cation transport; controlled study; cultivar; electric potential; electrophysiology; female; gene; hvpip2;8 gene; hydroponics; ion current; ion transport; nonhuman; oocyte; potassium conductance; protein phosphorylation; salt stress; shoot; sodium conductance; water permeability; water transport; Xenopus laevis; animal; cell culture; cell membrane; gene expression regulation; genetics; Hordeum; metabolism; patch clamp technique; phosphorylation; Animals; Aquaporins; Calcium; Cations; Cell Membrane; Cells, Cultured; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ion Transport; Oocytes; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Phosphorylation; Plant Proteins; Plant Shoots; Potassium; RNA, Complementary; Sodium; Water","","aquaporin, 215587-75-0; barium ion, 22541-12-4; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; calcium ion, 14127-61-8; cesium ion, 18459-37-5; lithium ion, 17341-24-1; magnesium ion, 22537-22-0; rubidium ion, 22537-38-8; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; water, 7732-18-5; Aquaporins; Calcium; Cations; Plant Proteins; Potassium; RNA, Complementary; Sodium; Water","Funding text 1: This research was founded by Ohara Foundation for Agricultural Science, (to M.K.), and by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as part of the Joint Research Program implemented at the Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University in Japan (2918, 3019, 3118, R220 to T.H.), and the MEXT scholarship (Research Student, to STH.T. and S.I.).

In 1-step heating, slow heating enhanced the gel strength of high-grade surimi more effectively than that of low-grade surimi. The quality of gels prepared by water bath and ohmic heating differed even if the heating time to the final temperature was the same, probably due to differences in the linear and non-linear temperature patterns of the two heating methods. The results of gels formed by 2-step heating and those with suppressed setting by EDTA confirmed that a slow heating rate enhanced gel strength by altering the setting phenomenon, but was also influenced by the modori effect, and the degree of enhancement differed depending on the surimi grade. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Edta; Heating Rate; Modori; Ohmic Heating; Setting; Surimi; Gels; Heating Rate; Final Temperatures; Gel Strengths; Heating Method; Heating Time; Slow Heating; Slow Heating Rates; Textural Properties; Water Baths; Heating","Gels; Heating rate; Final temperatures; Gel strengths; Heating method; Heating time; Slow heating; Slow heating rates; Textural properties; Water baths; Heating","","","","Official Methods of Analysis, (1990); Benjakul, Soottawat, Transglutaminase-mediated setting in bigeye snapper Surimi, Food Research International, 36, 3, pp. 253-266, (2003); Castro, Inês Alexandra, Ohmic heating of strawberry products: Electrical conductivity measurements and ascorbic acid degradation kinetics, Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies, 5, 1, pp. 27-36, (2004); Chanarat, Sochaya, Effect of formaldehyde on protein cross-linking and gel forming ability of surimi from lizardfish induced by microbial transglutaminase, Food Hydrocolloids, 30, 2, pp. 704-711, (2013); de Alwis, Ajith A.P., The use of direct resistance heating in the food industry, Journal of Food Engineering, 11, 1, pp. 3-27, (1990); Gilleland, G.

As-synthesized heterostructured catalyst was placed in a sono-reactor (40 kHz and 300 W) in order to degrade TYL through the sonocatalysis. 15 wt% WS<inf>2</inf>/CeO<inf>2</inf> was chosen for performing the systematic experiments. Decreasing the concentration of TYL, along with increasing the WS<inf>2</inf>/CeO<inf>2</inf> dosage led to reduced degradation efficiency. The water hardness was demonstrated to be a suppressive agent on the sonocatalysis of the target pollutant. As-generated holes, [rad]OH, and also O<inf>2</inf> [rad]− were responsible for the degradation of TYL. Increasing the ultrasound power and operating temperature enhanced the degradation efficiency. The degradation rate boosted up when the temperature was raised from 10 °C (0.0107 1/min) to 40 °C (0.0165 1/min). Moreover, the lowest activation energy (E<inf>a</inf>) for sonocatalytic degradation was obtained as 10.81 kJ/mol. The sonocatalytic activity of WS<inf>2</inf>/CeO<inf>2</inf> in the sono-reactor encountered insignificant change within five consecutive operational runs (~15% reduction).

The sorbents were characterized by N2 physisorption, elemental analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The effects of amine blending on the CO2 uptake, working capacity, and heat of adsorption were investigated and discussed. The experimental results showed that the heat of adsorption decreased with increasing DEA-to-TEPA ratios, but the CO2 uptake improved by the blending of TEPA and DEA. Furthermore, the DEA/TEPA blend considerably improved the regeneration properties of the sorbents. Mesocellular silica foam loaded with a mixture of 40 wt % TEPA and 30 wt % DEA exhibited a CO2 adsorption uptake of 5.91 mmol/g at 50 °C and 100 kPa with a heat of adsorption of 80 kJ/mol.

In situ infrared spectroscopy investigations revealed that CO2 adsorption occurred predominantly through the formation of carbamate species for both TEPA and DEA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan for financial support.

Two different orientations of dimethylammonium (DMA+) cations in VNU-15 were investigated. Antiferromagnetic configurations were predicted to be the ground states, with Fe ions in high-spin states for both phases. Furthermore, VNU-15 had intrinsic semiconductor electronic behavior with a small band gap of about 1.20 eV. The change in the orientation of DMA+led to changes in the dispersion of the band structure, the band gap, and the Fe contributions to the valence band and conduction band. A fascinating feature was found involving exchange of oxidation numbers between two adjacent Fe atoms in the two phases. Our results revealed that VNU-15 has strong oxidation activity and predicted the important role of an anisotropic effect on the hole and electron effective masses.

The wing has a peculiar shape reminiscent of a bird feather, often found in the smallest insects. Aerodynamic force coefficients are determined from a dynamically scaled force measurement experiment with rotating bristled and membrane wing models in a glycerin tank. Subsequently, they are used as numerical validation data for computational fluid dynamics simulations using an adaptive Navier–Stokes solver. The latter provides access to important flow properties such as leakiness and permeability. It is found that, in the considered biologically relevant regimes, the bristled wing functions as a less than 50 % leaky paddle, and it produces between 66 and 96 % of the aerodynamic drag force of an equivalent membrane wing. The discrepancy increases with increasing Reynolds number. It is shown that about half of the aerodynamic normal force exerted on a bristled wing is due to viscous shear stress. The paddling effectiveness factor is proposed as a measure of aerodynamic efficiency.

The focus was placed on treatment performance, removal mechanisms and lifespan of the HSSF-CWs. Results indicated that WHC-based HSSF-CW with P. atratum exhibited a high P removal (89.9%). The mean P efluent concentration and P removal rate were 1.34 ± 0.95 mg/L and 0.32 ± 0.03 g/m2/d, respectively. The mass balance study showed that media sorption was the dominant P removal pathway (77.5%), followed by microbial assimilation (14.5%), plant uptake (5.4%), and other processes (2.6%). It was estimated the WHC-based bed could work effectively for approximately 2.84 years. This WHC-based HSSF-CWs technology will therefore pave the way for recycling Ca-rich waste materials as media in HSSF-CWs to enhance P-rich wastewater purification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobically Digested Swine Wastewater; Ca-rich Materials; Lifespan; Phosphorus Removal Efficiency; Removal Pathways; Calcium; Phosphorus; Phosphorus; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Molluscs; Phosphorus; Wastewater Reclamation; Mass Balance; Phosphorus Removal; Plant Uptake; Removal Mechanism; Subsurface Flow; Swine Wastewater; Treatment Performance; Wastewater Purification; Wetlands; Calcium; Phosphorus; Concentration (composition); Constructed Wetland; Performance Assessment; Pollutant Removal; Purification; Subsurface Flow; Wastewater Treatment; Article; Clam; Effluent; Meretrix Lyrata; Nonhuman; Paspalum; Paspalum Atratum; Pig; Priority Journal; Waste Water; Waste Water Management; Animal; Bivalve; Longevity; Sewage; Water Pollutant; Wetland; Bivalvia; Suidae; Animals; Longevity; Swine; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Molluscs; Phosphorus; Wastewater reclamation; Mass balance; Phosphorus removal; Plant uptake; Removal mechanism; Subsurface Flow; Swine wastewater; Treatment performance; Wastewater purification; Wetlands; calcium; phosphorus; concentration (composition); constructed wetland; performance assessment; pollutant removal; purification; subsurface flow; wastewater treatment; Article; clam; effluent; Meretrix lyrata; nonhuman; Paspalum; Paspalum atratum; pig; priority journal; waste water; waste water management; animal; bivalve; longevity; sewage; water pollutant; wetland; Bivalvia; Suidae; Animals; Longevity; Swine; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Phosphorus; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [grant number 105.99-2018.13, 2018], and Asia Research Center, Vietnam National University, Hanoi (ARC-VNU) and Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS) [grant number CA.18.11A, 2018].

Herein, a composite of graphene decorated with manganese oxide nanoparticles was prepared via PE3P from a KMnO4 solution and graphite electrode under a voltage of 70 V in an ambient environment. By controlling the initial KMnO4 concentration, we obtained distinct MnO2/graphene samples. The prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical measurements of the MnO2/graphene composites revealed that the specific capacitance of the samples is approximately 320 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1, which is comparably very high for manganese oxide/carbon-based supercapacitor electrode materials. Considering the simple, low-cost, one-step and environmentally friendly preparation, our approach has the potential to be used for the fabrication of MnO2/graphene composites as the electrode materials of supercapacitors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Composite; Electrochemistry; Graphene; Manganese Oxide; Plasma; Supercapacitor; Capacitance; Exfoliation (materials Science); Graphite Electrodes; Green Manufacturing; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Manganese Oxide; Oxides; Potash; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Supercapacitor; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Ambient Environment; Electrochemical Measurements; Electrode Material; Exfoliation Process; Oxide Nanoparticles; Scanning Electrons; Specific Capacitance; Supercapacitor Electrodes; Electrochemical Electrodes","Capacitance; Exfoliation (materials science); Graphite electrodes; Green manufacturing; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Manganese oxide; Oxides; Potash; Scanning electron microscopy; Supercapacitor; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Ambient environment; Electrochemical measurements; Electrode material; Exfoliation process; Oxide nanoparticles; Scanning electrons; Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor electrodes; Electrochemical electrodes","","","","Geim, Andre K., The rise of graphene, Nature Materials, 6, 3, pp. 183-191, (2007); Chen, Jianhao, Intrinsic and extrinsic performance limits of graphene devices on SiO 2, Nature Nanotechnology, 3, 4, pp. 206-209, (2008); Lee, Changgu, Measurement of the elastic properties and intrinsic strength of monolayer graphene, Science, 321, 5887, pp. 385-388, (2008); Balandin, Alexander A., Superior thermal conductivity of single-layer graphene, Nano Letters, 8, 3, pp. 902-907, (2008); Rao, Chintamani Nagesa Ramachandra, Graphene: The new two-dimensional nanomaterial, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 48, 42, pp. 7752-7777, (2009); Novoselov, Konstantin Sergeevich, A roadmap for graphene, Nature, 490, 7419, pp. 192-200, (2012); Barabás, Réka, Comparative study on physicochemical and mechanical characterization of new nanocarbon-based hydroxyapatite nanocomposites, Turkish Journal of Chemistry, 43, 3, pp. 809-824, (2019); Dang, Minh Nhat, Plasma-assisted preparation of MoS2/Graphene/MOF hybrid materials and their electrochemical behaviours, Materials Transactions, 61, 8, pp. 1535-1539, (2020); Horn, Michael R., Graphene-based supercapacitor electrodes: Addressing challenges in mechanisms and materials, Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry, 17, pp. 42-48, (2019); Wei, Weifeng, Manganese oxide-based materials as electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes, Chemical Society Reviews, 40, 3, pp. 1697-1721, (2011)","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","","","","","09574484; 13616528","9780080964478","NNOTE","32365336","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086523167"

However, the multiple intermediates of the reaction make the catalyst design challenging. We engineered an active and selective catalyst with an active interface between Au-Pd alloy nanoparticles (NPs) and cobalt oxide supports via calcination of a composite of NPs encapsulated in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The catalyst shows an effective HMF-to-FDCA oxidation with total conversion and 95 % yield by 10 % hydrogen peroxide solution at 90 °C in one hour under atmospheric pressure. The mechanistic study shows that the engineered interface promotes the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals and dioxygen molecules, which accelerate the oxidation of reactive intermediates to FDCA.

We identified 66 shallow landslide locations, based on field surveys, by recording the locations of the landslides by a global position System (GPS), Google Earth imagery and black-and-white aerial photographs (scale 1: 20,000) and 19 landslide conditioning factors, then tested these factors using the information gain ratio (IGR) technique. We checked the validity of the models using statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We found that, although all three machine learning algorithms yielded excellent performance, the SVM algorithm (AUC = 0.984) slightly outperformed the BLR (AUC = 0.980), and ADTree (AUC = 0.977) algorithms. We observed that not only all three algorithms are useful and effective tools for identifying shallow landslide-prone areas but also the BLR algorithm can be used such as the SVM algorithm as a soft computing benchmark algorithm to check the performance of the models in future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Logistic Regression; Goodness-of-fit; Iran; Kurdistan; Machine Learning; Shallow Landslides; Support Vector Machine","","","","Funding: This research was supported by the University of Kurdistan, Iran, based on grant number GRC98-04469-1.

Perfect absorption and anti-reflection of wet hanging PANi-cotton fabrics cause quick transfer of total incident light into water confining nearly 100% of the sunlight. As a result, a hanging membrane is found to have more attractive properties than a floating above water fabric. We find, however, that the photothermal properties of a floating PANi-cotton membrane can greatly be enhanced by dispersing TiN nanoparticles in the water below the fabric. The calculated temperature gradients for TiN nanoparticle solutions show that the absorbed energy grows with increasing the nanoparticle density and that the photothermal process occurs mostly near the surface. The collective heating effects depend on the size and density of nanoparticles, which can further be used to modulate the photothermal process.

By considering various metal firing angles, a strong interaction between the Fe/Ni atom and the MoS2 surface can be observed because of enormous increase in the kinetic energy of the metal atom. When firing along the Mo-S bond, the Fe bullet is pulled more strongly than when firing along the S-Mo-S bisector. Spin polarization of MoS2 is gradually induced when Fe approaches the surface and eliminated when Fe roams around a potential energy trap on the MoS2 layer. We observe that there is charge transfer between Fe and Mo atoms, which enhances the probability of electron pairing and leads to instantaneous vanishing of total magnetization. The Ni-MoS2 system is found to establish a total magnetization of 1.5-4 μB when Ni is 2.0 Å above the surface.

The main requirements for the designed model are that it should reduce the harmful effects of solar radiation on human health, should be compact for storage, and not collapse in the wind. To demonstrate the optical and mechanical properties of the designed model, the developed recursive ray tracing algorithm is used to simulate the propagation of light rays through the designed paper origami-based structure and the numerical simulations are performed using the commercial software ANSYS and LS-DYNA to study the behavior of the designed origami-based structure under lateral forces as well as its folding behavior.

State-of-the-art solutions for short text classification obtained remarkable results by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, implementing such models requires choices, usually based on subjective experience, or on rare works comparing different settings for general text classification, while peculiar solutions should be individuated for QC task, depending on language and on dataset size. Therefore, this work aims at suggesting best practices for QC using CNNs. Different datasets were employed: (i) A multilingual set of labelled questions to evaluate the dependence of optimal settings on language; (ii) a large, widely used dataset for validation and comparison. Numerous experiments were executed, to perform a multivariate analysis, for evaluating statistical significance and influence on QC performance of all the factors (regarding text representation, architectural characteristics, and learning hyperparameters) and some of their interactions, and for finding the most appropriate strategies for QC. Results show the influence of CNN settings on performance. Optimal settings were found depending on language.

We aim to classify brain tumors using MRI images, which were collected from anonymous patients and artificial brain simulators. In this article, we carry out a comparative study between Simple Artificial Neural Networks with dropout, Basic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks. The experimental results shed light on the high classification performance (accuracy 97%) of Dilated CNN. On the other hand, Dilated CNN suffers from the gridding phenomenon. An incremental, even number dilation rate takes advantage of the reduced computational overhead and also overcomes the adverse effects of gridding. Comparative analysis between different combinations of dilation rates for the different convolution layers, help validate the results. The computational overhead in terms of efficiency for training the model to reach an acceptable threshold accuracy of 90% is another parameter to compare the model performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain Tumor; Classification; Convolutional; Deep Learning; Dilation","","","","","Dai, Yuxiang, Compressed sensing MRI via a multi-scale dilated residual convolution network, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 63, pp. 93-104, (2019); Lin, Guimin, Image super-resolution using a dilated convolutional neural network, Neurocomputing, 275, pp. 1219-1230, (2018); Future Computing and Informatics Journal, (2018); Afshar, Parnian, Brain Tumor Type Classification via Capsule Networks, Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, pp. 3129-3133, (2018); Lakshmanaprabu, S.

The SBK production process was developed in keeping with the conditions of the available technologies and investment while leveraging the advantage of an abundant national feedstock resource that is found in Indonesia in particular, and tropical emerging countries in general. The production of SBK comprises two main processes: saponification and thermal decarboxylation to convert coconut oil into hydrocarbons. The composition of SBK was analyzed and compared to that of Jet A1. Additionally, the critical properties of SBK and several of its blends with Jet A1 were measured and collated with the established jet fuel standard. The results show that SBK can be blended directly with Jet A1 at up to 10 vol.% to meet selected properties: distillation temperature, flash point, density, net heating value, viscosity, freezing point, smoke point, and oxidation stability. From this study, it can be concluded that SBK is feasible for use as a drop-in aviation fuel when blended with conventional jet fuel. Thus, the SBK production is highly promising for use in tropical countries to produce aviation biofuels, given the appropriate technologies and feedstock resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aviation Alternative Fuel; Aviation Biofuel; Decarboxylation; Saponification; Soap-derived Biokerosene; Alternative Fuels; Carboxylation; Distillation; Feedstocks; Hydrocarbons; Jet Fuel; Smoke; Tropics; Appropriate Technologies; Critical Properties; Distillation Temperature; Emerging Countries; Feedstock Resources; Oxidation Stability; Thermal Decarboxylation; Tropical Countries; Petroleum Industry","Alternative fuels; Carboxylation; Distillation; Feedstocks; Hydrocarbons; Jet fuel; Smoke; Tropics; Appropriate technologies; Critical properties; Distillation temperature; Emerging countries; Feedstock resources; Oxidation stability; Thermal decarboxylation; Tropical countries; Petroleum industry","","","We gratefully acknowledge the ASEAN University Network Southeast Asian Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net) project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for their financial support.

In this work, the revealing properties of metal (Na/Mg/Al)-adsorbed graphene systems are investigated by means of the first-principles method. The single- A nd double-sided chemisorption cases, the various adatom concentrations, the hollow/top/valley/bridge sites, and the buckled structures are taken into account. The hollow and valley adsorptions that correspond to the Na/Mg and Al cases, respectively, create extremely nonuniform environments. This leads to diverse orbital hybridizations in Na/Mg/Al-Si bonds, as indicated by the Na/Mg/Al-dominated bands, as well as the spatial charge density distributions and the orbital-projected density of states (DOS). Out of three types of metal-adatom adsorptions, the Al-adsorption configurations produce the strongest chemical modifications. The ferromagnetic configurations have been shown to survive only in specific Mg and Al adsorptions, but not in the Na cases. The presented theoretical predictions could be verified experimentally, and potential applications are discussed.

In clinical application, calcite nano-particle has to be useful for recovering the surface of tooth. The surface of tooth was often damaged due to wrong tooth care treatment, dental caries and periodontal disease. Because of tooth surface destruction, it could lead to dental hypersensitivity. It is desirable to find a suitable source for supplying calcium to fill in dentinal tubules and later regenerate the tooth surface. This study demonstrated the synthesis and characterization of calcite nanoparticle for its application in dental hypersensitivity treatment. Cockleshell was found to be a suitable source to synthesize calcite. Using cockleshell as raw materials to produce calcite nanoparticle is meaningful for both environmental protection and biomedical application. Therefore, in this study, calcite nano-particle was synthesized using cockleshell as a reproducibility source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and chitosan as a size-reducing agent. Xray Diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize phase composition of raw materials, as-prepared powder and calcined powder.

Nowadays, one of the innovated technologies applied to bond nonwoven fabrics is the ultrasonic welding method, due to the advantages afforded by its clean, fast, and reliable approach. In this work, isotactic polypropylene (PP) nonwoven fabrics were bonded by a continuous ultrasonic welding process. In order to consider the influence of the roller on the formation of welding joints and their mechanical properties, different roller profiles were designed, fabricated, and tested. Eight types of roller profiles corresponding to No. 1-No. 8 in the experiments were divided into four groups. After bonding, the microstructure in a typical case (i.e., No. 1) was captured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the formation of the welding joints. Additionally, the load and the peel strength of the welding joints of all eight roller profiles were analyzed. The results showed that no welding defects, such as cracks or blowholes, were visible in the melted zone. The load depended on the area ratio(s) of the welding area (S<inf>0</inf>) to the cycling area (S<inf>1</inf>). Furthermore, it was found out that the peel strength of the welding joints with brick structures were higher than the peel strength in the case of solid line structures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Microstructure; Nonwoven Fabric; Peel Strength; Roller; Ultrasonic Welding","","","","Funding: This research was funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2019-20-08.","Lim, Hosun, A review of spun bond process, Journal of Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management, 6, 3, pp. 1-13, (2010); Nanjundappa, Rammohan, Effect of processing conditions on the structure and properties of polypropylene spunbond fabrics, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 98, 6, pp. 2355-2364, (2005); Kayar, Mahmut, Analysis of ultrasonic seam tensile properties of thermal bonded nonwoven fabrics, Journal of Engineered Fibers and Fabrics, 9, 3, pp. 8-18, (2014); Chand, Subhash, Structure and properties of polypropylene fibers during thermal bonding, Thermochimica Acta, 367-368, pp. 155-160, (2001); Bhat, Gajanan S., Thermal bonding of polypropylene nonwovens: Effect of bonding variables on the structure and properties of the fabrics, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 92, 6, pp. 3593-3600, (2004); Strength Optimization of Thermally Bonded Spunbond Nonwovens, 2, 1; Warner, Steven B., Thermal Bonding of Polypropylene Fibers, Textile Research Journal, 59, 3, pp. 151-159, (1989); Spring Sci Busi Media, (1997); Limem, Skander, Adhesive Point-Bonded Spunbond Fabrics, Textile Research Journal, 75, 1, pp. 63-72, (2005); International Nonwovens Journal, (2001)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087626525"

However, its role in peripheral organs is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the function of SerT in the development of the compound eye in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that SerT knockdown led to excessive cell death and an increased number of cells in S-phase in the posterior eye imaginal disc. Furthermore, the knockdown of SerT in the eye disc suppressed the activation of Akt, and the introduction of PI3K effectively rescued this phenotype. These results suggested that SerT plays a role in the healthy eye development of D. melanogaster by controlling cell death through the regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cell Death; Drosophila; Eye Development; Pi3k/akt Pathway; Serotonin Transporter; Caspase 3; Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase; Protein Kinase B; Caspase; Biomarkers; Caspases; Drosophila Proteins; Proto-oncogene Proteins C-akt; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Sert Protein, Drosophila; Caspase 3; Neurotransmitter Transporter; Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase; Protein Kinase B; Protein P35; Transcription Factor Gal4; Biological Marker; Caspase; Drosophila Protein; Serotonin Transporter; Sert Protein, Drosophila; Adult; Article; Cell Cycle S Phase; Cell Death; Controlled Study; Diap1 Gene; Drosophila Melanogaster; Enzyme Activation; Eye Development; Gene; Gene Knockdown; Immunohistochemistry; Inverted Repeat; Male; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Pi3k/akt Signaling; Protein Expression; Rna Interference; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Animal; Apoptosis; Embryology; Eye; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Metabolism; Organogenesis; Signal Transduction; Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers; Caspases; Drosophila Proteins; Eye; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Organogenesis; Phenotype; Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases; Proto-oncogene Proteins C-akt; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Signal Transduction","caspase 3; neurotransmitter transporter; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein p35; transcription factor GAL4; biological marker; caspase; Drosophila protein; serotonin transporter; SerT protein, Drosophila; adult; Article; cell cycle S phase; cell death; controlled study; diap1 gene; Drosophila melanogaster; enzyme activation; eye development; gene; gene knockdown; immunohistochemistry; inverted repeat; male; nonhuman; phenotype; Pi3K/Akt signaling; protein expression; RNA interference; scanning electron microscopy; animal; apoptosis; embryology; eye; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; organogenesis; signal transduction; Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers; Caspases; Drosophila Proteins; Eye; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Organogenesis; Phenotype; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Signal Transduction","","caspase 3, 169592-56-7; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; protein kinase B, 148640-14-6; caspase, 186322-81-6; Biomarkers; Caspases; Drosophila Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; SerT protein, Drosophila","Author Contributions: Conceptualization, T.L.A.P., and K.K.; methodology, T.L.A.P., T.D.B., G.L., and R.S.; writing—original draft preparation, T.L.A.P.; writing—review and editing, T.D.B., K.K., T.Q.C.N., Y.D.H.N., T.T.M.; supervision, K.K.

This study describes the first application of the Hyperpipes (HP) algorithm for the development of the five novel ensemble models that combine the HP algorithm and the AdaBoost (AB), Bagging (B), Dagging, Decorate, and Real AdaBoost (RAB) ensemble techniques for mapping the spatial variability of landslide susceptibility in the Nam Dan commune, Ha Giang province, Vietnam. Information on 76 historical landslides and ten geo-environmental factors (slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index, curvature, weathering crust, geology, river density, fault density, and distance from roads) were used for the construction of the training and validation datasets that are the prerequisites for building and testing the proposed models. Using different performance metrics (i.e., the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), negative predictive value, positive predictive value, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, root mean square error, and Kappa), we verified the proficiency of all five ensemble learning techniques in increasing the fitness and predictive powers of the base HP model. Based on the AUC values derived from the models, the ensemble ABHP model that yielded an AUC value of 0.922 was identified as the most efficient model for mapping the landslide susceptibility in the Nam Dan commune, followed by RABHP (AUC = 0.919), BHP (AUC = 0.909), Dagging-HP (AUC = 0.897), Decorate-HP (AUC = 0.865), and the single HP model (AUC = 0.856), respectively. The novel ensemble models proposed for the Nam Dan commune and the resultant susceptibility maps can aid land-use planners in the development of efficient mitigation strategies in response to destructive landslides. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaboost; Bagging; Dagging; Decorate; Ensemble Modeling; Machine Learning; Real Adaboost","","","","Funding text 1: This study was conducted within the implementation of research project VT-UD.05/18-20 funded by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST).

In this study, the contributing behavior of the oil/water interaction to the oil recovery process was investigated through core- A nd microscale experiments involving high-polar-component oil. Two tertiary coreflood experiments with high- A nd low-salinity water were conducted using cores from the same reservoir formation, where the behavior of oil recovery and that of differential pressure differed significantly. The results of core and water analyses indicate that the emulsions predominantly caused this difference. Thus, microfluidic experiments were conducted to visualize the emulsion-based oil recovery mechanisms; two phenomena of emulsions contributed to oil recovery: Pore blockage and microwater dispersion. In addition, we studied the stability of emulsions in terms of the surface electric charge through the use of ζ potential measurements; emulsions were more stable in the lower salinity and higher pH conditions. These experimental results demonstrate that emulsions are important during LSWF for additional oil recovery in water-wet porous media. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emulsification; Oil Well Flooding; Ostwald Ripening; Porous Materials; Secondary Recovery; Coreflood Experiments; Differential Pressures; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Oil Recovery Mechanisms; Oil Recovery Process; Reservoir Formation; Surface Electric Charge; Zeta Potential Measurements; Enhanced Recovery","Emulsification; Oil well flooding; Ostwald ripening; Porous materials; Secondary recovery; Coreflood experiments; Differential pressures; Enhanced oil recovery; Oil recovery mechanisms; Oil recovery process; Reservoir formation; Surface electric charge; Zeta potential measurements; Enhanced recovery","","","","Robbana, Enis, Low salinity enhanced oil recovery - Laboratory to day one field implementation - LoSal EOR into the Clair Ridge Project, 4, pp. 2582-2596, (2012); Awolayo, Adedapo Noah, Brine-dependent recovery processes in carbonate and sandstone petroleum reservoirs: Review of laboratory-field studies, interfacial mechanisms and modeling attempts, Energies, 11, 11, (2018); SPE California Regional Meeting, (1967); Tang, Guoqing, Influence of brine composition and fines migration on crude oil/brine/rock interactions and oil recovery, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 24, 2-4, pp. 99-111, (1999); McGuire, Patrick L., Low salinity oil recovery: An exciting new EOR opportunity for Alaska's north slope, pp. 439-453, (2005); RezaeiDoust, Alireza R., Smart water as wettability modifier in carbonate and sandstone: A discussion of similarities/differences in the chemical mechanisms, Energy and Fuels, 23, 9, pp. 4479-4485, (2009); Lager, Arnaud, Low salinity oil recovery - An experimental investigation, Petrophysics, 49, 1, pp. 28-35, (2008); Austad, Tor A., Chemical mechanism of low salinity water flooding in sandstone reservoirs, Proceedings - SPE Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery, 1, pp. 679-695, (2010); Ligthelm, Dick J., Novel waterflooding strategy by manipulation of injection brine composition (SPE-119835), 2, pp. 1313-1335, (2009); Emadi, Alireza, Visual investigation of oil recovery by low salinity water injection: Formation of water micro-dispersions and wettability alteration, SPE Annual Technical Conference Proceedings, 6, pp. 4168-4182, (2013)","","American Chemical Society service@acs.org","","","","","","15205029; 08870624","","ENFUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081324358"

In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activities of L. spinosa leaf extract in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. We found that ethanol extracts of L. spinosa leaves showed anti-oxidant activity due to the presence of high levels of polyphenolic compounds. Treatment with the leaf extract significantly repressed the production of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, L. spinosa leaf extract treatment prevented activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway by inhibiting nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IBff) degradation. Furthermore, the mitogen-activated kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathways were suppressed upon treatment with the leaf extract. In addition to suppressing inflammatory factors, the extract also activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme-oxygenase-1 pathway. We propose that L. spinosa leaf extract has the potential as an effective therapeutic agent for alleviating oxidative stress and excessive inflammation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-inflammatory; Anti-oxidant; Inflammatory Cytokines; Lasia Spinosa; Macrophages; Ascorbic Acid; Gallic Acid; Glyceraldehyde 3 Phosphate Dehydrogenase; I Kappa B Kinase Alpha; Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactate Dehydrogenase A; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 3; N(g) Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase; Protein Kinase B; Stress Activated Protein Kinase; Trolox C; Lipopolysaccharides; Nf-kappa B; Plant Extracts; Antiinflammatory Agent; Antioxidant; Ascorbic Acid; Cyclooxygenase 2; Gallic Acid; Glyceraldehyde 3 Phosphate Dehydrogenase; I Kappa B Kinase Alpha; Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Protein; Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase; Interleukin 10; Interleukin 1beta; Interleukin 6; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lasia Spinosa Leaf Extract; Lipopolysaccharide; Messenger Rna; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 3; N(g) Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase; Plant Extract; Polyphenol Derivative; Protein Kinase B; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Stress Activated Protein Kinase; Transcription Factor Rela; Trolox C; Tumor Necrosis Factor; Unclassified Drug; Animal Cell; Antiinflammatory Activity; Antioxidant Activity; Article; Cell Structure; Cell Survival; Cell Viability; Controlled Study; Cytokine Release; Enzymatic Degradation; Enzyme Phosphorylation; Immune Response; Inflammation; Lasia Spinosa; Medicinal Plant; Mrna Expression Level; Nonhuman; Oxidative Stress; Pi3k/akt Signaling; Plant Leaf; Raw 264.7 Cell Line; Animal; Araceae; Chemistry; Drug Effect; Genetics; Human; Macrophage; Mouse; Pathology; Signal Transduction; Animals; Humans; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharides; Macrophages; Mice; Nf-kappa B; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Raw 264.7 Cells; Signal Transduction","antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; cyclooxygenase 2; gallic acid; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; Lasia spinosa leaf extract; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester; nitric oxide; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; plant extract; polyphenol derivative; protein kinase B; reactive oxygen metabolite; stress activated protein kinase; transcription factor RelA; trolox C; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; animal cell; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; cell structure; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; cytokine release; enzymatic degradation; enzyme phosphorylation; immune response; inflammation; Lasia spinosa; medicinal plant; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Pi3K/Akt signaling; plant leaf; RAW 264.7 cell line; animal; Araceae; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; human; macrophage; mouse; pathology; signal transduction; Animals; Humans; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharides; Macrophages; Mice; NF-kappa B; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; RAW 264.7 Cells; Signal Transduction","","ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; gallic acid, 149-91-7; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, 9001-50-7; I kappa B kinase alpha, 151217-48-0; inducible nitric oxide synthase, 501433-35-8; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; mitogen activated protein kinase 1, 137632-08-7; mitogen activated protein kinase 3, 137632-07-6; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester, 50903-99-6; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; protein kinase B, 148640-14-6; stress activated protein kinase, 155215-87-5; trolox C, 56305-04-5; Lipopolysaccharides; NF-kappa B; Plant Extracts","Funding: This work was partially supported by Grants-in-Aid from the JSPS Core-to-Core Program, B.

To address this issue, the convection flow on the top surface of weld pool was observed using a high-speed video camera. The temperature distribution on the surface along keyhole wall was measured using the two-color pyrometry method to confirm the Marangoni force activity on the weld pool. The results show that the inclination angle of the keyhole wall (keyhole shape) increased especially near the top surface due to the decrease in the surface tension of weld pool through surface oxidation when a shielding gas of Ar + 0.5% O<inf>2</inf> was used. Due to the change in the keyhole shape, the upward and backward shear force compositions created a large inclination angle at the top surface of the keyhole. From the temperature measurement results, the Marangoni force was found to alter the direction when 0.5% O<inf>2</inf> was mixed with the shielding gas. The shear force was found to be the strongest force among the four driving forces. The buoyant force and Lorentz force were very weak. The Marangoni force was stronger than the Lorentz force but was weaker than shear force. The interaction of shear force and Marangoni force controlled the behavior and speed of material flow on the weld pool surface. A strong upward and backward flow was observed in the case of mixture shielding gas, whereas a weak upward flow was observed for pure Ar. The heat transportation due to the weld pool convection significantly changed when only a small amount of oxygen was admixed in the shielding gas. The results can be applied to control the penetration ratio in KPAW. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Marangoni Force; Material Flow; Plasma Welding; Shear Force; Temperature Distribution","","","","This study was supported by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology and Murata Welding Laboratory under a collaboration program for exchange students and scientists.","Tomsic, Michael J., ENERGY DISTRIBUTION IN KEYHOLE MODE PLASMA ARC WELDS., Welding Journal, 53, 3, (1974); Q J Jpn Weld Soc, (2017); Fan, Honggang, Keyhole formation and collapse in plasma arc welding, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 32, 22, pp. 2902-2909, (1999); Méndez, Patricio Fernando, Welding processes for aeronautics, Advanced Materials and Processes, 159, 5, pp. 39-43, (2001); Geng, Wenhua, Microstructures and mechanical properties of plasma arc welded joints of ultra-high strength steel and aluminum alloy using Al–Si and Al–Cu fillers, ISIJ International, 58, 6, pp. 1108-1116, (2018); Taban, Emel, Plasma arc welding of modified 12% Cr stainless steel, Materials and Manufacturing Processes, 24, 6, pp. 649-656, (2009); Tanaka, Manabu, Predictions of weld pool profiles using plasma physics, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 40, 1, pp. R1-R23, (2007); Zhang, Y.

Wettst. (BM) is a botanical component of Ayurvedic medicines and of dietary supplements used worldwide for cognitive health and function. We previously reported that administration of BM alcoholic extract (BME) prevents trimethyltin (TMT)-induced cognitive deficits and hippocampal cell damage and promotes TMT-induced hippocampal neurogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that administration of BME improves spatial working memory in adolescent (5-week-old) healthy mice but not adult (8-week-old) mice. Moreover, improved spatial working memory was retained even at 4 weeks after terminating 1-week treatment of adolescent mice. One-week BME treatment of adolescent mice significantly enhanced hippocampal BrdU incorporation and expression of genes involved in neurogenesis determined by RNAseq analysis. Cell death, as detected by histochemistry, appeared not to be significant. A significant increase in neurogenesis was observed in the dentate gyrus region 4 weeks after terminating 1-week treatment of adolescent mice with BME. Bacopaside I, an active component of BME, promoted the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner via the facilitation of the Akt and ERK1/2 signaling. These results suggest that BME enhances spatial working memory in healthy adolescent mice by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and that the effects of BME are due, in significant amounts, to bacopaside I. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacopa Monnieri; Cognitive Improvement; Dentate Gyrus; Neural Stem/progenitor Cell; Neurogenesis; Rnaseq; Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 3; Neurotrophin 4; Saponin; Trimethyltin; Bacopaside I; Nootropic Agents; Plant Extracts; Saponins; Trimethyltin; Trimethyltin Compounds; Triterpenes; Bacopa Monnieri Extract; Bacopaside 1; Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptor; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 3; Neurotrophin 4; Unclassified Drug; Bacopaside I; Nootropic Agent; Plant Extract; Saponin; Trimethyltin; Triterpene; Adult; Akt Signaling; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Bacopa Monnieri; Cell Death; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Dentate Gyrus; High Performance Liquid Chromatography; Hippocampus; Histochemistry; Immunohistochemistry; In Vitro Study; Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Male; Mapk Signaling; Memory; Mouse; Mtt Assay; Nervous System Development; Neuroprotection; Nonhuman; Pi3k/akt Signaling; Signal Transduction; Spatial Memory; Working Memory; Animal; Ayurveda; Bacopa; Cell Culture; Chemistry; Dna Replication; Drug Effect; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Maze Test; Memory Disorder; Neural Stem Cell; Pathophysiology; Sexual Maturation; Short Term Memory; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Dentate Gyrus; Dna Replication; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Maze Learning; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Memory Disorders; Memory, Short-term; Mice; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Nootropic Agents; Plant Extracts; Rna-seq; Saponins; Sexual Maturation; Signal Transduction; Spatial Memory; Trimethyltin Compounds; Triterpenes","Bacopa monnieri extract; bacopaside 1; brain derived neurotrophic factor; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; neurotrophin 4; unclassified drug; bacopaside I; nootropic agent; plant extract; saponin; trimethyltin; triterpene; adult; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Bacopa monnieri; cell death; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell survival; dentate gyrus; high performance liquid chromatography; hippocampus; histochemistry; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; MAPK signaling; memory; mouse; MTT assay; nervous system development; neuroprotection; nonhuman; Pi3K/Akt signaling; signal transduction; spatial memory; working memory; animal; Ayurveda; Bacopa; cell culture; chemistry; DNA replication; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; maze test; memory disorder; neural stem cell; pathophysiology; sexual maturation; short term memory; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Dentate Gyrus; DNA Replication; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Maze Learning; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Memory Disorders; Memory, Short-Term; Mice; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Nootropic Agents; Plant Extracts; RNA-Seq; Saponins; Sexual Maturation; Signal Transduction; Spatial Memory; Trimethyltin Compounds; Triterpenes","","brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; mitogen activated protein kinase 1, 137632-08-7; mitogen activated protein kinase 3, 137632-07-6; neurotrophin 4, 148499-03-0; saponin, 8047-15-2; trimethyltin, 1631-73-8; bacopaside I; Nootropic Agents; Plant Extracts; Saponins; trimethyltin; Trimethyltin Compounds; Triterpenes","Funding text 1: This research was partially funded by National Institute of Medicinal Materials, Hanoi, Vietnam (#17-2016/HD-DTCS).

Interestingly, this type saponin was mostly found in Panax vietnamensis Ha et Grushv., Araliaceae (VG), hence making VG unique from the other Panax spp. Five OCT-type saponins, majonoside R2, vina-ginsenoside R2, majonoside R1, pseudoginsenoside RT4, vina-ginsenoside R11, together with three protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type saponins and four protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type saponins from VG were evaluated for their antimelanogenic activity. All of isolates were found to be active. More importantly, the five OCT-type saponins inhibited melanin production in B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells, without showing any cytotoxicity.

In this report, we describe an approach for fabricating a new hybrid material by coupling a gold nanorod (Au NR) core and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoS<inf>x</inf>) shell. The Au NR/MoS<inf>x</inf> core-shell structure is achieved by exploiting the hot electrons generated in the plasmonic excitation of Au NRs to drive the reduction of [MoS<inf>4</inf>]2-, which is pre-adsorbed on the Au NR surface, producing a thin MoS<inf>x</inf> layer. This approach allows us to control the thickness of the MoS<inf>x</inf> coating layer on the Au NR surface. The resultant Au NR/MoS<inf>x</inf> hybrid is characterized by absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping, x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Core Shell Nanostructures; Gold Nanorods; Molybdenum Sulfide; Photo-induced Deposition; Absorption Spectroscopy; Energy Conversion; Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy; Gold Nanorods; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Hot Electrons; Hybrid Materials; Molybdenum Compounds; Nanorods; Plasmonics; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Shells (structures); Sulfur Compounds; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Core Shell Nano Structures; Core Shell Structure; Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy; Hybrid Nanostructures; Molybdenum Sulfide; Plasmonic Nanostructures; Reduction Process; Scanning Electrons; Gold Compounds","Absorption spectroscopy; Energy conversion; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Gold Nanorods; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hot electrons; Hybrid materials; Molybdenum compounds; Nanorods; Plasmonics; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); Sulfur compounds; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Core shell nano structures; Core shell structure; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Hybrid nanostructures; Molybdenum sulfide; Plasmonic nanostructures; Reduction process; Scanning electrons; Gold compounds","","","This work was funded by the National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) through the project 103.02-2016.24 and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology through the project L0000.03/19-21.","Gaillac, Romain, ELATE: An open-source online application for analysis and visualization of elastic tensors, Journal of Physics Condensed Matter, 28, 27, (2016); Varna, Mariana, In vivo uptake and cellular distribution of gold nanoshells in a preclinical model of xenografted human renal cancer, Gold Bulletin, 46, 4, pp. 257-265, (2013); Merced-Grafals, Emmanuelle J., Repeatable, accurate, and high speed multi-level programming of memristor 1T1R arrays for power efficient analog computing applications, Nanotechnology, 27, 36, (2016); Zeinabad, Hojjat Alizadeh, Ultrasensitive interdigitated capacitance immunosensor using gold nanoparticles, Nanotechnology, 29, 26, (2018); Wang, Xiaoli, Broadband spectral signature of the ultrafast transient optical response of gold nanorods, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 119, 13, pp. 7416-7427, (2015); Palpant, Bruno, Highly dispersive thermo-optical properties of gold nanoparticles, Applied Physics Letters, 90, 22, (2007); Ringe, Emilie, Plasmon length: A universal parameter to describe size effects in gold nanoparticles, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 3, 11, pp. 1479-1483, (2012); Su, Shao, Creating SERS hot spots on MoS2 nanosheets with in situ grown gold nanoparticles, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 6, 21, pp. 18735-18741, (2014); T Sreenivasan, Sreeprasad Theruvakkattil, Controlled, defect-guided, metal-nanoparticle incorporation onto MoS 2 via chemical and microwave routes: Electrical, thermal, and structural properties, Nano Letters, 13, 9, pp. 4434-4441, (2013); Li, Yuan, Au@MoS2 Core-Shell Heterostructures with Strong Light-Matter Interactions, Nano Letters, 16, 12, pp. 7696-7702, (2016)","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","","","","","09574484; 13616528","9780080964478","NNOTE","32301441","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084272390"

In addition, the limit of each analytical methodology constrains the approach as well as the usefulness of the results in geoscience applications. Here, we report the specific mineral characterization of RE-containing ores from Yen Phu mine, Vietnam, using a range of state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with microscopy: Mössbauer spectroscopy, infrared microspectroscopy, time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Because the distribution of each element in the deposit differs, such combinatorial works are necessary and could lead to more plausible answers to questions surrounding the point of origin of RE elements. The results of our Mössbauer spectroscopic analysis indicate that the three ores sampled at different locations all contain magnetite-like, hematite-like, and iron(III) salts other than hematite. In addition, we confirmed the presence of phosphate around the grain boundary in the magnetite-like mineral phase by infrared microspectroscopic analysis. The present analytical findings of trace amounts of europium(III) using TRLFS suggest that the europium ions generate identical luminescence spectra despite being embedded in three different matrices of iron minerals. This demonstration highlights the benefits of combinatorial spectroscopic analyses to gain insights into the effects of the environment of REs on their solid-state chemistry and shows the potential utility of TRLFS as a resource mining tool. Further applications of this approach in the analytical screening of rocks and minerals are feasible. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was financially supported by the bilateral project between JSPS and VAST by the Ministry project (code DTCB.11/19/VCNXH), VINATOM.

The wood pellet was used as a feedstock with a variation of moisture content between 2 to 6 wt. %. Tar sample was taken using the JP 2009-40885 method. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry and gravimetric analysis were used to identify and to analyze the tar sample, respectively. The results show that an increase in moisture content slightly decreased the total concentration of tar formation on the nine tar compounds of the biomass. Additionally, the lowest moisture content produced the highest amount of light tar on tar classification. The amount of light tar indicates the ease of ignition in the gasifier. Therefore, this condition will minimize the failure-of-equipment problem because of no clogs in the gasifier equipment.

There are three types of displacement-measuring interferometers: homodyne, heterodyne, and frequency modulation (FM) interferometers. Among these types of interferometer, the FM interferometer has many advantageous features. The interference signal is a series of time-dependent harmonics of modulation frequency, so the phase shift can be detected accurately using the synchronous detection method. Moreover, theFMinterferometer is the most suitable for combination with a frequency-locked laser because both require frequency modulation. In previous research, low modulation frequencies at some tens of kHz have been used to lock the frequency of laser diodes (LDs). The low modulation frequency for the laser source means that the maximum measurement speed of the FM interferometers is limited. This paper proposes a novel contribution regarding the application of a high-frequency modulation for an LD to improve both the frequency stability of the laser source and the measurement speed of the FM interferometer. The frequency of the LD was locked to an I<inf>2</inf> hyperfine component at 1 MHz modulation frequency. A high bandwidth lock-in amplifier was utilized to detect the saturated absorption signals of the I<inf>2</inf> hyperfine structure and induce the signal to lock the frequency of the LD. The locked LD was then used for an FM displacement measuring interferometer. Moreover, a suitable modulation amplitude that affected the signal-to-noise ratio of both the I<inf>2</inf> absorption signal and the harmonic intensity of the interference signal was determined. In order to verify the measurement resolution of the proposed interferometer, the displacement induced by a piezo electric actuator was concurrently measured by the interferometer and a capacitive sensor. The difference of the displacement results was less than 20 nm. To evaluate the measurement speed, the interferometer was used to measure the axial error of a high-speed spindle at 500 rpm. The main conclusion of this study is that a stable displacement interferometer with high accuracy and a high measurement speed can be achieved using an LD frequency locked to an I2 hyperfine transition at a high modulation frequency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Frequency Modulation Interferometer; Frequency-locked Laser Diode; I2 Hyperfine Structure; Lock-in Amplifier","","","","This work was funded by the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training under Project Number B2018-BKA-07 CTrVL.","Pogačnik, Aljaž, A homodyne quadrature laser interferometer for micro-asperity deformation analysis, Sensors, 13, 1, pp. 703-720, (2013); Cui, Junning, Homodyne laser interferometer involving minimal quadrature phase error to obtain subnanometer nonlinearity, Applied Optics, 55, 25, pp. 7086-7092, (2016); Köchert, Paul, Phase measurement of various commercial heterodyne He-Ne-laser interferometers with stability in the picometer regime, Measurement Science and Technology, 23, 7, (2012); Yan, Hao, A dual-heterodyne laser interferometer for simultaneous measurement of linear and angular displacements, Review of Scientific Instruments, 86, 12, (2015); Brand, Uwe, Frequency stabilization of a HeNe laser at 543.5 nm wavelength using frequency-modulation spectroscopy, Optics Communications, 100, 1-4, pp. 361-373, (1993); Nomura, Junia, Precision spectroscopy and frequency stabilization using coin-sized laser modules, Journal of the Optical Society of America B: Optical Physics, 36, 3, pp. 631-637, (2019); Ikeda, Kohei, Iodine-stabilized laser at telecom wavelength using dual-pitch periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide, Optics Express, 28, 2, pp. 2166-2178, (2020); Lawall, John R., Michelson interferometry with 10 pm accuracy, Review of Scientific Instruments, 71, 7, pp. 2669-2676, (2000); Pisani, Marco Q., Multiple reflection Michelson interferometer with picometer resolution, Optics Express, 16, 26, pp. 21558-21563, (2008); Zhang, Enzheng, Laser heterodyne interference signal processing method based on phase shift of reference signal, Optics Express, 26, 7, pp. 8656-8668, (2018)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084674473"

A total of three small-scale models of TSTs were used for the investigation, including non-strengthened specimens, specimens strengthened with 0ffi CFRP layers, and specimens strengthened with 0°/90° CFRP layers. There were two types of tests for every specimen: the static and dynamic tests. A new experimental method using small steel balls was applied to create internal pressure in the TSTs. The results show that small steel balls could be used to increase the internal pressure compared to a normal liquid. Furthermore, the similarity rules for small-scale TSTs with small steel balls inside were also studied to consider the applicability of the models. The experimental results indicated that the CFRP layer could effectively restrain both static and dynamic hoop strains in the TSTs. Moreover, the CFRP layer could also remarkably reduce the impact of sloshing on the TST shells. The 0° CFRP layer proved to have better effects than the 0°/90° CFRP layers on the strengthening of the TSTs against dynamic loads. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cfrp; Dynamic Load; Strengthening Effect; Thin-walled Storage Tank","","","","","Reconnaissance Report on the 2010 Chile Off Maule Earthquake and Reconnaissance Report on the 2011 New Zealand Christchurch Earthquake, (2012); Preliminary Reconnaissance Report of the 2011 Tohoku Chiho Taiheiyo Oki Earthquake, (2012); Seismic Fragility Formulations for Water Systems, (2001); Design Recommendation for Storage Tanks and their Supports with Emphasis on Seismic Design, (2010); Earthquake Resistant Structures Design Assessment and Rehabilitation Chapter 12, (2012); Buckling of Thin Walled Circular Cylinders, (1968); Teng, Jin-Guang, Buckling of thin shells: Recent advances and trends, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 49, 4, pp. 263-274, (1996); 6th National Congress on Civil Engineering, (2011); Shih, Choon Foo, FAILURE OF LIQUID STORAGE TANKS DUE TO EARTHQUAKE EXCITATION., 81-4, (1981); Hamdan, Fadi H., Seismic behaviour of cylindrical steel liquid storage tanks, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 53, 3, pp. 307-333, (2000)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083402622"

The effectiveness of early intervention for MPS has been reported. Multiple-assay formats using tandem mass spectrometry have been developed. Here, we developed a method for simultaneous preparation and better measurement of the activities of five enzymes involved in MPSs, i.e., MPS I, MPS II, MPS IIIB, MPS IVA, and MPS VI, which were validated using 672 dried blood spot samples obtained from healthy newborns and 23 patients with MPS. The mean values of the enzyme activities and standard deviations in controls were as follows: α-iduronidase (IDUA), 4.19 ± 1.53 µM/h; iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S), 8.39 ± 2.82 µM/h; N-acetyl-α-glucosaminidase (NAGLU), 1.96 ± 0.57 µM/h; N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), 0.50 ± 0.20 µM/h; and N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ARSB), 2.64 ± 1.01 µM/h. All patients displayed absent or low enzyme activity. In MPS I, IIIB, and VI, each patient group was clearly separated from controls, whereas there was some overlap between the control and patient groups in MPS II and IVA, suggesting the occurrence of pseudo-deficiencies. Thus, we established a multiplex assay for newborn screening using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, allowing simultaneous pretreatment and measurement of five enzymes relevant to MPSs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Enzyme Assay; Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Mucopolysaccharidosis; Newborn Screening; Alpha N Acetylglucosaminidase; Iduronate 2 Sulfatase; Levo Iduronidase; N Acetylgalactosamine 4 Sulfatase; N Acetylgalactosamine 6 Sulfatase; Glycosaminoglycans; Iduronidase; Alpha N Acetylglucosaminidase; Iduronate 2 Sulfatase; Levo Iduronidase; N Acetylgalactosamine 4 Sulfatase; N Acetylgalactosamine 6 Sulfatase; Glycosaminoglycan; Article; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Dried Blood Spot Testing; Electrospray; Enzyme Activity; Enzyme Replacement; Human; Hurler Syndrome; Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Maroteaux Lamy Syndrome; Mucopolysaccharidosis Iiib; Newborn; Newborn Screening; Pathogenesis; Protein Stability; Sanfilippo Syndrome; Validation Process; Blood; Enzyme Assay; Enzymology; Hunter Syndrome; Liquid Chromatography; Metabolism; Morquio Syndrome; Mucopolysaccharidosis; Procedures; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Chromatography, Liquid; Enzyme Assays; Glycosaminoglycans; Humans; Iduronidase; Infant, Newborn; Mucopolysaccharidoses; Mucopolysaccharidosis I; Mucopolysaccharidosis Ii; Mucopolysaccharidosis Iii; Mucopolysaccharidosis Iv; Mucopolysaccharidosis Vi; Neonatal Screening; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","alpha n acetylglucosaminidase; iduronate 2 sulfatase; levo iduronidase; n acetylgalactosamine 4 sulfatase; n acetylgalactosamine 6 sulfatase; glycosaminoglycan; Article; clinical article; controlled study; dried blood spot testing; electrospray; enzyme activity; enzyme replacement; human; Hurler syndrome; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; Maroteaux Lamy syndrome; mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB; newborn; newborn screening; pathogenesis; protein stability; Sanfilippo syndrome; validation process; blood; enzyme assay; enzymology; Hunter syndrome; liquid chromatography; metabolism; Morquio syndrome; mucopolysaccharidosis; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; Chromatography, Liquid; Enzyme Assays; Glycosaminoglycans; Humans; Iduronidase; Infant, Newborn; Mucopolysaccharidoses; Mucopolysaccharidosis I; Mucopolysaccharidosis II; Mucopolysaccharidosis III; Mucopolysaccharidosis IV; Mucopolysaccharidosis VI; Neonatal Screening; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","","alpha n acetylglucosaminidase, 37288-40-7; iduronate 2 sulfatase, 50936-59-9, 1271734-34-9; levo iduronidase; n acetylgalactosamine 4 sulfatase, 55354-43-3, 9012-81-1; n acetylgalactosamine 6 sulfatase, 59299-00-2, 9025-60-9; Glycosaminoglycans; Iduronidase","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: This work was supported by T.

The aim is to predict many probable damage patterns in a huge number of scenarios under complex strain conditions and to discuss the influential level of variability in the physical and geometrical parameters for short fiber reinforced composites. The parameterization and numerical modelling for short fiber reinforced plastics made by injection molding are conducted. The random physical parameters are considered theoretically by the first-order perturbation based stochastic homogenization method, while sampling is used for the random geometrical parameters. When the scenario becomes huge in the stochastic nonlinear analysis, a computational scheme using sub-sampling is proposed. Moreover, the stochastic prediction of the homogenized properties of the composite material and their probable degradation are discussed. The stochastic computation of microscopic strains is analyzed though the damage propagation simulation. When the geometrical variability is considered, a definition of an average strain distribution among many samples is also presented. The efficiency of the accelerated element-by-element scaled conjugate gradient iterative solver is shown by solving many three-dimension random short fiber reinforced models with hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom. The stochastic computational scheme provides a suitable reference to predict failure under specific reliability requirements of short fiber reinforced composites or other composite materials. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fiber Reinforced Composites; Microscopic Damage Evolution; Sampling And Sub-sampling; Stochastic Finite Element Method; Variability; Degrees Of Freedom (mechanics); Fiber Reinforced Plastics; Fibers; Forecasting; Geometry; Homogenization Method; Injection Molding; Iterative Methods; Nonlinear Analysis; Plastics Molding; Sheet Molding Compounds; Strain; Homogenized Properties; Random Physical Parameters; Reliability Requirements; Scaled Conjugate Gradients; Short Fiber Reinforced Plastics; Short-fiber-reinforced Composites; Stochastic Computations; Stochastic Homogenization; Stochastic Systems","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Forecasting; Geometry; Homogenization method; Injection molding; Iterative methods; Nonlinear analysis; Plastics molding; Sheet molding compounds; Strain; Homogenized properties; Random physical parameters; Reliability requirements; Scaled conjugate gradients; Short fiber reinforced plastics; Short-fiber-reinforced composites; Stochastic computations; Stochastic homogenization; Stochastic systems","","","This work was supported by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (KAKENHI Grant No. 16H04239).

Tar analysis is a challenging task because it is a complex mixture. The objectives of this study are to identify and quantify the major tar compounds in raw producer gas and deposits from a 10 kW downdraft gasifier using cedar pellets. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the 16 tar samples from raw producer gas under varying airflow rates and four tar samples from the deposit inside the suction pump after long-term operation. The results showed that tar in raw producer gas and tar deposits consisted of about 46 and 28 major chemical compounds, respectively. Tar in raw producer gas was found to contain three main groups of substances, including acids/ketones with 32.1 wt%, heterocyclics with 30.0 wt%, and light poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (light PAHs) with 31.8 wt%. Heterocyclic and light PAH compounds dominated in tar deposits and accounted for 58.6 wt% and 36.2 wt%, respectively. It was observed that the tar condensation problem was dominated by the components and the molecular weight of tar compositions instead of the tar concentration. These findings are useful for optimizing the gasification process and developing the gas cleaning system for a small downdraft gasifier. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass Gasification; Deposit; Producer Gas; Small Downdraft Gasifier; Tar Composition; Deposits; Gas Chromatography; Gases; Gasification; Mass Spectrometry; Petroleum Deposits; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Biomass Gasification; Condensation Problems; Downdraft Gasifier; Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometries (gc-ms); Gas Cleaning Systems; Gasification Process; Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Tar Concentration; Tar; Analysis; Fuel Gas; Gas Chromatography; Light; Samples","Deposits; Gas chromatography; Gases; Gasification; Mass spectrometry; Petroleum deposits; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Biomass Gasification; Condensation problems; Downdraft gasifier; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometries (GC-MS); Gas cleaning systems; Gasification process; Poly aromatic hydrocarbons; Tar concentration; Tar; Analysis; Fuel Gas; Gas Chromatography; Light; Samples","","","Anh Vo Cong would like to thank the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training, Kanazawa University for its support through the Vietnamese Government Scholarship (911 Project) during the Ph.D. course.","Al-Rahbi, Amal Salim Said, Thermal decomposition and gasification of biomass pyrolysis gases using a hot bed of waste derived pyrolysis char, Bioresource Technology, 204, pp. 71-79, (2016); Amini, Elham, Characterization of pyrolysis products from slow pyrolysis of live and dead vegetation native to the southern United States, Fuel, 235, pp. 1475-1491, (2019); Anis, Samsudin, Tar reduction in biomass producer gas via mechanical, catalytic and thermal methods: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, 5, pp. 2355-2377, (2011); Atnaw, Samson Mekbib, Study on tar generated from downdraft gasification of oil palm fronds, Scientific World Journal, 2014, (2014); Chang, Guozhang, The lignin pyrolysis composition and pyrolysis products of palm kernel shell, wheat straw, and pine sawdust, Energy Conversion and Management, 124, pp. 587-597, (2016); DemirbaÅ&#x9f;, Ayhan Hilal, Effect of temperature on pyrolysis products from biomass, Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, 29, 4, pp. 329-336, (2007); Developments in Thermochemical Biomass Conversion, (1997); Galindo Noguera, Ana Lisbeth, Biomass gasification in a downdraft gasifier with a two-stage air supply: Effect of operating conditions on gas quality, Biomass and Bioenergy, 61, pp. 236-244, (2014); Hernández, J.

To validate our theoretical approach, we carry out finite difference time domain simulations and compare computational results with theoretical calculations. Quantitatively good agreements among theoretical predictions, simulations, and previous experiments allow us to employ this proposed theoretical model to generate reliable data for training and testing deep neural networks.

Microbubbles are colloidal gas aphrons stabilized by thick shells of polymer and surfactant. The stability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles plays an important role in improving the performance of enhanced oil recovery. In this study, a new class of design of experiment (DOE)—definitive screening design (DSD) was employed to investigate the effect of five quantitative parameters: xanthan gum polymer concentration, sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant concentration, salinity, stirring time, and stirring rate. This is a three-level design that required only 11 experimental runs. The results suggest that DSD successfully evaluated how various parameters contribute to CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble stability. The definitive screening design revealed a polynomial regression model has ability to estimate the main effect factor, two-factor interactions and pure-quadratic effect of factors with high determination coefficients for its smaller number of experiments compared to traditional design of experiment approach. The experimental results showed that the stability depend primarily on xanthan gum polymer concentration. It was also found that the stability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles increases at a higher sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant concentration and stirring rate, but decreases with increasing salinity. In addition, several interactions are presented to be significant including the polymer–salinity interaction, surfactant–salinity interaction and stirring rate–salinity interaction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co2 Eor; Co2 Microbubbles; Colloidal Gas Aphrons; Definitive Screening Design; Design Of Experiment; Stability","","","","The authors are grateful to Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

However, it still keeps a disadvantage such as the transfer distance is short which is the most difficult to eliminate. Moreover, the relative position of the transmitter and the receiver depends on the movement of the electric vehicles in the dynamic wireless charging. Therefore the average efficiency is low in the charging area when the electric vehicle runs away from the optimized position of the transfer system. In this paper, a 13.56MHz antenna is designed by the finite element analysis. At the highest efficiency, the transfer distance is 55 cm. Otherwise, the solution to improve efficiency due to the variation of the charging position is proposed. The coupling system is strongly coupled magnetic resonance technology. The impedance is dynamically matched in the transmitter to improve the transfer efficiency. In the simulation, the 91.2% highest efficiency at 55 cm is obtained and it is improved maximum of 56.4% within 55 cm transfer distance and 40 cm misalignment with the proposed solution.

In this study, piperitenone oxide and trans-piperitenone dioxide were prepared as racemic forms by epoxidation of piperitenone. The relative configuration between two epoxides in piperitenone dioxide was determined to be trans by1H NMR analysis and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Optical resolution of (±)-piperitenone oxide by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral stationary phase (CSP) afforded both enantiomers with over 98% enantiomeric excess (ee). Evaluation of the differentiation-inducing activity of the synthetic compounds revealed that the epoxide at C-1 and C-6 in piperitenone oxide is important for the activity, and (+)-piperitenone oxide has stronger activity than (–)-piperitenone oxide. The results obtained in this study provide new information on the application of piperitenone oxide and spearmint for differentiation-inducing therapy. Furthermore, natural piperitenone oxide was isolated from M. spicata. The enantiomeric excess of the isolated natural piperitenone oxide was 66% ee. Epoxidation of piperitenone with hydrogen peroxide proceeded in a phosphate buffer under weak basic conditions to give (±)-piperitenone oxide. These results suggest that the nonenzymatic epoxidation of piperitenone, which causes a decrease in the enantiomeric excess of natural piperitenone oxide, is accompanied by an enzymatic epoxidation in the biosynthesis of piperitenone oxide. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Differentiation-inducing Activity; Piperitenone; Piperitenone Oxide; Structure-activity Relationships; Piperitenone; Epoxy Compounds; Monoterpenes; Oils, Volatile; Piperitenone; Biochemistry; Enantiomers; Essential Oils; High Performance Liquid Chromatography; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Stereochemistry; Chemical Constituents; Chiral Stationary Phase; Enantiomeric Excess; Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy; Optical Resolution; Stronger Activities; Structure Activity Relationships; Synthetic Compounds; Density Functional Theory; Epoxide; Essential Oil; Piperitenone; Terpene; Cell Differentiation; Chemistry; Colon Tumor; Conformation; Drug Effect; Human; Isolation And Purification; Mentha Spicata; Pathology; Phytotherapy; Stereoisomerism; Structure Activity Relation; Synthesis; Tumor Cell Culture; Cell Differentiation; Colonic Neoplasms; Epoxy Compounds; Humans; Molecular Conformation; Monoterpenes; Oils, Volatile; Phytotherapy; Stereoisomerism; Structure-activity Relationship; Tumor Cells, Cultured","Biochemistry; Enantiomers; Essential oils; High performance liquid chromatography; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Stereochemistry; Chemical constituents; Chiral stationary phase; Enantiomeric excess; Nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy; Optical resolution; Stronger activities; Structure activity relationships; Synthetic compounds; Density functional theory; epoxide; essential oil; piperitenone; terpene; cell differentiation; chemistry; colon tumor; conformation; drug effect; human; isolation and purification; Mentha spicata; pathology; phytotherapy; stereoisomerism; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell culture; Cell Differentiation; Colonic Neoplasms; Epoxy Compounds; Humans; Molecular Conformation; Monoterpenes; Oils, Volatile; Phytotherapy; Stereoisomerism; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tumor Cells, Cultured","","piperitenone, 491-09-8; Epoxy Compounds; Monoterpenes; Oils, Volatile; piperitenone","","Božović, Mijat, Mentha suaveolens Ehrh.

In the experiment, we extracted bark and leaves of kluwih to obtain insecticidal material to repel Anopheles sp. To ensure the precise extraction and insecticidial effect, the experiments were conducted four times with three repetitions. For each experiment, we used 8.4 mL with the concentrations of 20, 30, and 40% of flavonoid.

Four WMP models were built based on the feature of the region, the intention and optimisation of WMP, and the consensus of the government. This study shows that the improvement of the SWM system can reduce a significant amount of waste to landfill. Notably, the waste reduction performance is 5.0, 7.8, 11.11 and 29.3 % in S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively. Also, the recovery performance of recyclables changes in proportional to the level of SWM practice and reach at 3.78, 5.843, 4.593, and 7.120 t/d, respectively.

Reducing waste sent to landfill has become an emerging mission in Vietnam. This study aims at assessing cost-effective solutions to reduce waste-to-landfill amount using system analysis approach. A single-objective optimisation model is formulated to minimise the cost of the system in association with different landfill waste reduction targets and values of waste separation efficiency for Hoi An city. As a result, the landfill target is directly proportional to the cost. It means the higher landfill reduction target leads to the higher cost of the system. Meanwhile, the separation efficiency is inversely proportional to the system cost. The result showed that twenty-five percent of municipal waste treated in landfills is achievable target based on the current condition of the city. Also, ten percent of municipal waste sent to landfill is an infeasible mission if the waste separation rate is too low. If waste is wholly separated at source, incineration, composting and landfill can be applied as main treatment alternatives to reduce seventy-five percent of municipal waste sent to landfill with the cost of about 1,800 USD/d. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The research is funded and supported by Okayama University, Japan.

However, poor early bone tissue integration is still a common cause of implant failure. This could be modulated by improving the material bonding or adhesion directly to the bone by surface roughening and/or a bioresorbable and osteoconductive coating. In this study, we report on the biological behaviours of the Ti substrate with modified surface roughness and/or a calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) coating. The roughened Ti surface was prepared using an acid etching reaction, and the CaCO<inf>3</inf> coating on the substrates was synthesized by the hydrothermal treatment of Ti in calcium citrate complexes. This study demonstrates that surface roughening of Ti alone does not improve the biological response of the MC3T3-E1 cells, but a CaCO<inf>3</inf> coating on the smooth Ti surface increases cell responses, and these effects are further enhanced by the combination of coating a roughened Ti surface with CaCO<inf>3</inf>.

The 405 beach placer borehole samples were collected from Southern Suoi Nhum deposit, Binh Thuan province, Vietnam, to test the feasibility of these soft computing techniques in estimating ilmenite content. Heavy mineral analysis indicated that valuable minerals in the placer sand are zircon, ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, anatase, and monazite. In this study, five materials, namely rutile, anatase, leucoxene, zircon, and monazite, were used as the input variables to estimate ilmenite content based on the above mentioned soft computing models. Of the whole dataset, 325 samples were used to build the regarded soft computing models; 80 remaining samples were used for the models' verification. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R2), a simple ranking method, and residuals analysis technique were used as the statistical criteria for assessing the model performances. The numerical experiments revealed that soft computing techniques are capable of estimating the content of ilmenite with high accuracy. The residuals analysis also indicated that the SGB model was the most suitable for determining the ilmenite content in the context of this research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Applied Soft Computing; Artificial Intelligence; Beach Placer; Ilmenite Content; Titanium Placer","","","","This work received no external funding.

Currently, most research focuses on improving membrane performance, both in terms of permeability and selectivity. Only a few studies have paid attention to how the membrane module is configured and operated. In this study, the geometric design and operating conditions of a membrane module are considered as multivariable optimization variables. The objective function is the annual cost. The cost consists of a capital investment depending on the plant scale and an operating expense associated with energy consumption. In the optimization problem, the channel dimensions (width × length × height), and operating conditions (the inlet pressure and recirculation flow rate) were considered as decision variables. The operating configuration of the membrane plant is assumed to be feed and bleed mode, and a model including the pressure drop is introduced. The model is used to simulate the membrane plant and calculate the membrane area and energy usage, which are directly related to the total cost. The genetic algorithm is used for the optimization. The effect of individual parameters on the total cost is discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-flow; Membrane Module; Modeling; Optimization; Protein Solution; Ultrafiltration","","","","The authors would like to thank Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Tokyo Institute of Technology for the kind support during the preparation of the manuscript.","Mores, Patricia, Membrane-based processes: Optimization of hydrogen separation by minimization of power, membrane area, and cost, Processes, 6, 11, (2018); Ramírez-Santos, Álvaro Andres, Optimization of multistage membrane gas separation processes.

The synthesized MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf> NPs have a polyhedral morphology with cubic spinel structure, homogeneously distributed Mn, Co, and O elements, and an average size less than 50 nm. As demonstrated, MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf> NPs showed the highest catalytic activity among all tested catalysts (MnO<inf>2</inf>, CoO) and outperformed other spinel-based catalysts for Methylene Blue (MB) degradation. The MB degradation efficiency reached 100% after 25 min of reaction under initial conditions of 500 mg L-1 Oxone, 20 mg L-1 MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf>, 20 mg L-1 MB, unadjusted pH, and T = 25 °C. MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf> NPs showed a great catalytic activity in a wide pH range (3.5-11), catalyst dose (10-60 mg L-1), Oxone concentration (300-1500 mg L-1), MB concentration (5-40 mg L-1), and temperature (25-55 °C). HCO<inf>3</inf>-, CO<inf>3</inf>2- and particularly Cl- coexisting anions were found to inhibit the catalytic activity of MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf> NPs. Radical quenching experiments revealed that sulfate radicals are primarily responsible for MB degradation. A reaction sequence for the catalytic activation of PMS was proposed. The as-prepared MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf> NPs could be reused for at least three consecutive cycles with small deterioration in their performance due to low metal leaching.

To date, many TFs have been shown to positively mediate plant responses to environmental stresses. In the current study, the biological functions of a stress-responsive NAC [NAM (No Apical Meristem), ATAF1/2 (Arabidopsis Transcription Activation Factor1/2), CUC2 (Cup-shaped Cotyledon2)]-TF encoding gene isolated from soybean (GmNAC019) in relation to plant drought tolerance and abscisic acid (ABA) responses were investigated. By using a heterologous transgenic system, we revealed that transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing the GmNAC019 gene exhibited higher survival rates in a soil-drying assay, which was associated with lower water loss rate in detached leaves, lower cellular hydrogen peroxide content and stronger antioxidant defense under water-stressed conditions. Additionally, the exogenous treatment of transgenic plants with ABA showed their hypersensitivity to this phytohormone, exhibiting lower rates of seed germination and green cotyledons. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that GmNAC019 functions as a positive regulator of ABA-mediated plant response to drought, and thus, it has potential utility for improving plant tolerance through molecular biotechnology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aba-mediated Response; Drought Tolerance; Gmnac019; Transgenic Arabidopsis; Abscisic Acid; Catalase; Hydrogen Peroxide; Soybean Protein; Abscisic Acid; Soybean Proteins; Transcription Factors; Abscisic Acid; Catalase; Gmnac019; Hydrogen Peroxide; Phytohormone; Transcription Factor; Unclassified Drug; Soybean Protein; Apical Meristem; Arabidopsis; Article; Controlled Study; Drought Stress; Drought Tolerance; Ectopic Expression; Environmental Stress; Enzyme Activity; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Sequence; Genetic Transcription; Germination; Growth Retardation; Nonhuman; Oxidative Stress; Phenotype; Plant Development; Plant Growth; Promoter Region; Protein Expression; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Root Length; Seedling; Signal Transduction; Soybean; Transgene; Transgenic Plant; Upregulation; Water Loss; Biosynthesis; Dehydration; Disease Resistance; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Abscisic Acid; Dehydration; Disease Resistance; Plants, Genetically Modified; Soybean Proteins; Soybeans; Transcription Factors","abscisic acid; catalase; GmNAC019; hydrogen peroxide; phytohormone; transcription factor; unclassified drug; soybean protein; apical meristem; Arabidopsis; Article; controlled study; drought stress; drought tolerance; ectopic expression; environmental stress; enzyme activity; gene; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic transcription; germination; growth retardation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phenotype; plant development; plant growth; promoter region; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; root length; seedling; signal transduction; soybean; transgene; transgenic plant; upregulation; water loss; biosynthesis; dehydration; disease resistance; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Abscisic Acid; Dehydration; Disease Resistance; Plants, Genetically Modified; Soybean Proteins; Soybeans; Transcription Factors","","abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; catalase, 9001-05-2; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; soybean protein, 9010-10-0; Abscisic Acid; Soybean Proteins; Transcription Factors","Funding: This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number “106-NN.02-2015.85.”","Yadav, Narendra Singh, The SbSOS1 gene from the extreme halophyte Salicornia brachiata enhances Na+ loading in xylem and confers salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco, BMC Plant Biology, 12, (2012); Thi Hoang, Xuan Lan Thi, Transcription factors and their roles in signal transduction in plants under abiotic stresses, Current Genomics, 18, 6, pp. 483-497, (2017); Zhu, Jian Kang, Abiotic Stress Signaling and Responses in Plants, Cell, 167, 2, pp. 313-324, (2016); He, Mei, Abiotic stresses: General defenses of land plants and chances for engineering multistress tolerance, Frontiers in Plant Science, 871, (2018); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Molecular characterization of stress-inducible GmNAC genes in soybean, Molecular Genetics and Genomics, 281, 6, pp. 647-664, (2009); Baillo, Elamin Hafiz, Transcription factors associated with abiotic and biotic stress tolerance and their potential for crops improvement, Genes, 10, 10, (2019); Xie, Zhouli, AP2/ERF transcription factor regulatory networks in hormone and abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis, Frontiers in Plant Science, 10, (2019); Srivastava, Rajat, The expanding roles of APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factors and their potential applications in crop improvement, Briefings in Functional Genomics, 18, 4, pp. 240-254, (2019); Marques, Deyvid Novaes, Plant NAC transcription factors responsive to abiotic stresses, Plant Gene, 11, pp. 170-179, (2017); Tweneboah, Solomon, Biological roles of NAC transcription factors in the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses in solanaceous crops, Journal of Plant Biotechnology, 44, 1, pp. 1-11, (2017)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","14220067; 16616596","","","31906240","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077575436"

We have invented three dimensional real-time MR image guided endoscopic surgical system using microwave devices which does not emit X-ray. This study aims to establish a less invasive operation system mentioned above. Developed Materials are as follows: (1) software for driving system, imaging of 3T MR scanner and integration of them. (2) MR compatible endoscope with position-direction sensor. (3) microwave energy devices for flexible endoscope. (4) new bending mechanism for catheter and guidewire. For (1) and (2), MR compatible flexible endoscope was invented which could be applied to the operation under 3T MR scanner. Its position and direction of tip is able to be timely reflected on the MR image. For (3), microwave energy was selected by the reason why this frequency band does not interfere with MR imaging. Microwave devices were developed not only MR compatible forceps for endoscope but also devices for open surgery. Open surgery microwave devices, “Acrosurg”, are already commercialized in Japan. For (4), new bending mechanism for catheter has been invented. The prototype catheter 0.58 mm in diameter could be bent with this mechanism. This mechanism is applied to endoscopic forceps, catheter for vessels and intestine. We evaluated the system integrated with developed technologies (1)–(3) using 5 mini pigs under general anesthesia. Laparoscopic liver ablation was performed with 3D real-time MR image guided. Now, we succeeded in a laparoscopic ablation of virtual liver cancer with microwave needle under this system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexible Endoscope; Laparoscopic Surgery; Microwave; Mr Compatible; Mr Image; Ablation; Biomedical Engineering; Catheters; Developing Countries; Endoscopy; Laparoscopy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mammals; Microwave Devices; Scanning; Surgery; Direction Sensors; Flexible Endoscopes; General Anesthesias; Invasive Treatment; Laparoscopic Surgery; Microwave Energies; Mr Images; Mr-compatible; Microwaves","Ablation; Biomedical engineering; Catheters; Developing countries; Endoscopy; Laparoscopy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammals; Microwave devices; Scanning; Surgery; Direction sensors; Flexible endoscopes; General anesthesias; Invasive treatment; Laparoscopic surgery; Microwave energies; MR images; MR-compatible; Microwaves","","","","Himal, Harry Sander, Minimally invasive (laparoscopic) surgery: The future of general surgery, Surgical Endoscopy, 16, 12, pp. 1647-1652, (2002); Schenck, John F., Superconducting open-configuration MR imaging system for image-guided therapy, Radiology, 195, 3, pp. 805-814, (1995); Naka, Shigeyuki, Tumor ablation with MRI navigation--a novel method of microwave coagulation therapy for hepatic tumor, Japanese Journal of Cancer and Chemotherapy, 28, 11, pp. 1591-1594, (2001); New Perspect Cancer Res Therapy, (2005); Accas 2016, (2016); Yamada, Atsushi, A Loop-Shaped Flexible Mechanism for Robotic Needle Steering, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 3, 2, pp. 648-655, (2018); Takebayashi, Katsushi, Utility of a microwave surgical instrument in sealing lymphatic vessels, American Journal of Surgery, 206, 2, pp. 229-233, (2013)","Van Toi, V.; Le, T.Q.; Ngo, H.T.; Nguyen, T.-H.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","British Council; et al.; IFMBE; Newton Fund; Springer; VNPT","7th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering in Vietnam, BME 2018","","Ho Chi Minh","226999","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067578393"

Our data show that changes in electrical properties indicating hemolysis are observed under high frequency conditions. Moreover, the impedance increase related to the release of cytoplasm into plasma and increment of hemoglobin’s amount. The highest resistance of second semi-circle (Z′) shows a linear relationship with the hemoglobin concentration (H<inf>b</inf>).

Then, a microwave scissor-shaped surgical instrument (Acrosurg.®) has been invented and employed for pre-clinical experiments. Methods An animal study using specific pathogen-free pigs was conducted to compare surgical functions of newly developed microwave coagulation surgical instrument (Acrosurg.®) with current electrosurgical devices such as the electric current-based LigaSure™ Small Jaw Sealer (LS) and the ultrasound-based Harmonic Focus® Shears (HF). The Acrosurg.® was tested on 5 mm vessels with regard to seal time, burst pressure (BP), lateral thermal injury (LTI), cutting time for hepatectomy and mesenterectomy. Results In the Acrosurg.®’s group, the seal time for 5 mm vessels was shorter and LTI was narrower in comparison with the outcomes in the LigaSure™’s group. Although BP in the Acrosurg.®’s group was lower than BP in the LigaSure™’s group, it reached approximately 900 mmHg. Cutting time for hepatectomy was not different in both groups (Acrosurg.® and Harmonic Focus®) but time consumption for mesenterectomy in the Acrosurg.®’s group was significantly shorter. There were some bleedings existing in both groups but achieving complete hemostasis. Conclusion Novel microwave coagulation surgical instrument has the same effectiveness as compared to other commercialized energy devices. Moreover, it is more advantageous to some specific tissues and could be considered on clinical trial. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrosurgical Device; High Frequency; Microwave; Microwave Coagulation Surgical Instrument; Ultrasound; Biomedical Engineering; Coagulation; Developing Countries; Mammals; Microwaves; Surgical Equipment; Ultrasonics; Comparative Studies; Electrosurgical Device; High Frequency Hf; Microwave Energies; Surgical Devices; Surgical Instrument; Thermal Injuries; Time Consumption; Surgery","Biomedical engineering; Coagulation; Developing countries; Mammals; Microwaves; Surgical equipment; Ultrasonics; Comparative studies; Electrosurgical device; High frequency HF; Microwave energies; Surgical devices; Surgical instrument; Thermal injuries; Time consumption; Surgery","","","Funding text 1: The authors express high gratitude to the doctors and techinicians from the Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science for their supports.

The purpose of this study was to introduce a simple and effective protocol to prepare decellularized porcine vessels. Porcine carotid arteries (pCA) were decellularized by 4 methods including 3 commonly protocols: SDS 0.5% for 24 h or distilled water for 24 h or Triton X100 0.1% for 24 h and our protocol, combination of SDS 0.5% 24 h and distilled water for 24 h. After removing the cells, structure and collagen were determined by Heamatoxylin/Eosin (HE) and Trichrome staining. In vitro cytotoxicity test on fibroblasts was performed according to ISO 10993-5. Additionally, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded on the acellular porcine carotid arteries (aCA) pieces to examine their attachment and growth for 11 days. To investigate in vivo behaviors, aCA were implanted subcutaneously into mouse dorsal skin (Dacron grafts were used as control) and grafts were then isolated and stained with HE after 7, 14, 28 days. The results showed that our protocol removed all cells and maximally preserve extracellular matrix (ECM) comparing to other basis methods. aCA are non-toxic to fibroblast (level 0) and evoked weak inflammation in vivo which was absent in week 4 (similar to Dacron grafts).

Firstly, we collect EEG signal by five types of eye movement: Blink, Double blink, look at Right, look at Left and Relax. These movements correspond to five directions of wheelchair motion: Go forward, Go backward, Turn right, Turn left and Stop. After that, the offline EEG signal is analyzed using MATLAB to find out the classified threshold of the signal amplitude in Alpha band and Delta band. Finally, an effective algorithm is built allowing us to identify the type of eye movement and control the external device—the powered wheelchair. As the result, the average accuracy for five motion directions (Go forward, Go backward, Turn right, Turn left and Stop) are 92.333, 93, 81.667, 86.667 and 83% respectively. With this study, we expect it can give people the help they need and be applied to many fields in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brainwave Control Algorithm; Eeg; Eye Movement; Wheelchair; Biomedical Engineering; Developing Countries; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Wheelchairs; Eeg Signals; Effective Algorithms; Motion Direction; Offline; Powered Wheel Chairs; Signal Amplitude; Eye Movements","Biomedical engineering; Developing countries; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Wheelchairs; EEG signals; Effective algorithms; Motion direction; Offline; Powered wheel chairs; Signal amplitude; Eye movements","","","","Brain Computer Interface Scientific Contextual EEG, (2014); Gupta, Soumya Sen, Detecting eye movements in EEG for controlling devices, pp. 69-73, (2012); Tran, Hue T., An EEG-controlled wheelchair using eye movements, IFMBE Proceedings, 46, pp. 470-473, (2015); Engineering, (2013); Nguyen, Hai Thanh, An autoregressive neural network for recognition of eye commands in an EEG-controlled wheelchair, International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications, pp. 333-338, (2013); Nguyen, Thanh Nghia, A mean threshold algorithm for human eye blinking detection using EEG, IFMBE Proceedings, 40 IFMBE, pp. 275-279, (2013)","Van Toi, V.; Le, T.Q.; Ngo, H.T.; Nguyen, T.-H.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","British Council; et al.; IFMBE; Newton Fund; Springer; VNPT","7th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering in Vietnam, BME 2018","","Ho Chi Minh","226999","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067552904"

Oral administration is more convenient for patients; however, current medications for UC are not effective due to instability in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, non-specific distribution, and adverse effects. To address these issues, we have developed novel oral redox nanoparticles (RNP), which was prepared by self-assembly of an amphiphilic block copolymer with stable nitroxide radicals, ROS scavengers, in a hydrophobic segment as a side chain via an ether linkage. After oral administration, RNP highly accumulated in colon region, and specifically diffused into colonic mucosa of inflamed sites. Orally administered RNP effectively scavenged overproduced ROS in the inflamed colon, resulting in suppression of inflammation in mice model of colitis. Interestingly, when anticancer drug irinotecan (Iri) was administered in combination with RNP, a remarkable suppression of tumor growth was observed in CAC model mice treated with combination compared to mice treated with Iri alone. Iri-induced adverse effects, such as diarrhea and GI inflammation, were remarkably reduced by RNP treatment. Toxicity evaluation on zebrafish embryos showed that TEMPOL induces severe mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the dead of all zebrafish embryos while RNP did not cause mitochondrial dysfunction in zebrafish embryos, and no zebrafish dead was observed, indicating that RNP did not disturb intracelluar redox balance. RNP is a promising nanotherapeutics for treatment of UC and other ROS-related diseases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Oral Drug Delivery; Reactive Oxygen Species; Redox Nanoparticles; Ulcerative Colitis; Biomedical Engineering; Block Copolymers; Developing Countries; Drug Delivery; Mammals; Nanoparticles; Pathology; Self Assembly; Amphiphilic Block Copolymers; Gastrointestinal Tract; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Oral Drug Delivery; Polymeric Nanoparticles; Reactive Oxygen Species; Ulcerative Colitis; Diseases","Biomedical engineering; Block copolymers; Developing countries; Drug delivery; Mammals; Nanoparticles; Pathology; Self assembly; Amphiphilic block copolymers; Gastrointestinal tract; Inflammatory bowel disease; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Oral drug delivery; Polymeric nanoparticles; Reactive oxygen species; Ulcerative colitis; Diseases","","","Acknowledgements Author would like to express his sincere appreciation to Prof. Nagasaki Yukio (University of Tsukuba) and all collaborators for their supports and valuable advices, and funding from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for Young Scientist.

Slow pyrolysis was performed in the temperature range from 400 to 900 °C under various ambient reaction conditions, i.e., non-biochar-oriented conditions (open pyrolysis) and biochar-oriented conditions (closed and N<inf>2</inf>-supported pyrolysis). The resulting changes in micromorphology and different surface properties, specific surface area and surface charge, were elucidated. Open pyrolysis resulted in excessive decomposition of biomass and condensation of silica, while the closed and N<inf>2</inf>-supported pyrolysis methods showed notable enhancement of biochar yield. The presence of silica as an inter-embedded part of the fern D. linearis and the derived biochars likely supported a carbon-silica structural model in which these two components might be integrated or decomposed during pyrolysis. In general, joint processing of organic carbon and silica greatly altered the surface properties. At lower temperatures and during N<inf>2</inf>-supported pyrolysis, condensation of organic compounds limited the development of high surface charge densities. At higher temperatures and during open pyrolysis, intensification of the silica phase was accompanied with an increasing number of charged surface sites, thereby increasing the surface charge density. Based on the porous structure, large surface area (up to 701 m2 g−1) and high surface charge density (up to 0.5 μmol<inf>(−)</inf> m−2), D. linearis-derived biochars can be highlighted as potential agro-environmental materials. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biochar; Fern Dicranopteris Linearis; Pyrolysis; Silica; Surface Properties; Charcoal; Silicon Dioxide; Charge Density; Condensation; Condensation Reactions; Organic Carbon; Silica; Surface Charge; Surface Properties; Tropics; Bio Chars; Environmental Materials; Fern Dicranopteris Linearis; Large Surface Area; Lower Temperatures; Reaction Conditions; Structural Modeling; Subtropical Regions; Pyrolysis; Biochar; Charcoal; Organic Carbon; Organic Compound; Silicon Dioxide; Unclassified Drug; Article; Current Density; Decomposition; Dicranopteris Linearis; Fern; Micromorphology; Polymerization; Priority Journal; Processing; Pyrolysis; Structural Model; Surface Area; Surface Charge; Surface Property; Temperature","Charge density; Condensation; Condensation reactions; Organic carbon; Silica; Surface charge; Surface properties; Tropics; Bio chars; Environmental materials; Fern Dicranopteris linearis; Large surface area; Lower temperatures; Reaction conditions; Structural modeling; Subtropical regions; Pyrolysis; biochar; charcoal; organic carbon; organic compound; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; Article; current density; decomposition; Dicranopteris linearis; fern; micromorphology; polymerization; priority journal; processing; pyrolysis; structural model; surface area; surface charge; surface property; temperature","","charcoal, 16291-96-6; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9","This research was funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 105.08-2018.300 .

In constant TMP mode, flux and organic loading rate dynamically change, while they are rather static in constant flux mode. This study investigated fouling mechanism in MBR under these different filtration modes. Fouling development was more significant in constant TMP mode than in constant flux mode when MBR was operated under an equal flux condition in average. In constant TMP mode, microbial community in cake sludge was distinct from bulk sludge and had higher abundance of biofilm-forming bacterial group. The cake sludge contained more SMP and LB-EPS with high polysaccharide contents in constant TMP mode. These results suggested that, in constant TMP mode, (i) initially high flux in a filtration cycle enhanced initial deposition of bacterial cells and rapid development of fouling layer, which resulted in distinct microbial community in cake sludge; (ii) the high abundance of the biofilm-forming bacteria in cake sludge and fluctuation of organic loading rate stimulated polysaccharide production, (iii) higher polysaccharide contents in cake layer caused faster development of fouling layer and increase of hydraulic resistance by compression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial Community; Bulk Sludge; Cake Sludge; Constant Flux Operation; Extracellular Polymeric Substances; Filtration Mode; Membrane Fouling; Bacteria; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Membrane Fouling; Membranes; Bacterial Community; Bulk Sludge; Cake Sludge; Constant Fluxes; Extra-cellular Polymeric Substances; Filtration Modes; Microfiltration; Bacterial Polysaccharide; Article; Bacterial Cell; Biofouling; Filter Cake; Hydraulic Conductivity; Membrane Resistance; Microbial Community; Nonhuman; Pressure; Priority Journal; Reactor Operation; Sludge; Development; Filtration; Fouling; Loading; Sludge; Thermomechanical Pulps","Bacteria; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Bacterial community; Bulk sludge; Cake sludge; Constant fluxes; Extra-cellular polymeric substances; Filtration modes; Microfiltration; bacterial polysaccharide; Article; bacterial cell; biofouling; filter cake; hydraulic conductivity; membrane resistance; microbial community; nonhuman; pressure; priority journal; reactor operation; sludge; Development; Filtration; Fouling; Loading; Sludge; Thermomechanical Pulps","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists A (Grant No. 15H05535 ), Fostering Joint International Research (Grant No. 16KK0146 ), JST Mirai Program (Grant No. JPMJMI18DC ) and Kurita Water and Environment Foundation.

The behavior of channel connectors is generally determined through conducting experiments. However, these experiments are not only costly but also time-consuming. Moreover, the impact of other parameters cannot be easily seen in the behavior of the connectors. This paper aims to investigate the application of a hybrid artificial neural network-particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) model in the behavior prediction of channel connectors embedded in normal and high-strength concrete (HSC). To generate the required data, an experimental project was conducted. Dimensions of the channel connectors and the compressive strength of concrete were adopted as the inputs of the model, and load and slip were predicted as the outputs. To evaluate the ANN-PSO model, an ANN model was also developed and tuned by a backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm. The results of the paper revealed that an ANN model could properly predict the behavior of channel connectors and eliminate the need for conducting costly experiments to some extent. In addition, in this case, the ANN-PSO model showed better performance than the ANN-BP model by resulting in superior performance indices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network (ann); Behavior Prediction; Channel Shear Connector; High-strength Concrete (hsc); Hybrid Ann-pso; Particle Swarm Optimization (pso)","","","","","Composite Steel and Concrete Structural Members Fundamental Behaviour, (1995); Ghiami Azad, Amir Reza, Large-scale fatigue testing of post-installed shear connectors in partially-composite bridge girders, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 161, pp. 57-69, (2019); Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Steel Structure, (2018); In Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Applied Research in Structural Engineering and Constructional Management, (2019); In Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Steel Structure, (2018); In Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Applied Research in Structural Engineering and Constructional Management, (2019); Shariati, Mahdi, Application of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to design steel-concrete composite floor systems at elevated temperatures, Steel and Composite Structures, 33, 3, pp. 319-332, (2019); Younes, Sherif M., Stiffening of short small-size circular composite steel-concrete columns with shear connectors, Journal of Advanced Research, 7, 3, pp. 525-538, (2016); Shariati, Mahdi, Experimental assessment of channel shear connectors under monotonic and fully reversed cyclic loading in high strength concrete, Materials and Design, 34, pp. 325-331, (2012); Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Steel Composite Structures, (2010)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077734388"

It can also cause faults in interconnection contact systems, yet this kind of effect has not yet been identified and studied in detail. Based on the obtained experimental results, this paper proposes a formation mechanism and model of the mixed-surface nanoscale Kirkendall effect formed by the role of Au metal catalyst islands/strips on a GaAs surface using the thermal Vapor-Liquid-Solid method. The diffusion of Ga, As, O atoms and the absorption of O atoms from a low-vacuum ambient into Au droplets forming surface nanoscale Au/Ga/O clusters leaves behind vacancies and voids; this process results in the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. In addition, the outward diffusion of the surface nanoscale Au/Ga/O clusters leaving behind bare GaAs holes in place of the former Au island forms the surface Kirkendall effect. Consequently, the combination of the two mentioned effects forms a new kind of KE, the so-called Surface Nanoscale Kirkendall Effect. This effect is generated either partly or completely, depending on the technological conditions. Accompanying this effect, the different configurations of nanomaterials have grown in number. The outward diffusion of surface nanoscale Au/Ga/O clusters was caused by the concentration of surface cluster gradients, the weakening of chemical bonds due to the accumulation of vacancies, the porosity, and pit-etching beneath the Au island. The diffusivity of surface Au/Ga/O clusters is numerically estimated. Its values vary from 2 × 10−10 to 10−11 m2/s. Potential applications of the surface nanoscale Kirkendall effect, making use of its advantages, limitations and disadvantages, are also discussed and proposed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Directional Nanomaterials Growth; Gaas; Nanostructured Catalysts; Phase Transfer Catalysis; Surface Nanoscale Au/ga/o Clusters Diffusion; Surface Nanoscale Kirkendall Effect","","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This study was funded by the National Foundation of Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) for the basic research project (103.02.-2017.346) in the 2018–2021 period.; Funding text 2: This study was funded by the National Foundation of Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) for the basic research project (103.02.-2017.346) in the 2018?2021 period.","Trans AIME, (1939); Trans AIME, (1942); Tu, Kingning N., Hollow nanostructures based on the Kirkendall effect: Design and stability considerations, Applied Physics Letters, 86, 9, pp. 1-3, (2005); Fan, Hong Jin, Formation of nanotubes and hollow nanoparticles based on kirkendall and diffusion processes: A review, Small, 3, 10, pp. 1660-1671, (2007); Prasad, Soma, Theoretical consideration on the formation of nanotube following the Kirkendall effect, Applied Physics Letters, 90, 23, (2007); Wang, Wenshou, Hollow nanocrystals through the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, Chemistry of Materials, 25, 8, pp. 1179-1189, (2013); Wagner, R.

Using a narrowing nozzle (constricted nozzle) inside a conventional TIG torch can critically improve the position accuracy of the tungsten electrode and also the arc plasma characteristics and heat input density. In order to evaluate the efficiency of this new torch, weld bead appearance and cross-section images were examined by an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and electron back scatter diffraction patterns (EBSD). The results showed that in all cases, the weld bead profile was stable without undercut and burn-through. Full penetration weld was seen. The width of weld bead on the bottom surface was increased much in comparison to conventional TIG welding. However, the results from SEM and EBSD images indicated that in the case of low welding current, the blowholes were found out on the side of the thinner material (SS400). The penetration of SUS430 material to SS400 material was not good. It seems that no fusion of SUS430 material to SS400 at the bottom surface can be seen. Meanwhile, no blowholes were seen in the case of high welding current. The penetration was better, and the fusion was reached on the bottom surface. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blowhole; Constricted Nozzle; Ebsd; Heat Input; Tig Welding; Welding Thin Sheets","","","","","Int Conf Technol Eng Sci, (2018); Hong, Yuxiang, In-process monitoring of lack of fusion in ultra-thin sheets edge welding using machine vision, Sensors, 18, 8, (2018); Batool, Sadaf, Analysis of weld characteristics of micro-plasma arc welding and tungsten inert gas welding of thin stainless steel (304L) sheet, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 230, 6, pp. 1005-1017, (2016); Transaction of Jwri, (2005); Kang, Namhyun, Effects of gravitational orientation on surface deformation and weld pool geometry during gas tungsten arc welding, Materials and Manufacturing Processes, 18, 2, pp. 169-180, (2003); Int J Electr Mach, (2025); Mochizuki, Masahito, Effect of welding process conditions on angular distortion induced by bead-on-plate welding, ISIJ International, 58, 1, pp. 153-158, (2018); Transactions of Jwri, (2011); undefined; Murata, Akihisa, Development and it's practical application of GTAW automated butt welding equipment for ultra thin sheet, Keikinzoku Yosetsu/Journal of Light Metal Welding, 51, 2, pp. 18-21, (2013)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076461510"

Although salicylic acid (SA) and nitric oxide (NO) are known to have stress mitigating roles, little was explored on how they work together against Cd-toxicity in rice. This study evaluated the individual and combined effects of SA and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a precursor of NO, on Cd-stress tolerance in rice. Results revealed that Cd at toxic concentrations caused rice biomass reduction, which was linked to enhanced accumulation of Cd in roots and leaves, reduced photosynthetic pigment contents, and decreased leaf water status. Cd also potentiated its phytotoxicity by triggering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and depleting several non-enzymatic and enzymatic components in rice leaves. In contrast, SA and/or SNP supplementation with Cd resulted in growth recovery, as evidenced by greater biomass content, improved leaf water content, and protection of photosynthetic pigments. These signaling molecules were particularly effective in restricting Cd uptake and accumulation, with the highest effect being observed in “SA + SNP + Cd” plants. SA and/or SNP alleviated Cd-induced oxidative damage by reducing ROS accumulation and malondialdehyde production through the maintenance of ascorbate and glutathione levels, and redox status, as well as the better activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase. Combined effects of SA and SNP were observed to be more prominent in Cd-stress mitigation than the individual effects of SA followed by that of SNP, suggesting that SA and NO in combination more efficiently boosted physiological and biochemical responses to alleviate Cd-toxicity than either SA or NO alone. This finding signifies a cooperative action of SA and NO in mitigating Cd-induced adverse effects in rice, and perhaps in other crop plants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cadmium Toxicity;

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach between adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and various meta-heuristic optimizations such as the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the firefly algorithm (FA) to develop several hybrid models namely GA based ANGIS (GANFIS), PSO based ANFIS (PSOANFIS), FA based ANFIS (FAANFIS), respectively, for the prediction of the IRI. A benchmark model named artificial neural networks (ANN) was also used to compare with those hybrid models. To do this, a total of 2811 samples in the case study of the north of Vietnam (Northwest region, Northeast region, and the Red River Delta Area) within the scope of management of the DRM-I Department were used to validate the models in terms of various criteria like coefficient of determination (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE). Experimental results affirmed the potentiality and effectiveness of the proposed prediction models whereas the PSOANFIS (RMSE = 0.145 and R = 0.888) is better than the other models named GANFIS (RMSE = 0.155 and R = 0.872), FAANFIS (RMSE = 0.170 and R = 0.849), and ANN (RMSE = 0.186 and R = 0.804).

As a function of ten key factors of the soil (including depth of the sample, percentage of sand, percentage of loam, percentage of clay, percentage of moisture content, wet density, liquid limit, plastic limit, plastic Index, and liquidity index), the SSS was considered as the response variable. Followed by development of the ALO-ANN and SHO-ANN ensembles, the best-fitted structures were determined by a trial and error process. The results demonstrated the efficiency of both applied algorithms, as the prediction error of the ANN was reduced by around 35% and 18% by the ALO and SHO, respectively.

Many types of research have shown that ANNs are valuable techniques for estimating the bearing capacity of the soils. However, most ANN training models have some drawbacks. This study aimed to focus on the application of two well-known hybrid ICA-ANN and PSO-ANN models to the estimation of bearing capacity of the circular footing lied in layered soils. In order to provide the training and testing datasets for the predictive network models, extensive finite element (FE) modelling (a database includes 2810 training datasets and 703 testing datasets) are performed on 16 soil layer sets (weaker soil rested on stronger soil and vice versa). Note that all the independent variables of ICA and PSO algorithms are optimized utilizing a trial and error method. The input includes upper layer thickness/foundation width (h/B) ratio, footing width (B), top and bottom soil layer properties (e.g., six of the most critical soil characteristics), vertical settlement of circular footing (s), where the output was taken ultimate bearing capacity of the circular footing (F<inf>ult</inf>).

A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis assigned the strain to genus Paenibacillus. The optimum growth temperature of strain 4B1 was 45°C with a doubling time of 2.7 h in the presence of DF as a sole carbon and energy source. The rate of its growth and DF-degradation were approximately 3-fold higher than those of a reference Paenibacillus sp. strain. The 4B1 strain degraded 89% of 1000 mg L−1 DF within 48 h cultivation at the optimum temperature. TBLASTN analysis based on its draft genome sequence revealed that this strain possessed a dbf gene cluster. The open reading frames (dbfA1A2RBC) in the cluster shared 99–100% identity with those of Paenibacillus sp. YK5, indicating that DF was likely degraded by an angular dioxygenation pathway in strain 4B1. Four genes in the dbf gene cluster (dbfA1A2BC) were partially induced by DF, which was observed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative PCR analysis of dbfA1 transcripts, encoding the alpha subunit of DF dioxygenase, indicated that dbfA1 was expressed 4-times higher than that of strain YK5 at 45°C. These results suggest that the faster growth and degradation of DF in strain 4B1 could be due to differences in transcriptional regulation of dbf cluster genes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradation; Dbf Genes; Dibenzofuran; Moderate Thermophilic; Paenibacillus; Dibenzofuran; Dibenzofurans; Dioxins; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Soil; Biodegradation; Organic Pollutants; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna; Soil Pollution; Dibenzofurans; Isolation And Characterization; Moderate Thermophilic; Optimum Growth Temperature; Paenibacillus; Semi-quantitative Rt-pcr; Thermophilic Conditions; Transcriptional Regulation; Genes; Dibenzofuran; Dioxin; Rna 16s; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Growth; Bacterium Isolation; Bioremediation; Coculture; Dbf Gene; Gene Cluster; Gene Sequence; Genetic Code; Genetic Transcription; Genome; Nonhuman; Paenibacillus Naphthalenovorans; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Soil; Soil Pollution; Viet Nam; Bacterial Genome; Drug Effect; Genetics; Isolation And Purification; Metabolism; Microbiology; Multigene Family; Nucleotide Sequence; Open Reading Frame; Base Sequence; Dioxins; Genome, Bacterial; Multigene Family; Open Reading Frames; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Vietnam","Biodegradation; Organic pollutants; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Soil pollution; Dibenzofurans; Isolation and characterization; Moderate thermophilic; Optimum growth temperature; Paenibacillus; Semi-quantitative RT-PCR; Thermophilic conditions; Transcriptional regulation; Genes; dibenzofuran; dioxin; RNA 16S; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterium isolation; bioremediation; coculture; dbf gene; gene cluster; gene sequence; genetic code; genetic transcription; genome; nonhuman; Paenibacillus naphthalenovorans; real time polymerase chain reaction; soil; soil pollution; Viet Nam; bacterial genome; drug effect; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; multigene family; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; Base Sequence; Dioxins; Genome, Bacterial; Multigene Family; Open Reading Frames; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Vietnam","","dibenzofuran, 132-64-9; Dibenzofurans; Dioxins; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil","Funding text 1: We are very grateful to Prof. Dr. Stefano Ferri for his support and discussion.

Owing to their adverse side effects and narrow therapeutic index, monitoring blood levels of aminoglycosides is important to maximize their effectiveness and minimize their toxicity. Current monitoring techniques require a well-equipped diagnostic laboratory. The present study aimed to present a proof-of-concept for a simple, low-cost biochemical assay utilizing a paper platform for the detection of serum/whole blood aminoglycosides. A paper-based bioassay chip for the assay was developed by spotting and freeze-drying cell-free transcription/translation reaction machinery for a luminescent reporter protein (NanoLuc) within an array of wax circles printed on filter paper. The paper-based chip could be used to quantify serum/whole blood aminoglycosides within clinically relevant concentrations in 30–60 min by spotting minimal volumes of samples, followed by the NanoLuc substrate, in the wax circles and detecting the associated changes in luminescence signals, using a simple digital camera. Furthermore, a one-pot assay in which cell-free transcription/translation reaction machinery and NanoLuc substrate are mixed in advance and embedded in paper could be used to detect an aminoglycoside in serum. Overall, our paper-based bioassay can potentially provide a basic platform for the simple and low-cost therapeutic monitoring of aminoglycosides, especially in resource-limited regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aminoglycoside; Cell-free Protein Synthesis; Digital Camera; Luminescence; Paper Platform Assay; Therapeutic Drug Monitoring; Amikacin; Chloramphenicol; Erythromycin; Gentamicin; Paromomycin; Tetracycline; Tobramycin; Wax; Aminoglycosides; Anti-bacterial Agents; Biosynthesis; Blood; Costs; Digital Cameras; Luminescence; Machinery; Patient Monitoring; Proteins; Transcription; Video Cameras; Adverse Side Effects; Aminoglycosides; Cell Free Protein Synthesis; Current Monitoring; Luminescence Signals; Ribosomal Subunits; Therapeutic Drug Monitoring; Therapeutic Monitoring; Bioassay; Amikacin; Aminoglycoside Derivative; Chloramphenicol; Erythromycin; Gentamicin; Paromomycin; Tetracycline; Tobramycin; Wax; Aminoglycoside; Antiinfective Agent; Article; Drug Determination; Drug Monitoring; Luminescence; Proof Of Concept; Quantitative Analysis; Systematic Review; Blood; Blood Analysis; Genetic Procedures; Human; Limit Of Detection; Paper; Procedures; Time Factor; Anti-bacterial Agents; Biosensing Techniques; Blood Chemical Analysis; Drug Monitoring; Humans; Limit Of Detection; Luminescent Measurements; Paper; Time Factors","Biosynthesis; Blood; Costs; Digital cameras; Luminescence; Machinery; Patient monitoring; Proteins; Transcription; Video cameras; Adverse side effects; Aminoglycosides; Cell free protein synthesis; Current monitoring; Luminescence signals; Ribosomal subunits; Therapeutic drug monitoring; Therapeutic monitoring; Bioassay; amikacin; aminoglycoside derivative; chloramphenicol; erythromycin; gentamicin; paromomycin; tetracycline; tobramycin; wax; aminoglycoside; antiinfective agent; Article; drug determination; drug monitoring; luminescence; proof of concept; quantitative analysis; systematic review; blood; blood analysis; genetic procedures; human; limit of detection; paper; procedures; time factor; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biosensing Techniques; Blood Chemical Analysis; Drug Monitoring; Humans; Limit of Detection; Luminescent Measurements; Paper; Time Factors","","amikacin, 37517-28-5, 39831-55-5; chloramphenicol, 134-90-7, 2787-09-9, 56-75-7; erythromycin, 114-07-8, 70536-18-4; gentamicin, 1392-48-9, 1403-66-3, 1405-41-0; paromomycin, 11035-13-5, 1263-89-4, 1390-73-4, 51795-47-2, 54597-56-7, 7542-37-2, 84420-34-8; tetracycline, 23843-90-5, 60-54-8, 64-75-5, 8021-86-1; tobramycin, 32986-56-4; wax, 83062-05-9; Aminoglycosides; Anti-Bacterial Agents","We thank the Biological Resource Center in the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NBRC, Japan) for providing E. coli phage T3.

Out of seven basidiomycete species, Ganoderma applanatum displayed the highest antimicrobial properties against the tested pathogens. Thus, G. applanatum methanol crude extract was fractionated using column chromatography, and the obtained fractions were subjected to an antimicrobial assay followed by phytochemical analyses using high-performance liquid chromatography to select the best fraction for synthesis of AgNPs. Fraction 3 displayed potent antimicrobial activities as evidenced by its high phenolic content, and thus was used for AgNP biosynthesis. The G. applanatum fraction 3-synthesized AgNPs were then characterized using various microscopy, spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The characteristic features of the synthesized AgNPs indicated the spherical shape of AgNPs with an average size of 20–25 nm. The synthesized AgNPs exhibit high antioxidant capacity, in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and in vivo antifungal properties against Botrytis cinerea and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in tomato and strawberry leaflet assays, respectively.

This paper investigates the efficiency of a novel optimizer, namely ant lion optimization (ALO), for fine-tuning of a neural network (NN) in the field of concrete slump prediction. Two well-known optimization techniques, biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), are also considered as benchmark models to be compared with ALO. Considering seven slump effective factors, namely cement, slag, water, fly ash, superplasticizer (SP), fine aggregate (FA), and coarse aggregate (CA), the mentioned algorithms are synthesized with a neural network to determine the best-fitted neural parameters. The most appropriate complexity of each ensemble is also found by a population-based sensitivity analysis. The findings revealed that the proposed ALO-NN model acquires a good approximation of concrete slump, regarding the calculated root mean square error (RMSE = 3.7788) and mean absolute error (MAE = 3.0286). It also outperformed both BBO-NN (RMSE = 4.1859 and MAE = 3.3465) and GOA-NN (RMSE = 4.9553 and MAE = 3.8576) ensembles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ant Lion Optimizer; Concrete; Neural Computing; Slump","","","","The APC was funded by the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence > Project (AIP), Japan.","Journal of Al Azhar University Engineering Sector, (2016); Yeh, I-Cheng Cheng, Modeling slump flow of concrete using second-order regressions and artificial neural networks, Cement and Concrete Composites, 29, 6, pp. 474-480, (2007); Antiohos, Stelios K., Rice husk ash (RHA) effectiveness in cement and concrete as a function of reactive silica and fineness, Cement and Concrete Research, 61-62, pp. 20-27, (2014); McCulloch, Warren S., A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity, The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, 5, 4, pp. 115-133, (1943); Eng Comput, (2019); Eng Comput, (2017); Govindaraju, Rao S., Artificial neural networks in hydrology.

However, it is complicated for process planners to choose the optimal cutting tool when faced with the choice of multiple cutting tools, multiple conflict criteria, and uncertain information. This paper presents an effective method for automatically selecting a cutting tool based on the machining feature characteristics. The optimal cutting tool type is first selected using a proposed multicriteria decision-making method with integrated fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The inputs of this process are the feature dimensions, workpiece stability, feature quality, specific machining type, and tool access direction, which determine the cutting tool type priority after evaluating many criteria, such as the material removal capacity, tool cost, power requirement, and flexibility. Expert judgments on the criteria or attributes are collected to determine their weights. The cutting tool types are ranked in ascending order by priority. Then, the rule-based method is applied to determine other specific characteristics of the cutting tool. Cutting tool data are collected from world-leading cutting tool manufacturer, Sandvik, among others.

Differentiated embryonic chondrocyte gene 1 (Dec1), a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor, has circadian expression in the heart; however, its role in cardiac diseases remains unknown. Therefore, using Dec1 knock-out (Dec1KO) and wild-type (WT) mice, we evaluated cardiac function and morphology at one and four weeks after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery. We found that Dec1KO mice retained cardiac function until four weeks after TAC. Dec1KO mice also revealed more severely hypertrophic hearts than WT mice at four weeks after TAC, whereas no significant change was observed at one week. An increase in Dec1 expression was found in myocardial and stromal cells of TAC-treated WT mice. In addition, Dec1 circadian expression was disrupted in the heart of TAC-treated WT mice. Cardiac perivascular fibrosis was suppressed in TAC-treated Dec1KO mice, with positive immunostaining of S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1), phosphorylation of Smad family member 3 (pSmad3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and cyclin-interacting protein 1 (p21). Furthermore, Dec1 expression was increased in myocardial hypertrophy and myocardial infarction of autopsy cases. Taken together, our results indicate that Dec1 deficiency suppresses cardiac fibrosis, preserving cardiac function in hypertrophic hearts. We suggest that Dec1 could be a new therapeutic target in cardiac fibrosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cardiac Fibrosis; Dec1; Immunohistochemistry; S100a4; Αsma; Protein P21; Smad3 Protein; Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin; Calvasculin; Protein P21; Smad3 Protein; Transforming Growth Factor Beta1; Tumor Necrosis Factor; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Aortic Constriction; Article; Autopsy; Cardiac Muscle Cell; Cardiac Perivascular Fibrosis; Circadian Rhythm; Controlled Study; Differentiated Embryonic Chondrocyte Gene 1; Gene; Gene Expression Level; Heart Function; Heart Infarction; Heart Muscle Fibrosis; Heart Ventricle Hypertrophy; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Mouse; Nonhuman; Protein Phosphorylation; Stroma Cell; Transverse Aortic Constriction","alpha smooth muscle actin; calvasculin; protein p21; Smad3 protein; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aortic constriction; Article; autopsy; cardiac muscle cell; cardiac perivascular fibrosis; circadian rhythm; controlled study; differentiated embryonic chondrocyte gene 1; gene; gene expression level; heart function; heart infarction; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle hypertrophy; immunohistochemistry; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; stroma cell; transverse aortic constriction","","protein p21, 85306-28-1; Smad3 protein, 237417-78-6, 237417-96-8, 237418-00-7","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16K09624 (F.S.), and by a Nihon University Multidisciplinary Research Grant for 2018 (U.K.B).

In this study, porous polystyrene (PS) fibers with high hydrophobicity and superoleophilicity were directly fabricated by a centrifugal spinning method (CS). The effect of solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide (DMF) on the morphology and porous structure of the polystyrene fibers was evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments. The formation mechanism for the porous structure on the fibers was also evaluated. The oil sorption capacities of the PS fibers for silicon oil, pump oil, and vegetable oil were investigated. The highest oil sorption capacity was found in PS fibers fabricated from PS solution with a THF/DMF weight ratio of 1/3, which exhibited the highest specific surface area, pore volume, and porosity. The high productivity and highly porous structure of PS fibers indicate that CS is a promising method to fabricate porous fibers for the cleanup of oil spills. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","K.K. acknowledges the research support from a JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) (No. 16H06118).

The results show that draw solution chemistry could induce a notable impact on both water flux and TrOCs rejection. In addition, the impact was further influenced by membrane fouling. The reverse flux of proton (or hydroxyl) could alter the feed solution pH, which governed the separation of ionisable TrOCs. In addition, charged compounds generally exhibited higher rejections than neutral ones by the clean membrane. Electrostatic interaction, rather than size exclusion, was therefore the dominant rejection mechanism for most compounds. There was also a weak correlation between rejection and molecular sizes of the 43 TrOCs. Compared with Na+, Li+ with a larger hydrated radius showed a significantly lower reverse salt flux, resulting in a lower ionic strength and therefore a stronger electrostatic interaction. A fouling cake layer consisted of low molecular weight neutral organics could also affect TrOC rejection due to pore blockage and cake-enhanced concentration polarisation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forward Osmosis; Membrane Fouling; Reverse Salt Flux; Trace Organic Contaminants; Wastewater; Lithium Ion; Sodium Ion; Electrostatic Separators; Electrostatics; Ionic Strength; Membrane Fouling; Wastewater; Charged Compounds; Concentration Polarisation; Forward Osmosis; Low Molecular Weight; Rejection Mechanisms; Salt Flux; Trace Organic Contaminants; Weak Correlation; Osmosis; Lithium Ion; Sodium Ion; Article; Biofouling; Body Weight Change; Cell Membrane; Conductance; Ionic Strength; Molecular Size; Molecular Weight; Osmosis; Ph; Priority Journal; Sewage; Solute; Static Electricity; Waste Water Management; Chemistry; Fouling; Impact; Ionic Strength; Ph; Rejection","Electrostatic separators; Electrostatics; Ionic strength; Membrane fouling; Wastewater; Charged compounds; Concentration polarisation; Forward osmosis; Low molecular weight; Rejection mechanisms; Salt flux; Trace organic contaminants; Weak correlation; Osmosis; lithium ion; sodium ion; Article; biofouling; body weight change; cell membrane; conductance; ionic strength; molecular size; molecular weight; osmosis; pH; priority journal; sewage; solute; static electricity; waste water management; Chemistry; Fouling; Impact; Ionic Strength; Ph; Rejection","","lithium ion, 17341-24-1; sodium ion, 17341-25-2","This research is supported by the Australian Research Council through the ARC Research Hub for Energy-efficient Separation ( IH170100009 ).

Furthermore, in silico studies suggest complex regulatory networks among these genes. Drosophila is a useful genetic model system for studies of ASD and ASD-related syndromes to clarify the in vivo roles of ASD-associated genes and the complex gene regulatory networks operating in the pathogenesis of ASD and ASD-related syndromes.

Thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is one of the mainstream treatments, but it still has many problems, including short half-life, and t-PA-induced reperfusion and oxidative injuries. To broaden the therapeutic window of t-PA and reduce its associated oxidative stress after reperfusion, t-PA-installed, nitroxide radical-containing, self-assembled polyion complex nanoparticles (t-PA@iRNP) were designed. Encapsulation of t-PA in the self-assembled antioxidant nanoparticles improved its bioavailability and extended its therapeutic window. To suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ischemic penumbra area, the low-molecular-weight nitroxide antioxidant 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl was covalently conjugated with the nanoparticle matrix, thus suppressing oxidative damage in the brain after reperfusion. t-PA and nitroxide radicals were confined and protected in the core of t-PA@iRNP, thereby preventing their rapid metabolism and excretion out of the body after systemic circulation for prolonged period. The nano-sized formulation prevented non-specific internalization of t-PA@iRNP in healthy cells, thereby preserving the normal function of redox reactions in the cells, especially important redox reactions such as electron transport chains. This improved pharmacological performance of t-PA@iRNP remarkably extended the in vivo half-life of t-PA in systemic circulation. Using a mouse model of photo-thrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion, we found that t-PA@iRNP treatment, compared with naked t-PA, void iRNP, or t-PA@niRNP (non-ROS scavenging nanoparticle as a control), significantly suppressed increases in cerebral infarct volume and improved neurological deficit after brain ischemia. t-PA-induced subarachnoid hemorrhage was also suppressed by t-PA@iRNP treatment through elimination of overproduced ROS. Based on these data, t-PA@iRNP presents therapeutic potential through synergistic effect of thrombolysis and antioxidant effects for preventing and treating ischemia-reperfusion injury. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hemorrhagic Transformation; Ischemia-reperfusion Treatment; Ischemic Stroke; Reactive Oxygen Species (ros); Redox Nanoparticles; Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-pa); Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Superoxide; Antioxidants; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxides; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Antioxidants; Biochemistry; Brain; Drug Therapy; Electron Transport Properties; Image Enhancement; Molecular Oxygen; Nanoparticles; Tissue; Hemorrhagic Transformation; Ischemia Reperfusion; Ischemic Strokes; Reactive Oxygen Species; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Redox Reactions; 4 Amino 2,2,6,6 Tetramethylpiperidine 1 Oxyl; Antioxidant; Nanoparticle; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Unclassified Drug; Superoxide; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Brain Ischemia; Controlled Study; Drug Blood Level; Drug Half Life; Drug Megadose; Fibrinolytic Therapy; In Vivo Study; Infant; Infarct Volume; Internalization; Low Drug Dose; Male; Mouse; Nanoencapsulation; Nonhuman; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Oxidative Stress; Ph; Priority Journal; Respiratory Chain; Animal; Cerebral Artery Disease; Chemistry; Disease Model; Drug Effect; Lipid Peroxidation; Metabolism; Procedures; Reperfusion Injury; Animals; Brain Ischemia; Disease Models, Animal; Hydrogen-ion Concentration; Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Mice; Oxidation-reduction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reperfusion Injury; Superoxides; Thrombolytic Therapy; Tissue Plasminogen Activator","Antioxidants; Biochemistry; Brain; Drug therapy; Electron transport properties; Image enhancement; Molecular oxygen; Nanoparticles; Tissue; Hemorrhagic transformation; Ischemia reperfusion; Ischemic strokes; Reactive oxygen species; Tissue plasminogen activator; Redox reactions; 4 amino 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl; antioxidant; nanoparticle; reactive oxygen metabolite; tissue plasminogen activator; unclassified drug; superoxide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain ischemia; controlled study; drug blood level; drug half life; drug megadose; fibrinolytic therapy; in vivo study; infant; infarct volume; internalization; low drug dose; male; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; pH; priority journal; respiratory chain; animal; cerebral artery disease; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; lipid peroxidation; metabolism; procedures; reperfusion injury; Animals; Brain Ischemia; Disease Models, Animal; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Mice; Oxidation-Reduction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reperfusion Injury; Superoxides; Thrombolytic Therapy; Tissue Plasminogen Activator","","tissue plasminogen activator, 105913-11-9; superoxide, 11062-77-4; Antioxidants; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxides; Tissue Plasminogen Activator","","Moskowitz, Michael A., The science of stroke: Mechanisms in search of treatments, Neuron, 67, 2, pp. 181-198, (2010); Marso, Steven P., Liraglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes, New England Journal of Medicine, 375, 4, pp. 311-322, (2016); Nilsson, Torbjörn K., In vivo metabolism of human tissue-type plasminogen activator, Scandinavian Journal of Haematology, 33, 1, pp. 49-53, (1984); Larrue, Vincent, Risk factors for severe hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator: A secondary analysis of the European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II), Stroke, 32, 2, pp. 438-441, (2001); Kanazawa, Masato, Therapeutic strategies to attenuate hemorrhagic transformation after tissue plasminogen activator treatment for acute ischemic stroke, Journal of Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis, 24, 3, pp. 240-253, (2017); Granger, Daniel Neil, Reperfusion injury and reactive oxygen species: The evolution of a concept, Redox Biology, 6, pp. 524-551, (2015); Andersen, Julie K., Oxidative stress in neurodegeneration: Cause or consequence?, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 10, 7, (2004); Jin, Rong, Inflammatory mechanisms in ischemic stroke: Role of inflammatory cells, Journal of Leukocyte Biology, 87, 5, pp. 779-789, (2010); Faraci, Frank M., Reactive oxygen species: Influence on cerebral vascular tone, Journal of Applied Physiology, 100, 2, pp. 739-743, (2006); El-Sherbiny, Ibrahim Mohamed, Tissue plasminogen activator-based clot busting: Controlled delivery approaches, Global Cardiology Science and Practice, 2014, 3, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01429612; 18785905","9781119043553; 9781848215856","BIMAD","31181394","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067313372"

Herein, we chemically grew a conductive polymer (polypyrrole, PPy) on graphene-supported manganese ferrite microspheres (MG, ∼344 nm in size) to form PPy/MG hybrids at various PPy contents (20, 33.3, and 42.9 wt%). PPy, MG binary, and PPy/MG ternary hybrids were comprehensively characterized to correlate their structure, morphology, and properties. Electrochemical measurements revealed a significantly enhancement of capacitive performances of PPy/MG as comparison to those of each component. Consequently, the combination of PPy and MG resulted in maximum specific capacitance of 147.2 F/g at scan rate of 10 mV/s or 66.1 F/g at current density of 0.5 A/g. These synergistic and cooperative effects are attributed to reduced diffusion resistance in the PPy/MG hybrids. This work thus suggests an efficient strategy to develop high-performance material for supercapacitor electrode. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graphene Oxide; Mnfe2o4; Polypyrrole; Supercapacitor; Synergistic Effect; Ternary Hybrids; Dissimilar Materials; Electrodes; Graphene; Graphene Oxide; Polypyrroles; Capacitive Performance; Electrochemical Measurements; High Performance Material; Mnfe2o4; Specific Capacitance; Supercapacitor Electrodes; Synergistic Effect; Ternary Hybrid; Supercapacitor","Dissimilar materials; Electrodes; Graphene; Graphene oxide; Polypyrroles; Capacitive performance; Electrochemical measurements; High performance material; MnFe2O4; Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor electrodes; Synergistic effect; Ternary hybrid; Supercapacitor","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development ( NAFOSTED ) under grant number 103.02–2015.100 .

By using a Head-Mounted Display, 360-degree video can render a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. However, it is still a big challenge to understand Quality of Experience (QoE) of 360-degree video since user experience during watching 360-degree video is a very complex phenomenon. In this paper, we aim to investigate four QoE aspects of 360-degree video, namely, perceptual quality, presence, cybersickness, and acceptability. In addition, four key QoE-affecting factors of encoding parameters, content motion, rendering device, and rendering mode are considered in our study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that covers a large number of factors and QoE aspects of 360-degree video. In this study, a subjective experiment is conducted using 60 video versions generated from three original 360-degree videos. Based on statistical analysis of the obtained results, various findings on the impacts of the factors on the QoE aspects are provided. In particular, regarding the impacts of encoding parameters, it is found that the difference of QoE is negligible between video versions encoded at 4 K and 2.5 K resolutions. Also, it is suggested that 360-degree video should not be encoded at HD resolution or lower when watching in VR mode using Head Mounted Display. In addition, the bitrate for good QoE varies widely across different video contents. With respect to the content motion factor, its impact is statistically significant on the perceptual quality, presence, and cybersickness. In a comparison of two rendering device sets used in this study, there is no statistically significant difference found for the acceptability and cybersickness. However, the differences of the perceptual quality and presence are indicated to be statistically significant. Regarding the rendering mode, a comparison between VR and non-VR modes is also conducted. Although the non-VR mode always achieves higher perceptual quality scores and higher acceptability rates, more than a half of the viewers prefer the VR mode to the non-VR mode when watching versions encoded at the resolutions of fHD or higher. By contrast, the non-VR mode is preferred at the HD resolution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","360-degree Video; Quality Of Experience; Subjective Experiment; Virtual Reality","","","","Funding: This work was supported in part by the Competitive Fund No. P-11 of the University of Aizu.","Nguyen, Duc V., An Optimal Tile-Based Approach for Viewport-Adaptive 360-Degree Video Streaming, IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, 9, 1, pp. 29-42, (2019); Nguyen, Duc V., A client-based adaptation framework for 360-degree video streaming, Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 59, pp. 231-243, (2019); Hosseini, Mohammad, Adaptive 360 VR video streaming: Divide and conquer!, pp. 107-110, (2017); Liu, Yao, Deriving and Validating User Experience Model for DASH Video Streaming, IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting, 61, 4, pp. 651-665, (2015); Seufert, Michael, YouTube QoE on mobile devices: Subjective analysis of classical vs. adaptive video streaming, pp. 43-48, (2015); Spachos, Petros, Acceptability and Quality of Experience in over the top video, pp. 1693-1698, (2015); Tran, Huyen T.T., A Cumulative Quality Model for HTTP Adaptive Streaming, (2018); Song, Wei, Acceptability-based QoE models for mobile video, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 16, 3, pp. 738-750, (2014); Song, Wei, Saving Bitrate vs. Pleasing Users: Where is the break-even point in mobile video quality?, pp. 403-412, (2011); Tran, Huyen T.T., A novel quality model for HTTP adaptive streaming, pp. 423-428, (2016)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070913940"

Although its roles in lipid metabolism in adipocyte tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver, and as a transcriptional co-activator are known, its functions during development are still under investigation. In this study, we analyzed the role of Drosophila lipin (dLipin) in development. Specifically, we showed that the tissue-selective knockdown of dLipin in the wing pouch led to an atrophied wing. Elevated DNA damage was observed in the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies. dLipin dysfunction induced accumulation of cells in S phase and significantly reduced the number of mitotic cells, indicating DNA damage-induced activation of the G2/M checkpoint. Reduced expression of cyclin B, which is critical for the G2 to M transition, was observed in the margin of the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies. The knockdown of dLipin led to increased apoptotic cell death in the wing imaginal disc. Thus, our results suggest that dLipin is involved in DNA replication during normal cell cycle progression in wing development of Drosophila melanogaster. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cell Cycle; Dna Damage; Drosophila; Lipin; Wing Development; Cyclin B; Drosophila Proteins; Lpin Protein, Drosophila; Fv10i; Lightcycler 96; Cyclin B; Death Associated Inhibitor Of Apoptosis 1; Histone H2a; Lipin; Peptides And Proteins; Reaper Protein; Ribosomal Protein 49; Triacylglycerol; Unclassified Drug; Drosophila Protein; Lpin Protein, Drosophila; Animal Tissue; Apoptosis; Article; Cell Cycle Progression; Cell Death; Controlled Study; Development; Dna Damage; Dna Replication; Down Regulation; Drosophila Melanogaster; Female; Fluorescence Microscopy; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoint; Gene Expression Level; Gene Knockdown; Gene Sequence; Genetic Variability; Genotype; Immunohistochemistry; Larva; Lipid Diet; Male; Nonhuman; Percentage Of Cells In S Phase; Phenotype; Protein Expression; Protein Function; Protein Localization; Protein Phosphorylation; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Starvation; Wing; Animal; Cell Cycle S Phase; Cell Division; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Imaginal Disc; Metabolism; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Division; Cyclin B; Dna Damage; Down-regulation; Drosophila Proteins; Female; Imaginal Discs; Male; S Phase; Wings, Animal","cyclin B; death associated inhibitor of apoptosis 1; histone H2A; lipin; peptides and proteins; reaper protein; ribosomal protein 49; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; Drosophila protein; Lpin protein, Drosophila; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cell cycle progression; cell death; controlled study; development; DNA damage; DNA replication; down regulation; Drosophila melanogaster; female; fluorescence microscopy; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression level; gene knockdown; gene sequence; genetic variability; genotype; immunohistochemistry; larva; lipid diet; male; nonhuman; percentage of cells in S phase; phenotype; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; starvation; wing; animal; cell cycle S phase; cell division; genetics; growth, development and aging; imaginal disc; metabolism; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Division; Cyclin B; DNA Damage; Down-Regulation; Drosophila Proteins; Female; Imaginal Discs; Male; S Phase; Wings, Animal","","Cyclin B; Drosophila Proteins; Lpin protein, Drosophila","Funding: This work was partially supported by Grants-in-Aid from the JSPS Core-to-Core program, B.

It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings' energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings' energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heating Load; Hybrid Model; Meta-heuristic Algorithm; Smart Building; Smart City","","","","","Smart City, (2014); Anthopoulos, Leonidas G., Understanding the smart city domain: A literature review, pp. 9-21, (2015); Caragliu, Andrea, Smart cities in Europe, Journal of Urban Technology, 18, 2, pp. 65-82, (2011); Bibri, Simon Elias, Smart sustainable cities of the future: An extensive interdisciplinary literature review, Sustainable Cities and Society, 31, pp. 183-212, (2017); Talari, Saber, A review of smart cities based on the internet of things concept, Energies, 10, 4, (2017); Silva, Bhagya Nathali, Towards sustainable smart cities: A review of trends, architectures, components, and open challenges in smart cities, Sustainable Cities and Society, 38, pp. 697-713, (2018); Esmaeilian, Behzad, The future of waste management in smart and sustainable cities: A review and concept paper, Waste Management, 81, pp. 177-195, (2018); Martin, Chris J., Smart and sustainable?

The pumping performance is applicable for commercialized counterparts while the homogeneous medium was obtained at downstream in the experiments, which was further confirmed by simulation.

PAM-based applications must overcome two inherent drawbacks. The first is the nonlinearity due to the compressibility of the air, and the second is the hysteresis due to its geometric construction. Because of these drawbacks, it is difficult to construct not only an accurate mathematical model but also a high-performance control scheme. In this paper, the discrete-time fractional order integral sliding mode control approach is investigated to deal with the drawbacks of PAMs. First, a discrete-time second order plus dead time mathematical model is chosen to approximate the characteristics of PAMs in the antagonistic configuration. Then, the fractional order integral sliding mode control approach is employed together with a disturbance observer to improve the trajectory tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified in multi-scenario experiments using a physical actuator. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antagonistic Actuator; Fractional Calculus; Pneumatic Artificial Muscle; Sliding Mode Control","","","","","Banala, Sai K., Robot assisted gait training with active leg exoskeleton (ALEX), IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 17, 1, pp. 2-8, (2009); Beyl, Pieter, Safe and compliant guidance by a powered knee exoskeleton for robot-assisted rehabilitation of gait, Advanced Robotics, 25, 5, pp. 513-535, (2011); Dao, Quy Thinh, Assist-as-needed control of a robotic orthosis actuated by pneumatic artificial muscle for gait rehabilitation, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 8, 4, (2018); Hussain, Shahid, Control of a robotic orthosis for gait rehabilitation, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 61, 9, pp. 911-919, (2013); Reynolds, David B., Modeling the dynamic characteristics of pneumatic muscle, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 31, 3, pp. 310-317, (2003); Xing, Kexin, Tracking control of pneumatic artificial muscle actuators based on sliding mode and non-linear disturbance observer, IET Control Theory and Applications, 4, 10, pp. 2058-2070, (2010); Lilly, John H., A two-input sliding-mode controller for a planar arm actuated by four pneumatic muscle groups, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 12, 3, pp. 349-359, (2004); Lilly, John H., Sliding mode tracking for pneumatic muscle actuators in opposing pair configuration, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 13, 4, pp. 550-558, (2005); Choi, Taeyong, Control of manipulator using pneumatic muscles for enhanced safety, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 57, 8, pp. 2815-2825, (2010); Choi, Taeyong, Position and compliance control of a pneumatic muscle actuated manipulator for enhanced safety, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 19, 4, pp. 832-842, (2011)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068162650"

The effects of chemical interactions between CQDs and PVA matrix on the changes in optical properties of CQDs or physicochemical properties of PVA are yet to be investigated fully. Herein, we first synthesized CQDs with different surface chemistry via varying the molar ratio between citric acid (CA) and ethylenediamine and then embedded the CQDs into PVA with or without additional CA crosslinking. Infrared and UV–vis studies on CQDs and composites showed that condensation between CQDs and PVA induced a redshift in the absorption peak originating from CQDs’ surface fluorophore groups. Interestingly, CA crosslinking significantly increased the water resistance, but it quenched the photoluminescence of composites. The quenching effects were reduced by using CQDs having less reactivity with CA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemical Interactions; Optical Changes; Polymer Matrix; Surface Acidity; Surface Fluorophore; Carbon; Fluorophores; Molar Ratio; Nanocrystals; Optical Properties; Photoluminescence; Physicochemical Properties; Polymer Matrix; Polyvinyl Alcohols; Quenching; Semiconductor Quantum Dots; Surface Chemistry; Chemical Interactions; Optical Changes; Photoluminescence Quenching; Poly (vinyl Alcohol) (pva); Quantum-dot Composites; Surface Acidity; Water-resistances; Water-soluble Carbons; Crosslinking","Carbon; Fluorophores; Molar ratio; Nanocrystals; Optical properties; Photoluminescence; Physicochemical properties; Polymer matrix; Polyvinyl alcohols; Quenching; Semiconductor quantum dots; Surface chemistry; Chemical interactions; Optical changes; Photoluminescence quenching; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Quantum-dot composites; Surface acidity; Water-resistances; Water-soluble carbons; Crosslinking","","","This work was supported by Hanoi Pedagogical University 2 (HPU2) under Grant no.

Genomic analysis revealed that this strain comprises the complete gene set for poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis, i.e., three copies of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase and one copy of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase. An investigation on PHB accumulation in strain TH-1 demonstrated that PHB accumulation was induced by nitrogen limitation under autotrophic as well as heterotrophic conditions. This strain accumulated up to 430.4 ± 14.3 mg L−1 PHB during a 3-h incubation under nitrogen-limited heterotrophic conditions. The highest PHB accumulation rates under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions were 38.6% (w/w) of the dry cells after a 6-h induction and 53.8% after 3 h, respectively. Although PHB granules started to accumulate after 15 min of nitrogen limitation under heterotrophic conditions, a drastic decrease of PHB was observed after 9 h of induction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hydrogen Bacterium; Hydrogenophilus Thermoluteolus; Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate; Thermophile; Transmission Electron Microscopy; 3 Hydroxyacyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase; Acetyl Coenzyme A Acetyltransferase; Nitrogen; Poly(3 Hydroxybutyric Acid); Acyltransferase; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Hydrogen; Hydroxybutyric Acid; Oxidoreductase; Acetoacetyl-coa Reductase; Acyltransferases; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Hydrogen; Hydroxybutyrates; Oxidoreductases; Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoic Acid) Synthase; Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; Polyesters; Bacteria; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Hydrogen; Nitrogen; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Beta-hydroxybutyrate; Heterotrophic Conditions; Hydrogen-oxidizing Bacteria; Hydrogenophilus Thermoluteolus; Hydroxybutyrate; Moderately Thermophilic; Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthase; Thermophile; Growth Rate; 3 Hydroxyacyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase; Acetyl Coenzyme A Acetyltransferase; Nitrogen; Poly(3 Hydroxybutyric Acid); Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthase; Acetoacetyl-coa Reductase; Acyltransferase; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Hydrogen; Hydroxybutyric Acid; Oxidoreductase; Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoic Acid) Synthase; Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; Polyester; Article; Autotrophy; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Strain; Bioaccumulation; Biochemical Analysis; Controlled Study; Gene Dosage; Genome Analysis; Heterotrophy; Hydrogenophilus Thermoluteolus Th 1; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Thermophile; Thermophilic Bacterium; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Hydrogenophilaceae; Metabolism; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Temperature; Acyltransferases; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Hydroxybutyrates; Oxidation-reduction; Oxidoreductases; Polyesters; Temperature","Bacteria; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen; Nitrogen; Transmission electron microscopy; Beta-hydroxybutyrate; Heterotrophic conditions; Hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria; Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus; Hydroxybutyrate; Moderately thermophilic; Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase; Thermophile; Growth rate; 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase; nitrogen; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase; acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; acyltransferase; alcohol dehydrogenase; hydrogen; hydroxybutyric acid; oxidoreductase; poly(3-hydroxyalkanoic acid) synthase; poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; Article; autotrophy; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bioaccumulation; biochemical analysis; controlled study; gene dosage; genome analysis; heterotrophy; Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus TH 1; nonhuman; phylogeny; thermophile; thermophilic bacterium; transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogenophilaceae; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; temperature; Acyltransferases; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Hydroxybutyrates; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Polyesters; Temperature","","3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, 9028-40-4; acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase, 9027-46-7; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid), 26063-00-3; acyltransferase, 9012-30-0, 9054-54-0; alcohol dehydrogenase, 9031-72-5; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; hydroxybutyric acid, 1320-61-2, 35054-79-6; oxidoreductase, 9035-73-8, 9035-82-9, 9037-80-3, 9055-15-6; acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; Acyltransferases; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Hydrogen; Hydroxybutyrates; Oxidoreductases; poly(3-hydroxyalkanoic acid) synthase; poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; Polyesters","This work was partly supported by a research grant from The Iwatani Naoji Foundation .

Results obtained are as follows: High-speed air jetted through the starting nozzles into the yarn duct in the circumferential direction causes a swirl flow in the yarn duct and a negative pressure region near the center axis of the yarn duct. Hence, air and fibers at the fiber inlet are sucked through the processing duct into the yarn duct. A fiber bundle sucked into the yarn duct rotates, owing to the action of the swirl airflow, and twists the fiber bundle in the processing duct, hence generating a source of yarn. The fiber suction force takes a distribution with a peak against the supplied air pressure and is independent of the exhaust air pressure. The fiber twist torque increases monotonously with supplied air pressure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fiber Suction Force; Fiber Twist Torque; Swirl Airflow; Yarn Source; Atmospheric Pressure; Ducts; Fibers; Jets; Spinning Machines; Wool; Yarn; Air Jet Spinning; Airflow Characteristics; Circumferential Direction; Formation Mechanism; Negative Pressures; Suction Force; Swirl Airflow; Three-dimensional Airflow; Spinning (fibers); Barometric Pressure; Spinning Machines","Atmospheric pressure; Ducts; Fibers; Jets; Spinning machines; Wool; Yarn; Air jet spinning; Airflow characteristics; Circumferential direction; Formation mechanism; Negative pressures; Suction force; swirl airflow; Three-dimensional airflow; Spinning (fibers); Barometric Pressure; Spinning Machines","","","","Zou, Zhuanyong, Study of the stress relaxation property of vortex spun yarn in comparison with air-jet spun yarn and ring spun yarn, Fibres and Textiles in Eastern Europe, 90, 1, pp. 28-32, (2012); Basal, Guldemet, VORTEX SPUN YARN VS.

This will produce considerable amounts of fly ash from these power stations each year. To highlight the potential environmental hazards of these materials, this study is carried out to evaluate the characterization of fly ashes produced in thermal power plants in northern Vietnam. Fly ash was firstly fractionated according to size, and the fractions were characterized. Then, each of these fractions was analyzed with regard to their mineralogical features, morphological and physicochemical properties. The analytical results indicate a striking difference in terms of the characteristics of particles. It was found that magnetic fractions are composed of magnetite hematite and, to a lower rate, mullite, and quartz. Chemical analyses indicate that the non-magnetic components mainly consist of quartz and mullite as their primary mineral phases. As the main conclusion of this research, it is found that the magnetic and non-magnetic components differ in terms of shape, carbon content and mineralogical composition.

The β-glucosidase gene bglC from Thermobifida fusca YX was cloned into a cell surface display vector pGV3, resulting in pGV3-bglC. Recombinant E. coli JM109 harboring the pGV3-bglC showed β-glucosidase activity (18.9 ± 5.7 U/OD <inf>600</inf> ), indicating the cell surface functioning of mutant β-glucosidase. pH-stat cultivation using D-lactic acid producer E. coli BW25113 (ΔpflA) harboring pGV3-bglC in minimum medium with 10 g/L cellobiose in a jar fermentor under anaerobic condition resulted in 5.2 ± 0.1 g/L of D-lactic acid was obtained after 84 h cultivation, indicating that the engineered E. coli produced D-lactic acid directly from cellobiose. For continuous D-lactic acid production, cell recycle fermentation was conducted under anaerobic condition and the culture was continuously ultrafiltrated with a hollow fiber cartridge. The permeate was drawn to the reservoir and a minimum medium containing 10 g/L cellobiose was fed to the fermentor at the same rate (dilution rate, 0.05 h −1 ). Thus, this system maintained the D-lactic acid production (4.3–5.0 g/L), D-lactic acid production rate (0.22–0.25 g/L/h), and showed no residual cellobiose in the culture during 72 h operation. Interestingly, the D-lactic acid production rate in cell recycle fermentation was more than 3 times higher than that in the batch operation (0.06 ± 0.00 g/L/h). © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cell Recycle; Cellobiose; Escherichia Coli; Lactic Acid; Surface Display; Beta Glucosidase; Cellobiose; Lactic Acid; Antigens, Surface; Beta-glucosidase; Cellobiose; Lactic Acid; Recombinant Proteins; Cell Membranes; Cloning; Continuous Cell Culture; Cytology; Escherichia Coli; Fermentation; Fermenters; Genes; Recycling; Cell Recycle; Cell Recycle Fermentation; Cellobiose; D-lactic Acid Productions; Hollow Fiber Membranes; Hollow-fiber Cartridge; Recombinant Escherichia Coli; Surface Displays; Lactic Acid; Beta Glucosidase; Cellobiose; Dextro Lactic Acid; Lactic Acid; Unclassified Drug; Membrane Antigen; Recombinant Protein; Anaerobe; Article; Bacterium Culture; Bglc Gene; Cell Recycle Fermentation; Cell Surface; Controlled Study; Degradation; Fermentation Technique; Gene; Heterologous Expression; Nonhuman; Pfla Gene; Ph; Protein Expression; Synthesis; Thermobifida Fusca; Ultrafiltration; Actinomycetales; Batch Cell Culture; Biosynthesis; Enzymology; Fermentation; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Metabolic Engineering; Metabolism; Microbiological Examination; Procedures; Recycling; Transgenic Organism; Antigens, Surface; Batch Cell Culture Techniques; Beta-glucosidase; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Lactic Acid; Metabolic Engineering; Microbiological Techniques; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Recombinant Proteins","Cell membranes; Cloning; Continuous cell culture; Cytology; Escherichia coli; Fermentation; Fermenters; Genes; Recycling; Cell recycle; Cell recycle fermentation; Cellobiose; D-lactic acid productions; Hollow fiber membranes; Hollow-fiber cartridge; Recombinant Escherichia coli; Surface displays; Lactic acid; beta glucosidase; cellobiose; dextro lactic acid; lactic acid; unclassified drug; membrane antigen; recombinant protein; anaerobe; Article; bacterium culture; bglC gene; cell recycle fermentation; cell surface; controlled study; degradation; fermentation technique; gene; heterologous expression; nonhuman; pflA gene; pH; protein expression; synthesis; Thermobifida fusca; ultrafiltration; Actinomycetales; batch cell culture; biosynthesis; enzymology; fermentation; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolic engineering; metabolism; microbiological examination; procedures; recycling; transgenic organism; Antigens, Surface; Batch Cell Culture Techniques; beta-Glucosidase; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Lactic Acid; Metabolic Engineering; Microbiological Techniques; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Recombinant Proteins","","beta glucosidase, 51683-43-3, 9001-22-3; cellobiose, 16462-44-5, 528-50-7; lactic acid, 113-21-3, 50-21-5; Antigens, Surface; beta-Glucosidase; Cellobiose; Lactic Acid; Recombinant Proteins","We thank the National BioResource Project (National Institute of Genetics, Japan) for providing us with BW25113 and JW0885.

Among several external factors, environmental pH is one of the crucial parameters that greatly affects enzyme activity and cellular biochemical reactions involving tissue repair and homeostasis. In this study, in order to analyze the microenvironmental conditions during bone healing, we first measured the pH in vivo at the bone healing site using a high-resolution fiber optic pH microsensor directly in femur defects and tooth extraction sockets. The pH was shown to decrease from physiological 7.4 to 6.8 during the initial two days of healing (inflammatory phase). In the same initial stages of the inflammatory phase of the bone healing process, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to migrate to the healing site to contribute to tissue repair. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a short-term acidic (pH 6.8) pre-treatment on the stemness of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). Interestingly, the results showed that pre-treatment of BMSCs with acidic pH enhances the expression of stem cell markers (OCT-4, NANOG, SSEA-4), as well as cell viability and proliferation. On the other hand, acidic pH decreased BMSC migration ability. These results indicate that acidic pH during the initial stages of bone healing is important to enhance the stem cell properties of BMSCs. These findings may enable the development of novel methods for optimization of stem cell function towards tissue engineering or regenerative medicine. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acidic Treatment;

The results showed that Sponge-MBR exhibited effective removal of COD (94–98%) during the operation period despite increment of CIP concentrations from 20 to 200 µg L−1. The applied CIP dosage of 200 µg L−1 caused an inhibition of microorganisms in sponges, i.e. significant reduction of the attached biomass and a decrease in the size of suspended flocs. Moreover, this led to deteriorating the denitrification rate to 3–12% compared to 35% at the other lower CIP dosages. Importantly, Sponge-MBR reinforced the stability of CIP removal at various added CIP dosages (permeate of below 13 µg L−1). Additionally, the fouling rate at CIP dosage of 200 µg L−1 was 30.6 times lower compared to the control condition (no added CIP dosage). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ciprofloxacin; Dosage; Hospital Wastewater; Sponge Membrane Bioreactor; Ciprofloxacin; Nitrogen; Ciprofloxacin; Waste Water; Antibiotics; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Hospitals; Membrane Fouling; Ciprofloxacin; Denitrification Rate; Dosage; Effective Removals; Hospital Wastewater; Operation Period; Sponge-membrane Bioreactors; Treatment Performance; Wastewater Treatment; Ciprofloxacin; Nitrogen; Antibiotics; Bioreactor; Concentration (composition); Dose-response Relationship; Inhibition; Laboratory Method; Membrane; Performance Assessment; Pollutant Removal; Sponge; Suspended Load; Wastewater Treatment; Activated Sludge; Adsorption; Ammonia Oxidizing Bacterium; Article; Biodegradation; Biofouling; Biomass; Chlorination; Controlled Study; Hospital Waste; Hydraulic Retention Time; Membrane Resistance; Nonhuman; Ozonation; Particle Size; Photolysis; Physical Chemistry; Priority Journal; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Sludge; Waste Component Removal; Chemistry; Hospital; Procedures; Sewage; Waste Water; Biomass; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water","Antibiotics; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Hospitals; Membrane fouling; Ciprofloxacin; Denitrification rate; Dosage; Effective removals; Hospital wastewater; Operation period; Sponge-membrane bioreactors; Treatment performance; Wastewater treatment; ciprofloxacin; nitrogen; antibiotics; bioreactor; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; inhibition; laboratory method; membrane; performance assessment; pollutant removal; sponge; suspended load; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; adsorption; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; biodegradation; biofouling; biomass; chlorination; controlled study; hospital waste; hydraulic retention time; membrane resistance; nonhuman; ozonation; particle size; photolysis; physical chemistry; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; sludge; waste component removal; chemistry; hospital; procedures; sewage; waste water; Biomass; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Ciprofloxacin; Waste Water","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank for the research grant from National Foundation for Science and Technology Development, Vietnam (NAFOSTED) No. 105.99-2015.16, Ministry of Science and Technology, Vietnam and Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea.

The obtained materials were characterized by modern methods. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics model described the precursor mechanism of the reaction well through an intermediate compound. The low activation energy showed that the reaction was mainly controlled by diffusion. The positive activation enthalpy proved the endothermic nature of the activation process, and this process did not alter the inside structure of the catalyst. The thermodynamic parameters of the reaction were determined, which implied that the oxidation was endothermic and spontaneous at 303 K. The more negative values of the Gibbs free energy from 283 to 323 K confirmed that the reaction was more favorable at high temperatures.

Some effective conditions to the adsorption of PSS onto L-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> and S-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> such as adsorption time, pH, mass ratio of PSS to α-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> , and ionic strength were systematically studied. Maximum adsorption capacities of PSS onto both L-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> and S-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> were achieved with adsorption time 120 min, mass ratio of PSS to α-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> 20 mg/g, and ionic strength 50 mM NaCl. The PSS adsorption onto S-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> significantly decreased with increasing pH from 4 to 9 while PSS adsorption onto L-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> decreased insignificantly in the pH range 4–9. Adsorption of PSS onto both L-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> and S-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> increased with increasing salt from 0 to 50 mM NaCl, indicating that electrostatic and none-lectrostatic interactions controlled adsorption at low ionic strength. However, adsorption of PSS was independent on the ionic strength at salt concentration higher than 50 mM. The changes in surface charge after PSS adsorption onto L-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> and S-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> were determined by zeta potential while the differences of surface functional groups before and after PSS adsorption were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The zeta potential as a function of the mass ratio of PSS to L-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> and S-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> agreed well with the adsorption capacity against the mass ratio. Adsorption mechanisms of PSS onto L-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> and S-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> were also discussed based on the changes in zeta potential, the differences of surface functional groups, and adsorbed amount as a function of the mass ratio of PSS to α-Al <inf>2</inf> O <inf>3</inf> .

We describe the structural relaxation of a tagged molecule as a coupled process of cage-scale dynamics and collective molecular rearrangement beyond the first coordination shell. The coupling between local and non-local dynamics behaves distinctly in different substances. Theoretical calculations for the structural relaxation time, glass transition temperature, and dynamic fragility are carried out over twenty-two amorphous drugs and polymers. Numerical results have a quantitatively good accordance with experimental data and the extracted physical quantities using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann fit function and machine learning. The machine learning method reveals the linear relation between the glass transition temperature and the melting point, which is a key factor for pharmaceutical solubility. Our predictive approaches are reliable tools for developing drug formulations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cooling; Differential Equations; Glass; Glass Transition; Nonlinear Equations; Structural Relaxation; Temperature; Coordination Shells; Langevin Equation Theory; Machine Learning Methods; Molecular Mobility; Molecular Rearrangement; Physical Quantities; Theoretical Approach; Theoretical Calculations; Machine Learning","Cooling; Differential equations; Glass; Glass transition; Nonlinear equations; Structural relaxation; Temperature; Coordination shells; Langevin equation theory; Machine learning methods; Molecular mobility; Molecular rearrangement; Physical quantities; Theoretical approach; Theoretical calculations; Machine learning","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP19F18322 and JP18H01154.

In addition to their structure and function, modification the DNA nanostructures by other molecules opens almost unlimited possibilities for producing functional DNA-based architectures. Among the molecules to functionalize DNA nanostructures, proteins are one of the most attractive candidates due to their vast functional variations. DNA nanostructures loaded with various types of proteins hold promise for applications in the life and material sciences. When loading proteins of interest on DNA nanostructures, the nanostructures by themselves act as scaffolds to specifically control the location and number of protein molecules. The methods to arrange proteins of interest on DNA scaffolds at high yields while retaining their activity are still the most demanding task in constructing usable protein-modified DNA nanostructures. Here, we provide an overview of the existing methods applied for assembling proteins of interest on DNA scaffolds. The assembling methods were categorized into two main classes, noncovalent and covalent conjugation, with both showing pros and cons. The recent advance of DNA-binding adaptor mediated assembly of proteins on the DNA scaffolds is highlighted and discussed in connection with the future perspectives of protein assembled DNA nanoarchitectures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biotin; Nickel; Nitrilotriacetic Acid; Dna; Protein; Dna; Proteins; Adaptor Protein; Antibody; Antigen; Aptamer; Avidin; Basic Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor; Biotin; Complementary Dna; Dna Scaffold; Hexahistidine; Molecular Scaffold; Nickel; Nitrilotriacetic Acid; Unclassified Drug; Zinc Finger Protein; Dna; Nanomaterial; Protein; Article; Cell Lysate; Complex Formation; Covalent Bond; Dna Cross Linking; Dna Modification; Dna Sequence; Enzyme Mechanism; Protein Assembly; Protein Cross Linking; Protein Dna Interaction; Protein Function; Structure Analysis; Nanostructures; Proteins","adaptor protein; antibody; antigen; aptamer; avidin; basic leucine zipper transcription factor; biotin; complementary DNA; DNA scaffold; hexahistidine; molecular scaffold; nickel; nitrilotriacetic acid; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; DNA; nanomaterial; protein; Article; cell lysate; complex formation; covalent bond; DNA cross linking; DNA modification; DNA sequence; enzyme mechanism; protein assembly; protein cross linking; protein DNA interaction; protein function; structure analysis; Nanostructures; Proteins","","biotin, 58-85-5; nickel, 7440-02-0; nitrilotriacetic acid, 139-13-9, 28528-44-1; DNA, 9007-49-2; protein, 67254-75-5; DNA; Proteins","This work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, to E.

Our results confirm that the polar nature of strong bonds in these building units is a hindrance to a fully delocalized structure and disfavors the band-like mechanism of transport. We then show that a rational design of the building units can lead to dispersive band states in the electronic structure and results in conducting single-layer COFs. We demonstrate this strategy by investigating the charge carrier transport in a series of single-layer Ni-phthalocyanine (NiPc) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely, NiPc-P, NiPc-2P, and NiPc-3P. Three proposed COFs exhibit semiconducting band gaps ranging from 0.55 to 0.91 eV. Their room-temperature intrinsic mobility is predicted to be in range of 200-600 cm2 V-1 s-1 and 20000-60000 cm2 V-1 s-1 for electrons and holes, respectively, which are comparable to those of phosphorene and higher than those of the trigonal prismatic molybdenum disulfide. NiPc are dynamically and mechanically stable and can be synthesized via the co-evaporation between Ni and corresponding tetracyano linkers. Importantly, we demonstrate that the properties of the single-layer COFs can be tuned by engineering the organic building blocks. Our theoretical study not only provides insight into the design principles for semiconducting single-layer COFs but also highlights the significance of reticular chemistry in the development of a new generation of two-dimensional materials for optoelectronic applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic Structure; Energy Gap; Layered Semiconductors; Molybdenum Compounds; Sulfur Compounds; Covalent Organic Frameworks; Electron Delocalization; First-principle Study; Localized Electronic State; Molybdenum Disulfide; Optoelectronic Applications; Semiconducting Bands; Two-dimensional Materials; Carrier Transport","Electronic structure; Energy gap; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Sulfur compounds; Covalent organic frameworks; Electron delocalization; First-principle study; Localized electronic state; Molybdenum disulfide; Optoelectronic applications; Semiconducting bands; Two-dimensional materials; Carrier transport","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful for the supercomputing support from the Institute for Material Research, Tohoku University, Japan.

Few studies have evaluated the association of serum β2-M with clinical outcome in hemodialysis patients using high-flux type. However, study on patients using low-flux dialyzer reuse has not been done yet. Patients and methods: Using serum β2-M level on predicting long-term mortality of hemodialysis patients was examined in 326 prevalent hemodialysis patients (45.59±14.46 years, hemodialysis duration of 47.5 (26–79) months, 186 males and 140 females). The patients were divided into 3 groups with equal number of patients, according to their serum β2-M levels: group A (n=109, serum β2-M concentration ≤55.7 mg/L), group B (n=109, serum β2-M level from 55.8 mg/L to 75.4 mg/L) and group C (n=108, serum β2-M concentration >75.4 mg/L). Results: During the follow-up period of 5 years, there were 75 all-cause deaths (23.0%). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that all-cause mortality in the higher β2-M group was significantly higher compared to that in the lower β2-M groups (p<0.001). Serum β2-M level was a significant predictor for all-cause mortality (AUC =0.898; p<0.001; Cut-off value: 74.9 mg/L, Se=93.3%, Sp=92.9%). Conclusion: Serum β2-M levels were a significant predictor of long-term mortality in hemodialysis patients, who use only low-flux dialyzers and reuse 6 times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Beta2-microglobulin; Hemodialysis; Mortality; Beta 2 Microglobulin; C Reactive Protein; Hemoglobin; Albumin; Beta 2 Microglobulin; C Reactive Protein; Hemoglobin; Adult; All Cause Mortality; Article; Disease Marker; Female; Hemodialysis; Hemodialysis Patient; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mortality Rate; Protein Blood Level; Treatment Duration","albumin; beta 2 microglobulin; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; adult; all cause mortality; Article; disease marker; female; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; protein blood level; treatment duration","","beta 2 microglobulin, 9066-69-7; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0","","Schardijn, G.

With that goal, the SMA samples were fabricated in a local laboratory and used to generate datasets for the modeling. The considered input parameters were coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen content and cellulose. The predicted targets were Marshall Parameters such as MS, MF and MQ. Models performance assessment was evaluated thanks to criteria such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (R). A Monte Carlo approach with 1000 simulations was used to deduce the statistical results to assess the performance of the three proposed AI models. The results showed that the SVM is the best predictor regarding the converged statistical criteria and probability density functions of RMSE, MAE and R.

Accordingly, the extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) was developed to estimate HL first; then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model. The classical XGBoost model, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and classification and regression trees (CART) models were also investigated and developed to predict the HL of building systems, and compared with the proposed PSO-XGBoost model; 837 investigations of buildings were considered and analyzed with many influential factors, such as glazing area distribution (GAD), glazing area (GA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), and relative compactness (RC). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), mean absolute error (MAE), and determination coefficient (R2), were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the above models. The color intensity, as well as the ranking method, were also used to compare and evaluate the models. The results showed that the proposed PSO-XGBoost model was the most robust technique for estimating the HL of building systems. The remaining models (i.e., XGBoost, SVM, RF, GP, and CART) yielded more mediocre performance through RMSE, MAE, R2, VAF, and MAPE metrics. Another finding of this study also indicated that OH, RA,WA, and SA were the most critical parameters for the accuracy of the proposed PSO-XGBoost model.

The regulation of local ROS level and redox equilibrium plays a critical role in preventing and curing biological disorders. Various endogenous redox enzymes are balanced to maintain physiological hemostasis in vivo, but this balance is lost when ROS is excessively produced, leading to strong oxidative stress and diseases. Not only natural vitamins C and E but also many antioxidants are synthesized to eliminate excessively produced ROS. However, most antioxidants have been largely ineffective in clinical settings, due to their low stability and nonspecific and short activity in physiological conditions. One of the other important problems of these low-molecular-weight antioxidants is that they cause the dysfunction of normal cells by destroying normal redox reactions such as an electron transport chain after their nonspecific cellular internalization. In order to suppress these types of adverse side effects, we have been developing polymer antioxidants, which prevent their internalization in healthy cells to protect important normal redox reactions. Antioxidant polymers composed of an amphiphilic block copolymer self-assemble in water to become redox nanoparticles (RNPs). To date, we have proven that RNPs exert a high therapeutic efficacy on diseases strongly dependent on various oxidative stresses, including ulcerative colitis, Alzheimer;s disease, ischemia reperfusion injuries such as brain, heart, kidney, and intestinal ischemia reperfusion, and cancer. More recently, we started to develop new antioxidant nanomedicines for local diseases related to oxidative stress. For these objectives, we designed novel redox polyion complex micelles (PIC) that form irreversible temperature-responsive hydrogels at body temperature for local therapies. Since PIC-based hydrogel possesses a nitroxide radical as a catalytic ROS scavenger covalently conjugated in the polymer backbone, it exhibits therapeutic function by regulating the local redox equilibrium. After conversion to a hydrogel, it continuously eliminates ROS locally and suppresses rapid diffusion at injected sites. In this chapter, we describe the design, preparation, and characterization of developed redox injectable hydrogel and its medical applications for arthritis, periodontal disease, local anesthesia, as well as its application as an anti-adhesive gel and its sustained release of bioactive molecules in other medical therapies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adhesives; Antioxidants; Biosynthesis; Block Copolymers; Conjugated Polymers; Disease Control; Electron Transport Properties; Functional Polymers; Hydrogels; Medical Applications; Micelles; Molecular Biology; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Physiology; Amphiphilic Block Copolymers; Cellular Internalization; Electron Transport Chain; Ischemia-reperfusion Injury; Low Molecular Weight Antioxidants; Physiological Condition; Polyion Complex Micelles; Temperature-responsive Hydrogels; Redox Reactions","Adhesives; Antioxidants; Biosynthesis; Block copolymers; Conjugated polymers; Disease control; Electron transport properties; Functional polymers; Hydrogels; Medical applications; Micelles; Molecular biology; Neurodegenerative diseases; Oxidative stress; Oxygen; Physiology; Amphiphilic block copolymers; Cellular internalization; Electron transport chain; Ischemia-reperfusion injury; Low molecular weight antioxidants; Physiological condition; Polyion complex micelles; Temperature-responsive hydrogels; Redox reactions","","","A part of this work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research A (21240050) and Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up (22800004) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.

The disadvantages of the currently state are the using treatment systems with low treatment efficiency, costly and unstable due to using microbiological, biochemistries, combining physical chemistry method. In this study, the treatment alcohol from laboratory using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) at low temperature and at atmospheric pressure was designed and developed to solve the above disadvantages. An 800ml/h treatment system was completed and assembled. In order to prove the stability of the processing system, before and after treating, alcohol samples were collected and measured with methanol, aldehyde, furfural, acidity by the Quality Assurance and Testing Center. The treating duration and applied voltage were studied. The results show that with high discharge density, the toxics in alcohol rapidly increased due to oxidation reaction. However, at high applied voltage and long treating duration the treatment efficiency increased.

In this work, a total of 40 CaNF-Y-encoding genes, including eight CaNF-YAs, 21 CaNF-YBs, and 11 CaNF-YCs, were identified in chickpea, and their major gene and protein characteristics were subsequently obtained using various web-based tools. Of our interest, a phylogenetically-based analysis predicted 18 CaNF-Ys (eight CaNF-YAs, seven CaNF-YBs, and three CaNF-YCs) that potentially play roles in chickpea responses to dehydration according to their close relationship with the well-characterized GmNF-Ys in soybean. These results were in good agreement with the enrichment of drought-responsive cis-regulatory motifs and expression patterns obtained from in silico analyses using publically available transcriptome data. Most of the phylogenetically predicted drought-responsive CaNF-Y genes (15 of 18) were quantitatively validated to significantly respond to dehydration treatment in leaves and/or roots, further supporting the results of in silico analyses. Among these CaNF-Y genes, the transcript levels of CaNF-YA01 and CaNF-YC10 were the most highly accumulated in leaves (by approximately eight-fold) and roots (by approximately 18-fold), respectively, by dehydration. Furthermore, 12 of the 18 CaNF-Y genes were found to be responsive to the most well-known stress hormone, namely abscisic acid (ABA), in leaves and/or roots, suggesting that these genes may act in chickpea response to dehydration in ABA-dependent manner. Taken together, our study has provided a comprehensive and fundamental information for further functional analyses of selected CaNF-Y candidate genes, ultimately leading to the improvement of chickpea growth under water-limited conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abscisic Acid; Cicer Arietinum; Dehydration; Expression Analysis; Nuclear Factor-y; Phylogenetic Analyses; Quantitative Pcr; Transcription Factor; Abscisic Acid; Amino Acid; Cytosine; Thymine; Abscisic Acid; Ccaat-binding Factor; Nuclear Factor Y; Plant Proteins; Abscisic Acid; Amino Acid; Canf Ya; Canf Yb; Canf Yc; Cbf Transcription Factor; Coupling Element 3; Cytosine; Dehydration Responsive Element; Initiation Factor 4a; Myb Binding Site; Myc Binding Site; Nuclear Factor Y; Nuclear Factor Ya; Nuclear Factor Yb; Nuclear Factor Yc; Phytohormone; Thymine; Unclassified Drug; Ccaat Binding Factor; Plant Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Chickpea; Chromosomal Localization; Conserved Sequence; Dehydration; Dna Responsive Element; Drought Stress; Environmental Stress; Exon; Gene Duplication; Gene Expression; Genetic Transcription; Heat Stress; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Isoelectric Point; Molecular Weight; Natural Selection; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Plant Development; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Plant Root; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Dna Interaction; Protein Stability; Regulatory Sequence; Rna Extraction; Shoot; Signal Transduction; Cicer; Classification; Drought; Drug Effect; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Metabolism; Abscisic Acid; Ccaat-binding Factor; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Polymerase Chain Reaction","abscisic acid; amino acid; CaNF YA; CaNF YB; CaNF YC; CBF transcription factor; coupling element 3; cytosine; dehydration responsive element; initiation factor 4A; MYB binding site; MYC binding site; nuclear factor Y; nuclear factor YA; nuclear factor YB; nuclear factor YC; phytohormone; thymine; unclassified drug; CCAAT binding factor; plant protein; amino acid sequence; Article; chickpea; chromosomal localization; conserved sequence; dehydration; DNA responsive element; drought stress; environmental stress; exon; gene duplication; gene expression; genetic transcription; heat stress; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; isoelectric point; molecular weight; natural selection; nonhuman; phylogeny; plant development; plant growth; plant leaf; plant root; polymerase chain reaction; protein DNA interaction; protein stability; regulatory sequence; RNA extraction; shoot; signal transduction; Cicer; classification; drought; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Abscisic Acid; CCAAT-Binding Factor; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Polymerase Chain Reaction","","abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; amino acid, 65072-01-7; cytosine, 71-30-7; thymine, 65-71-4; Abscisic Acid; CCAAT-Binding Factor; nuclear factor Y; Plant Proteins","This research was partly funded by the International Program Associate of RIKEN (Japan), and the National Foundation for Science & Technology Development of Vietnam (Grant No. 106-NN.02-2013.46).","Ohri, Deepak, The origin of chickpea (Cicer arietinum l): Karyotype and nuclear dna amount, Heredity, 66, 3, pp. 362-372, (1991); Rachwał-Rosiak, Danuta, Chickpeas—Composition, Nutritional Value, Health Benefits, Application to Bread and Snacks: A Review, Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 55, 8, pp. 1137-1145, (2015); Acharjee, Sumita, Biotechnologically generating 'super chickpea' for food and nutritional security, Plant Science, 207, pp. 108-116, (2013); Bird, Libby G., Products of chickpea processing as texture improvers in gluten-free bread, Food Science and Technology International, 23, 8, pp. 690-698, (2017); El-Beltagi, Hossam Saad, The impact of using chickpea flour and dried carp fish powder on pizza quality, PLOS ONE, 12, 9, (2017); Nasr-Esfahani, Maryam, Approaches for enhancement of N2 fixation efficiency of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) under limiting nitrogen conditions, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 12, 3, pp. 387-397, (2014); Int J Agil Agron Plant Prod, (2013); van Ha, Chien, Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the CaNAC family members in chickpea during development, dehydration and ABA treatments, PLOS ONE, 9, 12, (2014); Garg, Rohini, Transcriptome analyses reveal genotype- and developmental stage-specific molecular responses to drought and salinity stresses in chickpea, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Mahdavi Mashaki, Keyvan, RNA-Seq analysis revealed genes associated with drought stress response in kabuli chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), PLOS ONE, 13, 6, (2018)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","14220067; 16616596","","","30360493","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055617440"

The degradation of the LDPE films (thickness of ~25 μm) containing different catalyst concentrations were successfully investigated by different techniques, such as Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and mechanical tests. The results showed that the use of catalyst in which TiO<inf>2</inf>-BP content (1/3 w/w) is 0.5 phr (parts per hundred resin) and EVA content is 4.5 phr in a LDPE film provided the best degradation rate. The carbonyl index of the polymer film achieved the highest value without an equilibrium stage. Besides, the carbon-carbon backbone of the polymer was completely broken down consistent with the deformation of the surface. In addition, the mechanical properties impressively dropped after 3 months' exposure. The obtained results imply that the TiO<inf>2</inf>-BP-EVA compound can be considered as an efficient catalyst for the photodegradation of LDPE polymer. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzophenone; Catalyst; Photodegradation; Polyethylene Film; Titanium Dioxide; Carbon; Catalysts; Differential Scanning Calorimetry; Ethylene; Field Emission Microscopes; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Photodegradation; Polyethylenes; Polymer Films; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Semiconducting Films; Thermogravimetric Analysis; Ambient Conditions; Benzophenone; Ethylene Vinyl Acetates; Low Density Polyethylene Films; Novel Catalysts; Photo Degradation; Photo-oxidization; Photochemical Degradation; Polyethylene Film; ]+ Catalyst; Titanium Dioxide","Carbon; Catalysts; Differential scanning calorimetry; Ethylene; Field emission microscopes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Photodegradation; Polyethylenes; Polymer films; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconducting films; Thermogravimetric analysis; Ambient conditions; Benzophenone; Ethylene vinyl acetates; Low density polyethylene films; Novel catalysts; Photo degradation; Photo-oxidization; Photochemical degradation; Polyethylene film; ]+ catalyst; Titanium dioxide","","","Acknowledgment: The authors would like to acknowledge support from the Basic Science Research Program (2017R1D1A1B03028413) and (2016R1A6A1A03012069) through the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education of Korea.

Various solid commercial rubbers such as standard Vietnam rubber (SVR10), standard Indonesia rubber (SIR10), India standard natural rubber (ISNR10), ribbed smoked sheets (RSS3), and FNR (commercial Sumitomo Rubber) were used as a source. Purification of the samples was carried out through acetone extraction and purified samples were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy. Degradation was found for SVR10, ISNR10, and SIR10 but not for RSS3 and FNR through the assignment of 13C-NMR signals. Acetone extraction was found to improve the green strength of commercial NR due to the removal of impurities. Linked fatty acids and proteins contributed to the upturn of stress at small strain. However, the network structure of degraded rubbers had an insignificant role in enhancing the green strength of commercial NR. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commercial Natural Rubber; Fatty Acids; Green Strength; Network Structure; Protein; Acetone; Extraction; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Proteins; Purification; Removal; Rubber; Smoke; Acetone Extraction; Commercial Natural Rubber; Green Strength; Indonesia; Network Structures; Resonance Signals; Ribbed Smoked Sheets; Solid Rubber; Sumitomo; Viet Nam; Fatty Acids","Acetone; Extraction; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Proteins; Purification; Removal; Rubber; Smoke; Acetone extraction; Commercial natural rubber; Green strength; Indonesia; Network structures; Resonance signals; Ribbed smoked sheets; Solid rubber; Sumitomo; Viet Nam; Fatty acids","","","Acknowledgments: This research was funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant nos. 104.02-2017.35 and 104.02-2016.47.","Biotechnology Molecular Studies and Novel Applications for Improved Quality of Human Life, (2012); Thuong, Nghiem Thi, Analysis of damage in commercial natural rubber through NMR spectroscopy, Polymer Degradation and Stability, 123, pp. 155-161, (2016); Processing of Natural Rubber, (2003); Smr Bull, (1973); Eng, A.

Since there is no electrode or sampling chip installed inside the air-flow channel, impediments to airborne particle flow or ion winds are removed along the flow direction. In addition, the isolation of ion winds, which generate circuit, allows using various materials for the sampling chip including non-conductors and also protecting collected particles from any discharge ignition on the chip. The device mechanism is numerically simulated in OpenFOAM to study the electrofluidodynamic interaction of charged particles and bipolar ion winds.

Unlike the conventional configuration where one electrode generates charged ions moving towards the reference electrode, this configuration allows both negative and positive charges to simultaneously move away from the device and generate ion wind in parallel with the electrodes. In comparison with the direct current (DC) driven corona generator, the time oscillating AC field allows the device a better stabilization owing to the independence of ion wind strength from the inter-electrode spacing. Our results by both simulation and experiment showed that when the AC frequency exceeds a threshold value of 1100 Hz, the electric field at the electrode tips is determined dominantly by the charge cloud created in the previous half-cycle, resulting in stronger net electric field and thus stronger ion wind. In addition, the electrode separation in the AC driven corona based generator is less critical above the frequency threshold, yielding a more robust design with minimized susceptibility to manufacturing tolerances and impurities on the electrodes. Moreover, lower voltage levels of the AC driven system allow simpler and more economical design in the high voltage circuit of the AC generator. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternating Current; Bipolar Discharge; Ion Wind; Parallel Pin; Electric Impedance Measurement; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; Hvdc Power Transmission; Ions; Alternating Current; Bipolar Discharge; Electrode Separation; High Voltage Circuits; Inter-electrode Spacing; Ion Wind; Manufacturing Tolerances; Parallel Pin; Electric Discharges","Electric impedance measurement; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; HVDC power transmission; Ions; Alternating current; Bipolar discharge; Electrode separation; High voltage circuits; Inter-electrode spacing; Ion wind; Manufacturing tolerances; Parallel pin; Electric discharges","","","Tung Thanh Bui would like to thank Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) for financial support under grant 107.99-2016.36 .","Moreau, Éric, Airflow control by non-thermal plasma actuators, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 40, 3, pp. 605-636, (2007); Corke, Thomas C., Dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators for flow control, Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 42, pp. 505-529, (2010); undefined, (2012); Alamgholilou, A., Experimental investigation on hydrodynamics and heat transfer of fluid flow into channel for cooling of rectangular ribs by passive and EHD active enhancement methods, Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, 38, pp. 61-73, (2012); Go, David B., Direct simulation of ionization and ion transport for planar microscale ion generation devices, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 42, 5, (2009); Kibler, Kenneth G., Electrocooling in gases, Journal of Applied Physics, 45, 10, pp. 4436-4440, (1974); Rashkovan, Alexander, Experimental optimization of an electric blower by corona wind, Applied Thermal Engineering, 22, 14, pp. 1587-1599, (2002); Martins, Alexandre A., Modelling of an improved positive corona thruster and actuator, Journal of Electrostatics, 71, 1, pp. 61-67, (2013); Zhao, Lin, Numerical analysis of forces in an electrostatic levitation unit, Journal of Electrostatics, 63, 6-10, pp. 729-734, (2005); Martins, Alexandre A., On the influence that the ground electrode diameter has in the propulsion efficiency of an asymmetric capacitor in nitrogen gas, Physics of Plasmas, 18, 3, (2011)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","08941777","","ETFSE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046667257"

In this study, we investigated the effect of strain-induced crystallization on the tear energy (G) of NR/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blends with different compositions and cross-link densities. Using a shift factor, we could superimpose G of an SBR blend and an NR/SBR (1/9) blend onto a single master curve. In contrast, G of NR was split into two master curves. Although the master curve of G for the NR/SBR (3:7) blend was split, increasing the cross-link density threefold made it possible to superimpose it onto a single master curve. Strain-induced crystallization of NR in the NR/SBR blend did not occur as a result of decreasing the NR content, increasing the cross-link density, or removing fatty acids.

As a consequence, the possibility that micelles can adsorb at the air/water surface has been disregarded and has led to some abnormalities in the literature that remain as yet unresolved. In this paper, we closely examined the two critical concentrations for a double-chain cationic surfactant. We confirmed that the two concentrations represent two different physical phenomena. Furthermore, the results verified the existence of surface micelles, which are different from the bulk micelles. The formation of the surface micelles can be explained by the structural changes of the adsorption layer, which was also corroborated by molecular simulations. The findings open new challenges to examine the surface adsorption, which offers new insights into the molecular levels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Rosen, Milton J., Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena: Fourth Edition, (2012); Long, Joshua A., Micelle Structure and Hydrophobic Hydration, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 137, 33, pp. 10809-10815, (2015); McBain, James William, CCXV. - Studies of the constitution of soap in solution: Sodium myristate and sodium laurate, Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions, 101, pp. 2042-2056, (1912); Aqueous Solutions of Paraffin Chain Salts, (1936); Carpena, Pedro, Problems associated with the treatment of conductivity-concentration data in surfactant solutions: Simulations and experiments, Langmuir, 18, 16, pp. 6054-6058, (2002); Powney, J., The properties of detergent solutions, Transactions of the Faraday Society, 33, pp. 1243-1260, (1937); Menger, Frederic M., Relationship between surface tension and surface coverage, Langmuir, 27, 23, pp. 13975-13977, (2011); Lottermoser, Alfred, Untersuchungen über die Oberflächen- und Grenzflächenaktivität von Salzen der Fettalkoholschwefelsäureester, Kolloid Zeitschrift, 63, 1, pp. 49-61, (1933); Israelachvili, Jacob N., Self-Assembly in Two Dimensions: Surface Micelles and Domain Formation in Monolayers, Langmuir, 10, 10, pp. 3774-3781, (1994); Li, Peixun, Limitations in the use of surface tension and the gibbs equation to determine surface excesses of cationic surfactants, Langmuir, 30, 23, pp. 6739-6747, (2014)","","American Chemical Society service@acs.org","","","","","","24701343","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053193591"

Moreover, water productivity or water use efficiency in rice production was quite low in the region due to free-rider problem. Therefore, the study was aimed at measuring water use efficiency at farm level and investigating the factors affecting water use efficiency. The study applied stochastic frontier analysis to estimate water use efficiency for 159 rice farmers in the upstream of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The study shows that the average water use efficiency was 18.81%, indicating that rice farmers did consume water very inefficiently. On the average, the rice farmers could reduce their water consumption about 81.19%, keeping their output level and other inputs constant. To improve water use efficiency, the study found that land accumulation or large-scaled production is essential. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Tobit Regression; Water Use Efficiency; Agriculture; Efficiency; Stochastic Systems; Water Supply; Climate Change Adaptation; Dam Construction; Mekong Delta; Rice Farmers; Rice Production; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Tobit Regression; Vietnamese; Water Scarcity; Water Use Efficiency; Climate Change","Agriculture; Efficiency; Stochastic systems; Water supply; Climate change adaptation; Dam construction; Mekong Delta; Rice farmers; Rice production; Stochastic frontier analysis; Tobit regression; Vietnamese; Water scarcity; Water use efficiency; Climate change","","","This research (ID number R11616) was funded by RONPAKU, JSPS.

Since CuO plays a critical role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the formed composite, its structural properties are particularly studied using synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). XANES confirms the presence of Cu species with +2 oxidation state in the form of CuO. EXAFS furthermore confirms that each Cu cation is coordinated to four O anions in an approximately square planar configuration. The length of the Cu-O coordination is estimated to be 1.92 Å, slightly shorter than that of bulk CuO (1.95 Å).

Among the various chemical forms of mercury, methylmercury is known to be particularly neurotoxic, and was identified as the cause of Minamata disease. It bioaccumulates in fish and shellfish via aquatic food webs, and fish and sea mammals at high trophic levels exhibit high mercury concentrations. Most human methylmercury exposure occurs through seafood consumption. Methylmercury easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and so can affect the nervous system. Fetuses are known to be at particularly high risk of methylmercury exposure.

These biomass conversion inhibitors, particularly vanillin, are known to repress translation activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have reported that the mRNAs of ADH7 and BDH2 were efficiently translated under severe vanillin stress despite marked repression of overall protein synthesis. In this study, we found that expression of VFH1 (YLL056C) was also significantly induced at the protein level by severe vanillin stress. Additionally, we demonstrated that the VFH1 promoter enabled the protein synthesis of other genes including GFP and ALD6 under severe vanillin stress. It is known that transcriptional activation of VFH1 is induced by furfural and HMF, and we verified that Vfh1 protein synthesis was also induced by furfural and HMF. The null mutant of VFH1 delayed growth in the presence of vanillin, furfural and HMF, indicating the importance of Vfh1 for sufficient tolerance against these inhibitors. The protein levels of Vfh1 induced by the inhibitors tested were markedly higher than those of Adh7 and Bdh2, suggesting the superior utility of the VFH1 promoter over the ADH7 or BDH2 promoter for breeding optimized yeast strains for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","5-hydroxymethylfurfural;

The LMTree is a relatively new machine learning algorithm that was rarely explored for landslide study, whereas BE is an ensemble framework that has proven highly efficient for landslide modeling. Upper Reaches Area of Red River Basin (URRB) in Northwest region of Viet Nam was employed as a case study. For this work, a GIS database for the URRB area has been established, which contains a total of 255 landslide polygons and eight predisposing factors i.e., slope, aspect, elevation, land cover, soil type, lithology, distance to fault, and distance to river. The database was then used to construct and validate the proposed BE-LMTree model. Quality of the final BE-LMTree model was checked using confusion matrix and a set of statistical measures. The result showed that the performance of the proposed BE-LMTree model is high with the classification accuracy is 93.81% on the training dataset and the prediction capability is 83.4% on the on the validation dataset. When compared to the support vector machine model and the LMTree model, the proposed BE-LMTree model performs better; therefore, we concluded that the BE-LMTree could prove to be a new efficient tool that should be used for landslide modeling. This research could provide useful results for landslide modeling in landslide prone areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bagging Ensemble; Gis; Landslide; Logistic Model Trees; Vietnam","","","","We would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments on the earlier version of the manuscript This work is supported by: (i) the Scientific Research Project 02/2012/HD-HTQTSP funded by Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam; and (ii) by the Scientific Research Project DTNCCB-DHUD.2012-G/01 funded by NAFOSTED, Ministry of Science and Technology, Vietnam.

This study presents a dielectrophoresis (DEP) microfluidic enrichment platform combined with a built-in capacitive sensor for circulating tumor cell detection. The microchip is composed of a lollipop-shaped gold microelectrode structure under a polydimethylsiloxane chamber. A prototype of the device was fabricated using standard micromachining technology. With the proposed device, target cells (in this study, A549 non-small human lung carcinoma and S-180 sarcoma cell lines) are firstly guided toward the center of the working chamber via DEP forces. Then, the target cells are captured by an electrode immobilized by anti-EGFR, which has high affinity toward the target cells. After the cell concentration process, the differential capacitance is read to detect the presence of the target cells. Numerical simulations and measurement experiments were performed to demonstrate the high sensitivity of differential capacitive sensing. The obtained results show high sensitivity for S-180 cell detection (3 mV/cell). The proposed platform is suitable for rapid cancer diagnoses and other metabolic disease applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capacitive Sensor; Circulating Tumor Cell Detection; Dielectrophoresis (dep) Enrichment; Differential Measurement; Rare Cells; Cell Culture; Diagnosis; Electrophoresis; Microelectrodes; Microfluidics; Molecular Biology; Silicones; Tumors; Capacitive Sensing; Circulating Tumor Cells; Differential Capacitance; Differential Measurements; Gold Microelectrodes; Metabolic Disease; Micromachining Technologies; Simulations And Measurements; Capacitive Sensors; Aptamer; Article; Biocompatibility; Cancer Diagnosis; Circulating Tumor Cell; Controlled Study; Electric Conductivity; Electric Field; Electrochemical Analysis; Electrophoresis; Electrostimulation; Finite Element Analysis; Human; Human Cell; Impedance; Impedance Spectroscopy; Lung Cancer; Mass Spectrometry; Mathematical Model; Microchip Analysis; Microchip Electrophoresis; Microfluidic Analysis; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Signal Processing; Simulation; Tumor Cell; Wireless Communication","Cell culture; Diagnosis; Electrophoresis; Microelectrodes; Microfluidics; Molecular biology; Silicones; Tumors; Capacitive sensing; Circulating tumor cells; Differential capacitance; Differential measurements; Gold microelectrodes; Metabolic disease; Micromachining technologies; Simulations and measurements; Capacitive sensors; aptamer; Article; biocompatibility; cancer diagnosis; circulating tumor cell; controlled study; electric conductivity; electric field; electrochemical analysis; electrophoresis; electrostimulation; finite element analysis; human; human cell; impedance; impedance spectroscopy; lung cancer; mass spectrometry; mathematical model; microchip analysis; microchip electrophoresis; microfluidic analysis; scanning electron microscopy; signal processing; simulation; tumor cell; wireless communication","","","Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the Vietnamese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for financial support through a project entitled “Development on the aptamer-based and electrical impedance sensing microfluidic system for circulating tumor cells detection”, project code NDT.15.TW/16 as well as the Ministry of Science and Technology of Republic of China (Taiwan) under grants MOST105-2923-E-194-002-MY3 and MOST105-2221-E-194-024-MY2.

In inflamed tissues, overproduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) rapidly react with the endogenous NO, reducing its bioavailability. Here, we developed a controllable NO-releasing redox injectable hydrogel (NO-RIG) formed by the electrostatic crosslinking between the polyion complex flower-type micelles composing of functional polymers to scavenge overproduced ROS and regulate the local NO expression level simultaneously. After the intracardiac injection to mice, NO-RIG converted to gel via physiological temperature-responsive character, distributed homogeneously, and retained in the myocardial tissue for more than 10 d. Treatment with NO-RIG remarkably decreased the infarction size and improved the heart function after myocardial infarction when compared to control injectable hydrogels, such as a simple NO-releasing or ROS-scavenging injectable gels. We found that NO-RIG treatment significantly enhanced the angiogenesis and new blood vessels formation in mice through the regulation of the NO sustained release and redox equilibrium. NO-RIG presents high potential in preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Myocardial Infarction; Nitric Oxide Delivery; Polyion Complex Micelle; Reactive Oxygen Species; Redox Injectable Hydrogel; Nitric Oxide; Polyacrylic Acid; Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Delayed-action Preparations; Hydrogels; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; Reactive Oxygen Species; Biochemistry; Blood Vessels; Cardiology; Crosslinking; Diseases; Mammals; Micelles; Nitric Oxide; Tissue; Cardio-vascular Disease; Injectable Hydrogels; Intracardiac Injection; Myocardial Infarction; Physiological Temperature; Polyion Complex Micelles; Reactive Oxygen Species; Therapeutic Application; Hydrogels; Nitric Oxide; Poly(ethylene Glycol) Block Poly(levo Arginine); Polyacrylic Acid; Polymer; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Unclassified Drug; Angiogenic Factor; Nitric Oxide Donor; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Antiangiogenic Activity; Article; Controlled Study; Cross Linking; Drug Bioavailability; Drug Retention; Gelation; Heart Infarction; Heart Infarction Size; Hydrogel; Male; Micelle; Mouse; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Raw 264.7 Cell Line; Single Drug Dose; Sustained Drug Release; Temperature Sensitivity; Animal; Chemistry; Delayed Release Formulation; Injection; Institute For Cancer Research Mouse; Metabolism; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Pathology; Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Animals; Delayed-action Preparations; Injections; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred Icr; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; Oxidation-reduction; Raw 264.7 Cells; Reactive Oxygen Species","Biochemistry; Blood vessels; Cardiology; Crosslinking; Diseases; Mammals; Micelles; Nitric oxide; Tissue; Cardio-vascular disease; Injectable hydrogels; Intracardiac injection; Myocardial Infarction; Physiological temperature; Polyion complex micelles; Reactive oxygen species; Therapeutic Application; Hydrogels; nitric oxide; poly(ethylene glycol) block poly(levo arginine); polyacrylic acid; polymer; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; angiogenic factor; nitric oxide donor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiangiogenic activity; Article; controlled study; cross linking; drug bioavailability; drug retention; gelation; heart infarction; heart infarction size; hydrogel; male; micelle; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; RAW 264.7 cell line; single drug dose; sustained drug release; temperature sensitivity; animal; chemistry; delayed release formulation; injection; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Animals; Delayed-Action Preparations; Injections; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; Oxidation-Reduction; RAW 264.7 Cells; Reactive Oxygen Species","","nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; polyacrylic acid, 74350-43-9, 87003-46-1, 9003-01-4, 9003-04-7; Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Delayed-Action Preparations; Hydrogels; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; Reactive Oxygen Species","This work was partly supported by Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research ( 16K15628 ), and Young Scientist B ( 16K16397 ) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.","Persidis, Aris, Cardiovascular disease drug discovery, Nature Biotechnology, 17, 9, pp. 930-931, (1999); Weber, Christian M., Atherosclerosis: Current pathogenesis and therapeutic options, Nature Medicine, 17, 11, pp. 1410-1422, (2011); Simons, Michael P., Therapeutic angiogenesis in cardiovascular disease, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2, 11, pp. 863-871, (2003); Massion, Paul Bernard, Nitric oxide and cardiac function: Ten years after, and continuing, Circulation Research, 93, 5, pp. 388-398, (2003); Lundberg, Jon O., The nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway in physiology and therapeutics, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 7, 2, pp. 156-167, (2008); Bogdan, Christian, Nitric oxide and the immune response, Nature Immunology, 2, 10, pp. 907-916, (2001); Bredt, David S., Localization of nitric oxide synthase indicating a neural role for nitric oxide, Nature, 347, 6295, pp. 768-770, (1990); Moncada, Sir Salvador, Nitric oxide: Physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology, Pharmacological Reviews, 43, 2, pp. 109-142, (1991); Gobert, Alain P., L-arginine availability modulates local nitric oxide production and parasite killing in experimental trypanosomiasis, Infection and Immunity, 68, 8, pp. 4653-4657, (2000); Rajapakse, Niwanthi W., Role of l-arginine in nitric oxide production in health and hypertension, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology, 36, 3, pp. 249-255, (2009)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01429612; 18785905","9781119043553; 9781848215856","BIMAD","29571050","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046033016"

In situ Raman and electroanalysis studies suggest the origin of the high selectivity toward C<inf>2</inf> products to be a combined effect of the enhanced stabilization of the Cu<inf>2</inf>O overlayer and the optimal availability of the CO intermediate due to the Ag incorporated in the alloy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alcohol; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Copper Oxide; Ethylene; Guanazole; Binary Alloys; Carbon Dioxide; Copper Alloys; Copper Oxides; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Electrolytic Reduction; Ethylene; Mesoporous Materials; Metallic Films; Applied Potentials; Cathode Potential; Electro Reduction; Electroreduction Of Co2; Faradaic Efficiencies; High Selectivity; High Surface Area; Nano-porous Coppers; Silver Alloys; Alcohol; Alloy; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Copper Oxide; Copper Silver Alloy; Ethylene; Guanazole; Hydrocarbon; Unclassified Drug; Article; Catalyst; Chemical Reaction; Controlled Study; Electric Current; Electric Potential; Electrodeposition; Electroreduction; Porosity; Surface Area","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Copper alloys; Copper oxides; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Mesoporous materials; Metallic films; Applied potentials; Cathode potential; Electro reduction; Electroreduction of CO2; Faradaic efficiencies; High selectivity; High surface area; Nano-porous coppers; Silver alloys; alcohol; alloy; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; copper oxide; copper silver alloy; ethylene; guanazole; hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; Article; catalyst; chemical reaction; controlled study; electric current; electric potential; electrodeposition; electroreduction; porosity; surface area","","alcohol, 64-17-5; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; copper oxide, 1344-70-3; ethylene, 74-85-1; guanazole, 1455-77-2","","Carbon Sequestration for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, (2017); Hansen, James E., Assessing ""dangerous climate change"": Required reduction of carbon emissions to protect young people, future generations and nature, PLOS ONE, 8, 12, (2013); Whipple, Devin T., Prospects of CO2 utilization via direct heterogeneous electrochemical reduction, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 1, 24, pp. 3451-3458, (2010); Yang, Hongqun, Progress in carbon dioxide separation and capture: A review, Journal of Environmental Sciences (China), 20, 1, pp. 14-27, (2008); Appel, Aaron M., Frontiers, opportunities, and challenges in biochemical and chemical catalysis of CO2 fixation, Chemical Reviews, 113, 8, pp. 6621-6658, (2013); Oláh, George Andrew, Anthropogenic chemical carbon cycle for a sustainable future, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 133, 33, pp. 12881-12898, (2011); Costentin, Cyrille, Catalysis of the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, Chemical Society Reviews, 42, 6, pp. 2423-2436, (2013); Lim, Rernjern, A review on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in fuel cells, metal electrodes and molecular catalysts, Catalysis Today, 233, pp. 169-180, (2014); Kortlever, Ruud, Catalysts and Reaction Pathways for the Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 6, 20, pp. 4073-4082, (2015); Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry, (2008)","","American Chemical Society service@acs.org","","","","","","15205126; 00027863","","JACSA","29620896","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046366426"

The homogeneous system (FAMEs/triglyceride/methanol) was attained when the FAME content was more than 30 wt %.

The quality of BDF with high FAME content satisfied the criteria of the EN 14214/JIS K2390 standards.

A needle-type hydrophone scanned the sonochemical reactor in horizontal and vertical directions at one-millimeter interval. To show an absolute value of broadband noise, average of broadband sound pressure was defined. The distribution of sound pressures at the fundamental and second harmonic frequencies were also measured. In the case of driving frequency at 130 kHz, sonochemical reaction fields were observed in several ellipse shapes. The reaction fields in upper part of the reactor was high because cavitation bubbles moved upper part due to radiation force. The sound pressure distribution at the fundamental frequency showed existence of standing wave and reaction fields were weak at pressure antinode because cavitation bubbles were repelled by primary Bjerknes force. The sound pressure distribution at the second harmonic frequency indicated that the pattern of bubbles distribution resembled to that of reaction fields closely. In the case at 43 kHz, distributions of reaction fields and sound pressures were complex due to coupled vibration. The reaction fields were relatively weak in areas which had very high sound pressures at the fundamental frequency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Broadband Noise; Reaction Field; Second Harmonic Frequency; Sonochemical Reactor; Sound Pressure; Cavitation; Freons; Harmonic Analysis; Natural Frequencies; Pressure Distribution; Sonochemistry; Broadband Noise; Reaction Fields; Second Harmonics; Sonochemical Reactors; Sound Pressures; Acoustic Noise; Cooling Water; Article; Force; Noise Measurement; Pressure Measurement; Priority Journal; Sound Pressure; Ultrasound; Vibration","Cavitation; Freons; Harmonic analysis; Natural frequencies; Pressure distribution; Sonochemistry; Broadband noise; Reaction fields; Second harmonics; Sonochemical reactors; Sound pressures; Acoustic noise; cooling water; Article; force; noise measurement; pressure measurement; priority journal; sound pressure; ultrasound; vibration","","","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) Number 16H04560 from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science .","Suslick, Kenneth S., Sonochemical synthesis of amorphous iron, Nature, 353, 6343, pp. 414-416, (1991); Hyeon, Taeghwan, Nanostructured molybdenum carbide: Sonochemical synthesis and catalytic properties, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 118, 23, pp. 5492-5493, (1996); Okitsu, Kenji, Sonochemical preparation and catalytic behavior of highly dispersed palladium nanoparticles on alumina, Chemistry of Materials, 12, 10, pp. 3006-3011, (2000); Kotronarou, Anastasia, Decomposition of Parathion in Aqueous Solution by Ultrasonic Irradiation, Environmental Science and Technology, 26, 7, pp. 1460-1462, (1992); Kawase, Yasuhito, Development of small ultrasonic reactor for on-site treatment of wastewater including chlorinated hydrocarbon, Journal of Chemical Engineering of Japan, 39, 1, pp. 95-98, (2006); Chiha, Mahdi, Modeling of ultrasonic degradation of non-volatile organic compounds by Langmuir-type kinetics, Ultrasonics Sonochemistry, 17, 5, pp. 773-782, (2010); Dähnke, Sascha W., Modeling of three-dimensional pressure fields in sonochemical reactors with an inhomogeneous density distribution of cavitation bubbles.

In Southeast Asia, many non-edible oils are used to produce BDFs, as exemplified by the recent use of the non-edible oil derived from Vernicia montana Lour. in Laos and Vietnam for the production of BDF. In this work, we developed an improved procedure for the production of BDF from Vernicia montana oil consisting of 80.3%±0.5% α-eleostearic acid moiety (C18:3) using a co-solvent method. Furthermore, the stability of the BDF was evaluated based on its iodine value and unsaturated ester content. The optimized production conditions were determined to be as follows: methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, 1% (wt/wt) KOH, 20% (wt/wt) acetone as a co-solvent, and a reaction temperature of 40°C. Under these conditions, we achieved a BDF conversion efficiency of 99%±0.3% within 30 min of initiating the transesterification process. Notably, the BDF produced from Vernicia montana oil showed good stability to air at temperatures ≤30°C for 1 month, showing similar stability properties to the BDF produced from rapeseed oil. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiesel Production; Co-solvent Method; Iodine Value; Low Energy Consumption; Vernicia Montana Lour.

Vietnam is a multiethnic country with the highest incidence of gastric cancer in Southeast Asia, but previous studies focused only on the Kinh ethnic group. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using 494 volunteers (18–78 years old), from 13 ethnic groups in Daklak and Lao Cai provinces, Vietnam. H. pylori status was determined by multiple tests (rapid urease test, culture, histology, and serology). cagA and vacA genotypes were determined by PCR-based sequencing. The overall H. pylori infection rate was 38.1%. Multivariate analysis showed that variations in geographical region, age, and ethnicity were independent factors associated with the risk of H. pylori acquisition. Therefore, multicenter, multiethnic, population based study is essential to assess the H. pylori prevalence and its burden in the general population. Only the E De ethnicity carried strains with Western-type CagA (82%) and exhibited significantly lower gastric mucosal inflammation compared to other ethnic groups. However, the histological scores ofWestern-type CagA and East-Asian-type CagA within the E De group showed no significant differences. Thus, in addition to bacterial virulence factors, host factors are likely to be important determinants for gastric mucosal inflammation and contribute to the Asian enigma. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian Enigma; Helicobacter Pylori; Molecular Epidemiology; Virulence Factor; Virulence Factors; Virulence Factor; Adult; Aged; Article; Blood Sampling; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Cytotoxin Associated Gene A; Dna Extraction; Duodenum Ulcer; Ethnicity; Female; Gastric Mucosal Inflammation; Gastritis; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Gastroscopy; Gene; Gene Sequence; Genotype; Geographic Distribution; Helicobacter Infection; Helicobacter Pylori; Human; Human Tissue; Immunohistochemistry; Interview; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nonhuman; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Population Research; Prevalence; Scoring System; Stomach Biopsy; Stomach Cancer; Stomach Disease; Stomach Ulcer; Vacuolating Cytoxotin A; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Classification; Ethnic Group; Ethnology; Gastrointestinal Disease; Genetics; Health Survey; Microbiology; Middle Aged; Molecular Epidemiology; Pathogenicity; Pathology; Virulence; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Ethnic Groups; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Epidemiology; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Vietnam; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Young Adult","virulence factor; adult; aged; Article; blood sampling; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cytotoxin associated gene a; DNA extraction; duodenum ulcer; ethnicity; female; gastric mucosal inflammation; gastritis; gastroesophageal reflux; gastroscopy; gene; gene sequence; genotype; geographic distribution; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; interview; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; population research; prevalence; scoring system; stomach biopsy; stomach cancer; stomach disease; stomach ulcer; vacuolating cytoxotin a; Viet Nam; adolescent; classification; ethnic group; ethnology; gastrointestinal disease; genetics; health survey; microbiology; middle aged; molecular epidemiology; pathogenicity; pathology; virulence; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Ethnic Groups; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Epidemiology; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Vietnam; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Young Adult","","Virulence Factors","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (DK62813) and the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan 26640114, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) 15H02657, and Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) 16H05191) (to Y.Y.).

The results showed that Ag NPs with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly distributed on TNTs surface. Ag NPs improved both photocatalytic and the antibacterial activity of TNTs under sunlight irradiation. Ag/TNTs decomposed 81.2% of methylene blue and 75.8% of methylene orange after 150 min under sunlight irradiation. In addition, Ag/TNTs at 20 ppm concentration eliminated 99.99% of Staphylococcus aureus after 60 min under sunlight irradiation.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are heat-stable and resistant to hydrolysis by digestive enzymes, representing a potential hazard for consumers worldwide. In the present study, we used amino-acid sequences encoding SEA and SEB-like to identify their respective template structure and build the three-dimensional (3-D) models using homology modeling method. Two natural compounds, Betulin and 28-Norolean-12-en-3-one, were selected for docking study on the basis of the criteria that they satisfied the Lipinski’s Rule-of-Five. A total of 14 and 13 amino-acid residues were present in the best binding site predicted in the SEA and SEB-like, respectively, using the Computer Atlas of Surface Topology of Proteins (CASTp). Among these residues, the docking study with natural compounds Betulin and 28-Norolean-12-en-3-one revealed that GLN43 and GLY227 in the binding site of the SEA, each formed a hydrogen-bond interaction with 28-Norolean-12-en-3-one; while GLY227 residue established a hydrogen bond with Betulin. In the case of SEB-like, the docking study demonstrated that ASN87 and TYR88 residues in its binding site formed hydrogen bonds with Betulin; whereas HIS59 in the binding site formed a hydrogen-bond interaction with 28-Norolean-12-en-3-one. Our results demonstrate that the toxic effects of these two SEs can be effectively treated with antitoxins like Betulin and 28-Norolean-12-en-3-one, which could provide an effective drug therapy for this pathogen. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","28-norolean-12-en-3-one; 3-d Structure; Amino-acid Residues; Betulin; Docking; Enterotoxin; Food Poisoning; In Silico; Staphylococcus Aureus; Betulin; Staphylococcus Enterotoxin A; Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B; Antitoxins; Enterotoxins; Ligands; Antiinflammatory Agent; Antitoxin; Betulin; Staphylococcus Enterotoxin; Staphylococcus Enterotoxin A; Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B; Enterotoxin; Ligand; Amino Acid Sequence; Anthelmintic Activity; Antimalarial Activity; Antineoplastic Activity; Article; Food Poisoning; Nonhuman; Protein Expression; Staphylococcus Aureus; Staphylococcus Infection; Biology; Chemistry; Molecular Docking; Molecular Model; Procedures; Reproducibility; Structural Homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Antitoxins; Computational Biology; Enterotoxins; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Molecular Docking Simulation; Reproducibility Of Results; Structural Homology, Protein","antiinflammatory agent; antitoxin; betulin; Staphylococcus enterotoxin; Staphylococcus enterotoxin A; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B; enterotoxin; ligand; amino acid sequence; anthelmintic activity; antimalarial activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; food poisoning; nonhuman; protein expression; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; biology; chemistry; molecular docking; molecular model; procedures; reproducibility; structural homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Antitoxins; Computational Biology; Enterotoxins; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Molecular Docking Simulation; Reproducibility of Results; Structural Homology, Protein","","betulin, 473-98-3; Staphylococcus enterotoxin A, 37337-57-8; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, 39424-53-8; Antitoxins; Enterotoxins; Ligands","","International Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances, (2014); Adv Appl Sci Res, (2011); E Gnosis, (2008); Hennekinne, Jacques Antoine, Staphylococcus aureus and its food poisoning toxins: Characterization and outbreak investigation, FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 36, 4, pp. 815-836, (2012); Thänert, Robert, Host-inherent variability influences the transcriptional response of Staphylococcus aureus during in vivo infection, Nature Communications, 8, (2017); Int J Biot Appl, (2010); Dunyach-Rémy, Catherine, Staphylococcus aureus toxins and diabetic foot ulcers: Role in pathogenesis and interest in diagnosis, Toxins, 8, 7, pp. 1-20, (2016); Foster, Tim J., Immune evasion by staphylococci, Nature Reviews Microbiology, 3, 12, pp. 948-958, (2005); Essmann, Frank, Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin-induced cell death: Predominant necrosis despite apoptotic caspase activation, Cell Death and Differentiation, 10, 11, pp. 1260-1272, (2003); Johler, Sophia, Outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning among children and staff at a Swiss boarding school due to soft cheese made from raw milk, Journal of Dairy Science, 98, 5, pp. 2944-2948, (2015)","","MDPI AG Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","14220067; 16616596","","","29301344","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041627064"

In this work, a bipolar ion wind generator configured by parallel arranged electrodes is used for centrifugal mixing applications. With the proposed configuration, negative and positive ion winds are simultaneously generated, mixed and then neutralized by each other while travelling toward liquid surface.

We have already established the Fiber-Cement-Stabilized Soil Method that can improve the weak soil of actual landslide areas engendered from an earthquake or heavy rainfall by using paper fragments and cement. However, nowadays, the cost of fiber (paper debris) is tending to increase and Portland cement is not environmentally friendly cementitious material for sustainable development. In this research, Geopolymer which expects to modify soft soil (sludge) at low degree Celsius condition and reduces amount additive of fiber is executed. The process of Geopolymerization involving the silicates and aluminates exacted from by-products is contemplated as a mature and cost-effective solution to many problems where hazardous residue has to be treated and stored under critical environmental conditions. This paper presents the details of the study carried out on the characteristic of sludge improved Fiber-Geopolymer-Stabilized Soil Method. The composition of imitation sludge was 60% silt, 40% clay and 70% water content. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 12 Molar and sodium silicate solution (Na<inf>2</inf>SiO<inf>3</inf>) were prepared.

The wood-based biomass produced biochars with lower ash contents (<14 wt.%db ash) and higher fixed carbon contents (> 54 wt.%db), greater higher heating value (>23 MJ/kg), higher degree of aromaticity (with O/C, H/C, and volatile matter/fixed carbon ratios were less than 0.08, 0.51, and 0.61, respectively), and smaller amount of salt nutrients (<76 g/kgdb) compared with those of the herbaceous-based biochars. Their unique properties have generated more interest in using them as a solid fuel, for carbon sequestration, and for soil amendment. The rice husk biochars contained more than 300 g/kgdb silica, which is potential for silicophilic plants. The water hyacinth biochars with the greatest volatile matter/fixed carbon (ranging from 0.72 to 2.35), and highest O/C ratios (0.11 to 0.18), indicating the lowest aromaticity among studied biochars and thus maybe least suitability for carbon sequestration. They also possessed a highest soluble salts content (>240 g/kgdb), highest electrical conductivity (>6489 μS/cm), and greatest liming potential (>6.56 %CaCO<inf>3</inf>-eq), which may not be suitable for salt-sensitive plants or low-buffer capacity soils. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bamboo; Biochar; Melaleuca; Physicochemical Properties; Rice Husk; Water Hyacinth; Bamboo; Biomass; Calcite; Calcium Carbonate; Calorific Value; Carbon; Fuels; Silica; Soils; Bio Chars; Carbon Sequestration; Electrical Conductivity; Higher Heating Value; Melaleuca; Physical And Chemical Properties; Rice Husk; Water Hyacinth; Physicochemical Properties; Calcium Carbonate","Bamboo; Biomass; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Calorific value; Carbon; Fuels; Silica; Soils; Bio chars; Carbon sequestration; Electrical conductivity; Higher heating value; Melaleuca; Physical and chemical properties; Rice husk; Water Hyacinth; Physicochemical properties; Calcium Carbonate","","","The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Taro Ueda and Dr. Hiroshi Asakura at Nagasaki University for their technical and equipment support in the EDX measurements and proximate analysis.

Simulation has been conducted by using GROMACS. Various force fields are examined to compare the calculated density to choose the AMBERGS with parameter adjustment. The results predict the density within 5% or relative error to the experimental value, and the value of D (relative diffusion coefficient of oxygen to the humidified electrolyte membrane) within about 20% of relative error to the experiment in the range of λ (water content) between 2.5 to 7.5. The results also predict the decreasing trend of D with increasing T (temperature of the membrane) within the range of 80 ˚C to 30 ˚C. Comparison between calculated and experimentally obtained values of Ea (activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plot of D) with various λ are also disccussed to show that the calculated values are relatively smaller than the values in membrane and closer to the value in bulk water. The results can be due to the domain size.

This disease is primarily caused by the two closely related serotypes of Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). Here, we analyse Japanese virologic and syndromic surveillance time-series data from 1982 to 2015. As in some other countries in the Asia Pacific region, EV-A71 in Japan has a 3 year cyclical component, whereas CV-A16 is predominantly annual. We observe empirical signatures of an inhibitory interaction between the serotypes; virologic lines of evidence suggest they may indeed interact immunologically. We fit the time series to mechanistic epidemiological models: as a first-order effect, we find the data consistent with single-serotype susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics. We then extend the modelling to incorporate an inhibitory interaction between serotypes. Our results suggest the existence of a transient cross-protection and possible asymmetry in its strength such that CV-A16 serves as a stronger forcing on EV-A71. Allowing for asymmetry yields accurate out-of-sample predictions and the directionality of this effect is consistent with the virologic literature. Confirmation of these hypothesized interactions would have important implications for understanding enterovirus epidemiology and informing vaccine development. Our results highlight the general implication that even subtle interactions could have qualitative impacts on epidemic dynamics and predictability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Epidemiological Modelling; Hand-foot-mouth Disease; Multi-strain Dynamics; Non-polio Enteroviruses; Antigens, Viral; Epidemiology; Time Series; Asia Pacific Region; Epidemiological Modelling; Epidemiological Models; Foot And Mouth Disease; Multi Strains; Non-polio Enteroviruses; Syndromic Surveillance; Vaccine Development; Dynamics; Article; Coxsackievirus A16; Cross Protection; Epidemic; Hand Foot And Mouth Disease; Human; Japan; Nonhuman; Periodicity; Sentinel Surveillance; Serotype; Time Series Analysis; Virus Transmission; Wavelet Analysis; Computer Simulation; Enterovirus; Time Factor; Virology; Virus Antigen; Antigens, Viral; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Hand, Foot And Mouth Disease; Humans; Serogroup; Time Factors","Epidemiology; Time series; Asia Pacific region; Epidemiological modelling; Epidemiological models; Foot and mouth disease; Multi strains; Non-polio enteroviruses; Syndromic surveillance; Vaccine development; Dynamics; Article; Coxsackievirus A16; cross protection; epidemic; hand foot and mouth disease; human; Japan; nonhuman; periodicity; sentinel surveillance; serotype; time series analysis; virus transmission; wavelet analysis; computer simulation; Enterovirus; time factor; virology; virus antigen; Antigens, Viral; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Serogroup; Time Factors","","Antigens, Viral","This work is supported by the Center for Health & Wellbeing, Princeton University (S.T.), the University of Tokyo-Princeton Strategic Partnership (S.T., C.J.E.M., B.T.G.), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (C.J.E.M., B.T.G.), the Wellcome Trust (H.R.v.D., T.L.V., J.J.F.) and the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics program of the Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security and the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health (C.J.E.M., B.T.G.).","Shimizu, Hiroyuki, Enterovirus 71 from fatal and nonfatal cases of hand, foot and mouth disease epidemics in Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan in 1997-1998, Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases, 52, 1, pp. 12-15, (1999); Xing, Weijia, Hand, foot, and mouth disease in China, 2008-12: An epidemiological study, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 14, 4, pp. 308-318, (2014); Wang, Yu, Hand, foot, and mouth disease in China: Patterns of spread and transmissibility, Epidemiology, 22, 6, pp. 781-792, (2011); A Guide to Clinical Management and Public Health Response for Hand Foot and Mouth Disease Hfmd, (2011); Wpro Hand Foot and Mouth Disease Hfmd, (2018); Tagaya, Isamu, Epidemic of hand, foot and mouth disease in japan, Japanese Journal of Medical Science and Biology, 26, 3, pp. 143-147, (1973); Akiyoshi, Kyoko, Enteroviruses in patients experiencing multiple episodes of hand, foot, and mouth disease in the same season in Kobe, Japan, 2011, Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases, 65, 5, pp. 459-461, (2012); Ooi, Monghow, Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of enterovirus 71, The Lancet Neurology, 9, 11, pp. 1097-1105, (2010); Li, Rongcheng, An inactivated enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy children, New England Journal of Medicine, 370, 9, pp. 829-837, (2014); Zhu, Fengcai, Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of an enterovirus 71 vaccine in China, New England Journal of Medicine, 370, 9, pp. 818-828, (2014)","","Royal Society Publishing sales@royalsoc.ac.uk","","","","","","17425689; 17425662","","","30209044","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053374513"

Normally, in the commercially available expression system, cells were grown rapidly in protein expression. However, over cell growth was not only unnecessary for high level protein expression, but also induced cell death and led to protein degradation. Aims and Objectives: To overcome these limitations a new adapted culture method needs to be developed. Methods: In this work, we developed growth control medium for transient high protein expression system using NPLAd (Non-Protein and Lipid Medium Adopted) cells. With this system, cell numbers were not increased until 10 days. Results: Our results indicated that expression level in NPLAd system was 1.8 times higher than that in Free style system, which was one of the commercially available high expression systems. Conclusion: The antibody performance expressed by NPLAd system was almost the same to that of expressed by Free style system.

Improving the evaluation of vulnerable rupture is important to prevent acute heart failure. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) method is one of techniques to acquire information about atherosclerotic plaque, which is backscattered ultrasound signal sensed by IVUS transducer. The vessel structure and tissue components are then characterized in relation to the acquired signals. In this study, eight human coronary vessel sections are involved, and we use discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to classify coronary tissues as a target classifier. The quantization domain of IVUS signals are used to extract binary features for adapting Gaussian model of RBM. In addition, we propose a misclassification sensitive training of disRBM to deal with the class imbalances.

In this paper, a two-step co-solvent method for BDF production from CNO was examined. Firstly, esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) (7 wt%) present in CNO was carried out using a co-solvent of acetonitrile (30 wt%) and H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> as a catalyst. The content of FFAs was reduced to 0.8 wt% in 1 h at 65℃. Subsequent transesterification of the crude oil produced was carried out using a co-solvent of acetone (20 wt%) and 1 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH). Ester content of 99.3% was obtained at 40℃ in 45 min. The water content in BDF was 0.023% upon purification using vacuum distillation at 5 kPa. The components of CNO BDF were characterized using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector. The physicochemical properties of BDF satisfied the ASTM D6751-02 standard. The gaseous exhaust emissions from the diesel engine upon combustion of the BDF blends (B0–B100) with petrodiesel were examined. The emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were clearly lower, but that of nitrogen oxides was higher in comparison to those from petro-diesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiesel; Candlenut Oil; Co-solvent Technology; Exhaust Gases; Transesterification; Acetone; Carbon Monoxide; Hydroxide; Nitrogen Oxide; Potassium Hydroxide; Sulfuric Acid; Water; Acetone; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydroxides; Nitrogen Oxides; Plant Oils; Potassium Compounds; Potassium Hydroxide; Solvents; Sulfuric Acid; Sulfuric Acids; Water; Acetone; Biodiesel; Carbon Monoxide; Crude Oil; Diesel Engines; Diesel Fuels; Distillation; Esters; Exhaust Gases; Fatty Acids; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Gas Chromatography; Ionization Of Gases; Nitrogen Oxides; Potassium Hydroxide; Transesterification; Candlenut Oil; Cosolvents; Esterification Of Free Fatty Acids; Exhaust Emission; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry; Gas Chromatography-flame Ionization Detectors; Physicochemical Property; Vacuum Distillation; Organic Solvents; Acetone; Biofuel; Carbon Monoxide; Fatty Acid; Hydrocarbon; Hydroxide; Nitrogen Oxide; Potassium Derivative; Potassium Hydroxide; Solvent; Sulfuric Acid; Vegetable Oil; Water; Aleurites; Catalysis; Chemical Phenomena; Chemistry; Esterification; Flame Ionization Detection; Gas; Infrared Spectroscopy; Temperature; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Catalysis; Chemical Phenomena; Esterification; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Flame Ionization; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydroxides; Nitrogen Oxides; Plant Oils; Potassium Compounds; Solvents; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Sulfuric Acids; Temperature; Water","Acetone; Biodiesel; Carbon monoxide; Crude oil; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Distillation; Esters; Exhaust gases; Fatty acids; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Ionization of gases; Nitrogen oxides; Potassium hydroxide; Transesterification; Candlenut oil; Cosolvents; Esterification of free fatty acids; Exhaust emission; Fourier transform infrared spectrometry; Gas chromatography-flame ionization detectors; Physicochemical property; Vacuum distillation; Organic solvents; acetone; biofuel; carbon monoxide; fatty acid; hydrocarbon; hydroxide; nitrogen oxide; potassium derivative; potassium hydroxide; solvent; sulfuric acid; vegetable oil; water; Aleurites; catalysis; chemical phenomena; chemistry; esterification; flame ionization detection; gas; infrared spectroscopy; temperature; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Catalysis; Chemical Phenomena; Esterification; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Flame Ionization; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydroxides; Nitrogen Oxides; Plant Oils; Potassium Compounds; Solvents; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Sulfuric Acids; Temperature; Water","","acetone, 67-64-1; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; hydroxide, 14280-30-9; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; potassium hydroxide, 1310-58-3; sulfuric acid, 7664-93-9; water, 7732-18-5; Acetone; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydroxides; Nitrogen Oxides; Plant Oils; Potassium Compounds; potassium hydroxide; Solvents; sulfuric acid; Sulfuric Acids; Water","This study was supported by Vietnam Counterpart finance of the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Project(SATREPS Project): “Multi-beneficial Measures for Mitigation of Climate Change in Vietnam and Indochina Countries by Development of Biomass Energy, JST-JICA”.","Ramanathan, Veerabhadran, Trace-gas greenhouse effect and global warming: Underlying Principles and Outstanding Issues Volvo Environmental Prize Lecture-1997, Ambio, 27, 3, pp. 187-197, (1998); J Kones Powertrain Transp; Wong, Yee Ching, Biodiesel production from used cooking oil, Oriental Journal of Chemistry, 30, 2, pp. 521-528, (2014); Ramadhas, Arumugam Sakunthalai, Biodiesel production from high FFA rubber seed oil, Fuel, 84, 4, pp. 335-340, (2005); Proc World Congr Eng Comput Sci; Maeda, Yasuaki, New technology for the production of biodiesel fuel, Green Chemistry, 13, 5, pp. 1124-1128, (2011); Luu, Phuongduc Duc, Co-solvent method produce biodiesel form waste cooking oil with small pilot plant, Energy Procedia, 61, pp. 2822-2832, (2014); Ejikeme, Paul Madus, Catalysis in biodiesel production by transesterification processes-an insight, E-Journal of Chemistry, 7, 4, pp. 1120-1132, (2010); Thanh, Letu, Catalytic technologies for biodiesel fuel production and utilization of glycerol: A review, Catalysts, 2, 1, pp. 191-222, (2012); World Acad Sci Eng Technol, (2008)","","Japan Oil Chemists Society yukagaku@jocs-office.or.jp","","","","","","13473352; 13458957","","","29628489","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046412993"

In many operating regimes, a proper design of high-speed underwater bodies, e.g., the slender ones, should produce not only a stable motion with a straight trajectory but also maximize the travel distance of the bodies. To this end, both physical experiment and CFD simulation can be exploited to investigate the behaviors of a body. Regarding this issue, a number of previous studies have been carried out. However, little specific data of the body design have been documented in the published literature so far. This study investigates numerically a number of varied designs of high-speed underwater slender bodies. The designs are different in some of the bodies’ typical parameters which include the cavitator shape and body length. Steady state simulations of the single/two-phase partial- and super-cavitating flows around the bodies have been carried out by using the CFD approach. A two-phase mixture formulation, turbulence k-ɛ model (for the solution of the flow field) and Zwart-Geber-Belamri (ZGB) cavitation modeling (for mass transfer modeling) are exploited. For the model validation, comparisons with the published experimental and numerical data have been performed. The behaviors of the natural cavitating flow around the different bodies investigated are obtained. The modified drag coefficient for these specific bodies and operating conditions are proposed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cavitation; Computational Fluid Dynamics—cfd; High-speed; Two-phase Flow; Underwater; Cavitation; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Drag; Mass Transfer; Speed; Cavitating Flow; Cfd Simulations; Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfds); High Speed; Higher Speed Applications; Moving Objects; Reduction Effects; Submerged Bodies; Two Phases Flow; Underwater; Two Phase Flow","Cavitation; Computational fluid dynamics; Drag; Mass transfer; Speed; Cavitating flow; CFD simulations; Computational fluid dynamics (CFDs); High Speed; Higher speed applications; Moving objects; Reduction effects; Submerged bodies; Two phases flow; Underwater; Two phase flow","","","Acknowledgements Financial support from the following scientific research projects of Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) and Institute of Mechanics (IMECH) to carry out this study is gratefully acknowledged: -VAST01.04/17-18 and VAST.HTQT.NGA.01/17-18 project of VAST -Annual Research Fund of 2017 of IMECH (to Eng.

The Isogeometric approach is a computational geometry based on a piecewise ratio function (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)) used to represent the exact geometry. In the Isogeometric approach, the free curvature geometry of the beam element can be represented exactly. A thick two-node curved beam element can be developed by using the Isogeometric approach based on Timoshenko beam theory, which allows the transverse shear deformation and rotatory inertia effects. The natural shape of the beam curvature and the shape functions formulation of the element can be formulated by using the Isogeometric approach. However, in the Isogeometric approach, the number of equations will increase according to the number of degree of the polynomial and its control points. A novel technique is been proposed to condense the number of equations of the DOFs at control points so that it is equal to the standard two-node six DOFs beam element. This paper highlights the application of the NURBS for a curved Timoshenko beam element in the context of finite element analysis and proposes a new condensation method to eliminate the drawbacks raised from the Isogeometric approach. Examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the condensation method in static and free vibration problems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Condensation; Finite Element Analysis; Isogeometric Approach; Thick Curved Beam; Computation Theory; Computational Geometry; Condensation; Interpolation; Particle Beams; Rational Functions; Shear Flow; Beam Elements; Control Point; Curved Beam Elements; Curved Beams; Finite Element Analyse; Isogeometric Approach; Non-uniform Rational B-splines; Structural Deformation; Thick Curved Beams; Transverse Displacements; Finite Element Method","Computation theory; Computational geometry; Condensation; Interpolation; Particle beams; Rational functions; Shear flow; Beam elements; Control point; Curved beam elements; Curved beams; Finite element analyse; Isogeometric approach; Non-uniform rational B-splines; Structural deformation; Thick curved beams; Transverse displacements; Finite element method","","","","Yamada, Yoshiaki, On curved finite elements for the analysis of circular arches, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 11, 11, pp. 1635-1651, (1977); Ashwell, D.

However it is one of the most complicated two-phase phenomena due to, for example, the simultaneous liquid/vapor motion at the same time with heat and mass transfer across the phase interfaces, distorted and deformable phase interface geometry with complicated bubble breakup/coalescence mechanisms etc. As the accuracy of the CFD simulation of two-phase flows has much improved, numerical study of subcooled pool boiling two-phase flow by using the CFD approach is desirable. To incorporate experimental and numerical studies of subcooled boiling, the objective of this study is to setup a numerical modeling of the subcooled pool boiling in a vertical pipe by using the CFD approach. The numerical setup is based on the physical experimental model developed in our previous study. For the numerical simulation of subcooled pool boiling and wall boiling, the extended RPI boiling model is exploited in the framework of the two-fluid CFD approach. Test simulations by using the numerical setup have been carried out for three cases: a single air bubble rising in still water, a vapor Taylor bubble rising in saturated still water, and a vapor bubble rising and condensing in subcooled still water. Evaluation of the model setup has been clarified. An initial simulation of subcooled pool boiling has also been demonstrated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bubbly Flow; Cfd Simulation; Heat Mass Transfer; Subcooled Boiling; Two-fluid Approach; Two-phase Flow; Wall Boiling; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Heat Transfer; Mass Transfer; Numerical Models; Phase Interfaces; Bubbly Flow; Cfd Simulations; Heat-mass Transfer; Pool Boiling; Sub-cooled Boiling; Subcooled; Two Phases Flow; Two-fluid; Two-fluid Approach; Wall Boiling; Two Phase Flow","Computational fluid dynamics; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Numerical models; Phase interfaces; Bubbly flow; CFD simulations; Heat-mass transfer; Pool boiling; Sub-cooled boiling; Subcooled; Two phases flow; Two-fluid; Two-fluid approach; Wall boiling; Two phase flow","","","Acknowledgements Financial support from the following scientific research project of Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) to carry out this study is gratefully acknowledged: VAST01.04/17-18 project.","Thermo Fluid Dynamics of Two Phase Flow, (2010); Two Phase Flow Boiling and Condensation in Conventional and Miniature Systems, (2008); Yeoh, Guan Heng, Computational Techniques for Multiphase Flows: Basics and Applications, pp. 1-643, (2009); Modelling Subcooled Boiling Flows, (2009); Krepper, Eckhard, CFD modelling of subcooled boiling-Concept, validation and application to fuel assembly design, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 237, 7, pp. 716-731, (2007); Warrier, Gopinath R., Interfacial heat transfer during subcooled flow boiling, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 45, 19, pp. 3947-3959, (2002); Nguyen, Tat Thang, Measurement of the condensation rate of vapor bubbles rising upward in subcooled water by using two ultrasonic frequencies, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 99, pp. 159-169, (2016); Dykas, Sławomir, Single- and two-fluid models for steam condensing flow modeling, International Journal of Multiphase Flow, 37, 9, pp. 1245-1253, (2011); International Conference Nuclear Energy for New Europe, (2005); Kharangate, Chirag R., Review of computational studies on boiling and condensation, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 108, pp. 1164-1196, (2017)","","Pleiades journals","","","","","","21954364; 21954356","9789819650583; 9783031991585; 9783031948886; 9789819667314; 9789811937156; 9783030703318; 9789811622779; 9789811969447; 9789819701056; 9789819748051","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042855103"

It is considered that fracture toughness of materials can be estimated by means of the SPT based on the measurement of equivalent fracture strain in the SPT and its correlation with fracture toughness. Moreover, fracture toughness of TRIP (transformation-induced plasticity) steel was evaluated by J-integral by using pre-cracked specimen under three-point bending test in the past study. However, the value of J-integral is determined at a limited range of deformation rate in three-point bending test. Thus, fracture toughness of TRIP steel needs to be evaluated by means of the SPT, especially at a relatively high deformation rate. Additionally, since the effect of strain-induced martensitic transformation during plastic deformation of TRIP steel coupled with a high increase of temperature is quite complicated, a computational work is indispensable. In this study, finite element simulations are performed for the SPT at various deflection rates and different sizes of specimen and puncher by an application of damage model for type-304 austenitic stainless steel, a kind of TRIP steel. The rate-sensitivity of fracture-mechanical characteristics is examined for different sizes of specimen and puncher. Furthermore, a relationship between equivalent fracture strain in the SPT and J-integral obtained from three-point bending test is challenged to be correlated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Finite Element Simulation; J-integral; Small Punch Test; Trip Steel; Austenitic Stainless Steel; Finite Element Method; High Strength Steel; Martensitic Transformations; Plasticity; Deformation Rates; Different Sizes; Ductile Materials; Equivalent Fracture Strain; Finite Elements Simulation; J Integral; Measurements Of; Small Punch Test; Three-point Bending Test; Transformation Induced Plasticity Steel; Fracture Toughness","Austenitic stainless steel; Finite element method; High strength steel; Martensitic transformations; Plasticity; Deformation rates; Different sizes; Ductile materials; Equivalent fracture strain; Finite elements simulation; J integral; Measurements of; Small punch test; Three-point bending test; Transformation induced plasticity steel; Fracture toughness","","","Acknowledgements This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant no. 107.02-2017.17.

We also examined model analyses, which are based on the Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek theory with the effect of charge heterogeneity, to discuss the aggregation of lysozyme-coated silica. Our results show that lysozymes enhance the aggregation of silica when the lysozyme-coated silica is near the isoelectric point. When the adsorbed amount of lysozyme is low, the effect of charge-patch attractive force promotes the aggregation of silica. The effect of charge heterogeneity weakens with the increase of adsorbed amount of lysozyme. Our model which takes account of the effect of charge heterogeneity can capture the trend of the aggregation of silica in the presence of lysozyme qualitatively, but there are also large quantitative discrepancies between the theoretical prediction and experimental results.

The synthesis of mesoporous Pt/CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures involves two steps. First, mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures were synthesized via macroalgae polymer mediated approach and followed by supporting of PtNPs of ca. 5-10 nm over the mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures using seed-mediated chemical reduction process. The structural and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies confirm the strong coupling between PtNPs and the mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> support resulting in the generation of more oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the enhanced charge transport at their functional interface. Significantly, the synthesized mesoporous Pt/CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures were found to show enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ethanol electrooxidation reaction. The enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of both mesoporous structure and the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the resultant Pt/CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures. Our facile and eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures that supports PtNPs with an excellent catalytic activity is validated as a promising strategy for potential applications in fuel cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cerium Oxide; Electrocatalysis; Ethanol Electrooxidation; Platinum Nanoparticles; Red Algae; Algae; Catalyst Activity; Catalytic Oxidation; Cerium; Cerium Oxide; Chemical Bonds; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrooxidation; Ethanol; Fuel Cells; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Ionic Liquids; Mesoporous Materials; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Oxides; Oxygen Vacancies; Platinum; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; X Ray Scattering; Catalytic Performance; Electrocatalytic Activity; Ethanol Electro-oxidation; Ethanol Electrooxidation Reactions; Mesoporous Structures; Platinum Nano-particles; Red Algae; Spectroscopic Characterization; Cerium Compounds","Algae; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Cerium; Cerium oxide; Chemical bonds; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrooxidation; Ethanol; Fuel cells; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ionic liquids; Mesoporous materials; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Oxides; Oxygen vacancies; Platinum; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray scattering; Catalytic performance; Electrocatalytic activity; Ethanol electro-oxidation; Ethanol electrooxidation reactions; Mesoporous structures; Platinum nano-particles; Red algae; Spectroscopic characterization; Cerium compounds","","","","Chueh, William C., High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes, Nature Materials, 11, 2, pp. 155-161, (2012); Shao, Minhua, Recent Advances in Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction, Chemical Reviews, 116, 6, pp. 3594-3657, (2016); Shang, Zeyu, Core-shell"" nanostructured supported size-selective catalysts with high catalytic activity, Nano Letters, 17, 1, pp. 104-109, (2017); Malgras, Victor, Nanoarchitectures for Mesoporous Metals, Advanced Materials, 28, 6, pp. 993-1010, (2016); Stephens, Ifan E.L., Understanding the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction on platinum and its alloys, Energy and Environmental Science, 5, 5, pp. 6744-6762, (2012); Mistry, Hemma, Nanostructured electrocatalysts with tunable activity and selectivity, Nature Reviews Materials, 1, (2016); Banham, Dustin William H., Current status and future development of catalyst materials and catalyst layers for proton exchange membrane fuel cells: An industrial perspective, ACS Energy Letters, 2, 3, pp. 629-638, (2017); Ferreira, Paulo J., Instability of Pt/C electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells: A mechanistic investigation, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 152, 11, pp. A2256-A2271, (2005); Greeley, Jeffrey P., Alloys of platinum and early transition metals as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts, Nature Chemistry, 1, 7, pp. 552-556, (2009); Xia, Younan, Toward cost-effective and sustainable use of precious metals in heterogeneous catalysts, Accounts of Chemical Research, 50, 3, pp. 450-454, (2017)","","American Chemical Society service@acs.org","","","","","","21680485","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042368543"

Several wind-tunnel tests were performed on a truss bridge deck section with different oncoming turbulent properties involving reduced turbulence intensities and turbulent scales. This study includes an investigation of the effect of oncoming flows on modal dynamic responses. The transient and buffeting response data from the wind-tunnel test are analyzed using the system identification technique in extracting FDs, and the difficulties involved in this method are discussed. The time-domain SSI is applied to extract all FDs simultaneously from one and two degree-of-freedom (1DOF and 2DOF) systems.

In this report, the photodegradation behaviors of PEs and an isolated J2 component were examined under UV/Vis <inf>254–575nm</inf> irradiation (power 0.4–120 W/m2) and natural sunlight (maximum power of 800–1100 W/m2) in aqueous solution. The J2 was selectively degraded when it was irradiated with UV<inf>254–280nm</inf>. The photodegradation of the PEs occurred with first order kinetics, and the rate constants of J2 and PEs under UV<inf>254nm</inf> irradiation were 1.78 × 10−2 and 2.41 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. The rate constant of the PEs under natural sunlight was 1.37 × 10−3 s−1. Characterization by high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the degradation process was preceded by the isomerization of the conjugated unsaturated diester group of the PEs, followed by disruption of the phorbol skeleton. These results indicate that PEs can be selectively degraded in aqueous solution by UV<inf>254–280nm</inf> and/or Vis<inf>545–575nm</inf> irradiation. The aqueous waste streams contaminated with PEs that are generated during biodiesel production could therefore be detoxified by degradation under UV<inf>254nm</inf> light and natural sunlight. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","12-deoxy-13,16-dioxy Phorbol Esters; Aqueous Environment; Degradation Kinetic Reaction Rate; Photo-isomerization; Photodegradation; Degradation; Esters; High Performance Liquid Chromatography; Irradiation; Isomerization; Isomers; Liquid Chromatography; Mass Spectrometry; Oils And Fats; Photodegradation; Rate Constants; Seed; Aqueous Environment; Biodiesel Production; Degradation Kinetics; Degradation Process; First Order Kinetics; Natural Sunlight; Phorbol Esters; Toxic Compounds; Solutions","Degradation; Esters; High performance liquid chromatography; Irradiation; Isomerization; Isomers; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Oils and fats; Photodegradation; Rate constants; Seed; Aqueous environment; Biodiesel production; Degradation kinetics; Degradation process; First order kinetics; Natural sunlight; Phorbol esters; Toxic compounds; Solutions","","","This study was financially supported by Science and Technology Research Partnerships for Sustainable Development ( SATREP : Multi-beneficial Measure for the Mitigation of Climate Change by the Integrated Utilization of Biomass Energy in Vietnam and Indochina countries) project and Matsuda Yosahichi Memorial Foreign Student Scholarship Foundation .","Haas, Wilhelm, Novel 12-deoxy-16-hydroxyphorbol diesters isolated from the seed oil of Jatropha curcas, Journal of Natural Products, 65, 10, pp. 1434-1440, (2002); Lim, Steven, Recent trends, opportunities and challenges of biodiesel in Malaysia: An overview, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 14, 3, pp. 938-954, (2010); Guebitz, Georg M., Exploitation of the tropical oil seed plant Jatropha curcas L., Bioresource Technology, 67, 1, pp. 73-82, (1999); Koh, May Ying, A review of biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas L. oil, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, 5, pp. 2240-2251, (2011); Balat, Mustafa, Potential alternatives to edible oils for biodiesel production - A review of current work, Energy Conversion and Management, 52, 2, pp. 1479-1492, (2011); Chyuan, Ong Hwai, Production and comparative fuel properties of biodiesel from non-edible oils: Jatropha curcas, Sterculia foetida and Ceiba pentandra, Energy Conversion and Management, 73, pp. 245-255, (2013); Kumar, Rohit, Hydroprocessing of jatropha oil and its mixtures with gas oil, Green Chemistry, 12, 12, pp. 2232-2239, (2010); Baird, William M., Tumor-Promoting Activity Of Phorbol And Four Diesters Of Phorbol In Mouse Skin 1, Cancer Research, 31, 8, pp. 1074-1079, (1971); Schmidt, Richard J., Skin irritant effects of esters of phorbol and related polyols, Archives of Toxicology, 44, 4, pp. 279-289, (1980); Goel, Gunjan, Phorbol esters: Structure, biological activity, and toxicity in animals, International Journal of Toxicology, 26, 4, pp. 279-288, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22133437","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034849159"

Each threshold was measured in terms of sound pressure at fundamental frequency. Broadband noise emitted from acoustic cavitation bubbles was detected by a hydrophone to determine the cavitation threshold. Potassium iodide oxidation caused by acoustic cavitation was used to quantify the chemical effect threshold. The ultrasonic erosion of aluminum foil was conducted to estimate the mechanical effect threshold. The cavitation, chemical effect, and mechanical effect thresholds increased with increasing frequency. The chemical effect threshold was close to the cavitation threshold for all frequencies. At low frequency below 98 kHz, the mechanical effect threshold was nearly equal to the cavitation threshold. However, the mechanical effect threshold was greatly higher than the cavitation threshold at high frequency. In addition, the thresholds of the second harmonic and the first ultraharmonic signals were measured to detect bubble occurrence. The threshold of the second harmonic approximated to the cavitation threshold below 1000 kHz. On the other hand, the threshold of the first ultraharmonic was higher than the cavitation threshold below 98 kHz and near to the cavitation threshold at high frequency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aluminum Foil Erosion; Broadband Noise; Cavitation Threshold; Harmonic; Potassium Iodide; Ultraharmonic; Potassium Iodide; Acoustic Noise; Aluminum Foil; Erosion; Harmonic Analysis; Potassium Iodide; Ultrasonic Applications; Broadband Noise; Cavitation Thresholds; Fundamental Frequencies; Harmonic; Potassium Iodide Oxidations; Ultraharmonic; Ultrasonic Frequency; Wide Frequency Range; Cavitation; Potassium Iodide; Acoustics; Aluminum Foil; Analytical Parameters; Article; Cavitation; Frequency; Mechanics; Noise Measurement; Oxidation; Priority Journal; Sound Pressure; Ultrasound","Acoustic noise; Aluminum foil; Erosion; Harmonic analysis; Potassium iodide; Ultrasonic applications; Broadband noise; Cavitation thresholds; Fundamental frequencies; Harmonic; Potassium iodide oxidations; Ultraharmonic; Ultrasonic frequency; Wide frequency range; Cavitation; potassium iodide; acoustics; aluminum foil; analytical parameters; Article; cavitation; frequency; mechanics; noise measurement; oxidation; priority journal; sound pressure; ultrasound","","potassium iodide, 7681-11-0","","Luque de Castro, María Dolores, Ultrasound-assisted crystallization (sonocrystallization), Ultrasonics Sonochemistry, 14, 6, pp. 717-724, (2007); Palanisamy, Barath, The synthesis of cadmium sulfide nanoplatelets using a novel continuous flow sonochemical reactor, Ultrasonics Sonochemistry, 26, pp. 452-460, (2015); Xu, Zheng, Enhancement of sonochemical reaction by dual-pulse ultrasound, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Part 2: Letters, 50, 7 PART 2, (2011); Yotsumoto, Tatsuya, Influence of pressure and temperature on sonochemical reaction in a flow-type reactor equipped with a PZT transducer, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Part 2: Letters, 53, 7 SPEC.

This prospective study included 60 HIV-infected children—including 31 without antiretroviral therapy (ART) (HIV(+)) and 29 who received ART for a median of 3.5 years (ART(+)) and 20 children without HIV infection (HIV(−)). Participants were recruited in Vietnam. All children were given fermented milk containing LcS (6.5 × 109 cfu) daily for 8 weeks. Before and after LcS ingestion, blood samples were collected for virological, immunological, and bacteriological analyses. After LcS ingestion, peripheral CD4+ T-cell and Th2 (CXCR3−CCR6−CD4+) counts significantly increased in both HIV-infected groups; Th17 (CXCR3−CCR6+CD4+) counts increased in all three groups; regulatory T-cell (CD25highCD4+) counts decreased in the ART(+) and HIV(−) groups; activated CD8+ cells (CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+) decreased from 27.5% to 13.2% (p < 0.001) in HIV(+) children; and plasma HIV load decreased slightly but significantly among HIV(+) children. No group showed a significantly altered frequency of bacterial 16S/23S rRNA gene detection in the plasma. No serious adverse events occurred. These findings suggest that short-term LcS ingestion is a safe supportive approach with immunological and virological benefits in HIV-infected children. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","16s/23s Ribosomal Dna; Hiv-infected Children; Immune Activation; Intestinal Microbial Translocation; Probiotics; Alanine Aminotransferase; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Chemokine Receptor Ccr6; Hemoglobin; Alanine Aminotransferase; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Cd38 Antigen; Chemokine Receptor Ccr6; Chemokine Receptor Cxcr3; Dna 16s; Dna 23s; Hemoglobin; Hla Dr Antigen; Probiotic Agent; Rna 16s; Rna 23s; Antiretroviral Therapy; Article; Bacterial Translocation; Body Height; Body Weight; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; Cd4+ Cd25+ T Lymphocyte; Cd8+ T Lymphocyte; Child; Cholesterol Blood Level; Controlled Study; Diet Supplementation; Female; Fermented Milk Product; Glucose Blood Level; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Infection; Immunity; Infant; Intestine Flora; Lactobacillus Casei; Major Clinical Study; Male; Newborn; Open Study; Pediatrics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prospective Study; Rash; Regulatory T Lymphocyte; Th17 Cell; Th2 Cell; Thrombocyte Count; Vietnamese; Virus Load; Cd4 Cd8 Ratio; Controlled Clinical Trial; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Immunology; Microbiology; Preschool Child; Viet Nam; Cd4-cd8 Ratio; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Hiv Infections; Hiv-1; Humans; Male; Probiotics; Th17 Cells; Th2 Cells; Vietnam","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; CD38 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR6; chemokine receptor CXCR3; DNA 16S; DNA 23S; hemoglobin; HLA DR antigen; probiotic agent; RNA 16S; RNA 23S; antiretroviral therapy; Article; bacterial translocation; body height; body weight; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; child; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diet supplementation; female; fermented milk product; glucose blood level; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; immunity; infant; intestine flora; Lactobacillus casei; major clinical study; male; newborn; open study; pediatrics; polymerase chain reaction; prospective study; rash; regulatory T lymphocyte; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; thrombocyte count; Vietnamese; virus load; CD4 CD8 ratio; controlled clinical trial; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; microbiology; preschool child; Viet Nam; CD4-CD8 Ratio; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Male; Probiotics; Th17 Cells; Th2 Cells; Vietnam","","alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; chemokine receptor CCR6, 287981-77-5; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0","Acknowledgments: The authors are grateful to the children who participated in this study for their invaluable support through allowing the use of their samples, to Thuy Thi Thanh Giang, Thuy Thi Bich Phung, Tuyen Thi Nguyen, An Nhat Pham, and other staff of the Departments of Infectious Diseases and Molecular Laboratory of NHP who made enormous contributions to this work, and to Kiyohito Ogata who conducted bacteriological analyses at the Yakult Central Institute (Tokyo, Japan).

It has been produced by the hydrolysis of γ-oryzanol found in rice bran oil soapstock. In this study, the base-catalyzed, homogenous hydrolysis of γ-oryzanol was conducted using various ratios of potassium hydroxide (KOH) to γ-oryzanol, initial concentrations of γ-oryzanol in the reaction mixture, and ratios of ethanol (EtOH) (as cosolvent)/ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (γ-oryzanol solution). Acceleration of the reaction using a planar type of ultrasound sonicator (78 and 130 kHz) at different reaction temperatures was explored. By using a heating method, the 80% yield of FA was attained at 75 C in 4 h under homogeneous conditions (initial concentration of γ-oryzanol 12 mg/mL, the KOH/γ-oryzanol ratio (wt/wt) 10/1, and EtOH/EtOAc ratio (v/v) 5/1). With the assistance of 78 and 130 kHz irradiation, the yields reached 90%. The heating method was applied for the γ-oryzanol-containing extract prepared from rice bran oil soapstock. From soapstock, the 74.3% yield of FA was obtained, but 20% of the trans-FA in the reaction mixture was transformed into cis-form within one month. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cis-trans; Ferulic Acid; Homogeneous Reaction; Isomerization; Soapstock; Ultrasound-assisted Hydrolysis; Γ Oryzanol","","","","","Graf, Ernst, Antioxidant potential of ferulic acid, Free Radical Biology and Medicine, 13, 4, pp. 435-448, (1992); Saija, Antonina, In vitro and in vivo evaluation of caffeic and ferulic acids as topical photoprotective agents, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 199, 1, pp. 39-47, (2000); Itagaki, Shirou, In vitro and in vivo antioxidant properties of ferulic acid: A comparative study with other natural oxidation inhibitors, Food Chemistry, 114, 2, pp. 466-471, (2009); Mussatto, Solange I., Ferulic and p-coumaric acids extraction by alkaline hydrolysis of brewer's spent grain, Industrial Crops and Products, 25, 2, pp. 231-237, (2007); Rajendra Prasad, N., Ferulic acid inhibits UV-B-induced oxidative stress in human lymphocytes, Nutrition Research, 27, 9, pp. 559-564, (2007); Mancuso, Cesare, Ferulic acid: Pharmacological and toxicological aspects, Food and Chemical Toxicology, 65, pp. 185-195, (2014); Yan-Ying, Yu, Extraction of Ferulic Acid and Caffeic Acid with Ionic Liquids, Chinese Journal of Analytical Chemistry, 35, 12, pp. 1726-1730, (2007); Srinivasan, Marimuthu S., Influence of ferulic acid on γ-radiation induced DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in primary culture of isolated rat hepatocytes, Toxicology, 228, 2-3, pp. 249-258, (2006); Woranuch, Sarekha, Preparation, characterization and antioxidant property of water-soluble ferulic acid grafted chitosan, Carbohydrate Polymers, 96, 2, pp. 495-502, (2013); Zhao, Zhaohui, Chemistry, natural sources, dietary intake and pharmacokinetic properties of ferulic acid: A review, Food Chemistry, 109, 4, pp. 691-702, (2008)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026778137"

In this paper, a novel partial 15N-labeling method for the amide backbone of a synthetic glycoprotein is proposed. Using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and native chemical ligation (NCL), thirteen 15N-labeled amino acids were inserted at specific positions of the protein backbone, while intentionally varying the enrichment of 15N atoms. This idea discriminated even the same type of amino acid based on the intensities of 1H-15N HSQC signals, combined with classic homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY methods, thus allowing for understanding the dynamics of the local conformation of a synthetic homogeneous glycoprotein. Results suggested that the attachment of an oligosaccharide of either a bi-antennary complex-type or a high-mannose-type did not disturb protein conformation.

In the district, irrigation agriculture is performed through channels, in addition, there are two industrial parks are nearby agricultural land. The purpose of the study is to clarify the magnitude and spatial distribution of the trace metal concentrations, the source of the trace metals, the difference in the concentrations between the two industrial park areas, and usability of soils for agriculture. As a result, the trace metal concentrations were in the order of Cr>Zn>Pb>Cu>As>Cd for the district. No significant differences were observed between the two park areas in concentrations. Cr and Zn concentrations were high near factories in the park areas, and the other concentrations were comparatively high in the areas, showing that the trace metals were supplied from the factories with wastewaters. The correlations observed between Cd, Pb and Zn, between Cr and Zn, and between Cu and as in the concentrations suggested that there were several groups of wastewaters supplying the trace metals. Concentrations of all kinds trace metals exceeded the permissible level for agricultural soils, and the remediation measures to reduce contamination are necessary. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Soils; Industrial Wastewater; Irrigation Water; Soil Contamination; Toxic Trace Metals; Agricultural Soil; Concentration (composition); Industrial District; Industrial Location; Spatial Distribution; Trace Metal; Wastewater; Viet Nam","agricultural soil; concentration (composition); industrial district; industrial location; spatial distribution; trace metal; wastewater; Viet Nam","","","","Initial Environmental Examination, (2011); Elbana, Tamer A., Heavy metals accumulation and spatial distribution in long term wastewater irrigated soils, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 1, 4, pp. 925-933, (2013); Huong, Nguyen Thi Lan, Heavy-metal contamination of soil and vegetables in wastewater-irrigated agricultural soil in a suburban area of Hanoi, Vietnam, Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis, 41, 4, pp. 390-407, (2010); Kabata-Pendias, Alina, Trace elements in soils and plants: Fourth edition, pp. 1-520, (2010); Li, Peijun, Risk assessment of heavy metals in soil previously irrigated with industrial wastewater in Shenyang, China, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 161, 1, pp. 516-521, (2009); Liang, Peng, The effects of mariculture on heavy metal distribution in sediments and cultured fish around the Pearl River Delta region, south China, Chemosphere, 148, pp. 171-177, (2016); Mahmoud, Esawy Kasem, Effect of polluted water on soil and plant contamination by heavy metals in El-Mahla El-Kobra, Egypt, Solid Earth, 7, 2, pp. 703-711, (2016); Mani, Dinesh, Biotechnological advances in bioremediation of heavy metals contaminated ecosystems: An overview with special reference to phytoremediation, International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 11, 3, pp. 843-872, (2014); National Technical Regulation on the Allowable Limits of Heavy Metals in the Soil, (2008); Nguyen, Phuongthao, Levels and chemical forms of heavy metals in soils from red river delta, Vietnam, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 207, 1-4, pp. 319-332, (2010)","","Research and Reviews rktem@pn3.vsnl.net.in","","","","","","09702083","","JIPCE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035321248"

Gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed that only the strain NVL3 degraded synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) into low-molecular-weight intermediates among the three strains found in the H2DA. The 16S-rRNA gene sequence of NVL3 showed the highest identity with that of Nocardia farcinica DSM 43665T. NVL3 accumulated aldehyde intermediates from synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) on a rubber-overlay plate as indicated by Schiff's staining. NVL3 also degraded deproteinized natural rubber into low-molecular-weight aldehyde intermediates. A latex-clearing protein (lcp) gene ortholog was identified within the genome sequence of NVL3, and it showed a moderate amino-acid identity (54–75%) with the lcp genes from previously reported rubber degraders. The heterologous expression of the NVL3 lcp in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) allowed us to purify the 46.8-kDa His-tagged lcp gene product (His-Lcp). His-Lcp degraded synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) and accumulated aldehyde intermediates from deproteinized natural rubber suggesting the functional expression of the lcp gene from a Nocardia degrader in E. coli. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis indicated the strong transcriptional induction of the lcp gene in NVL3 in the presence of synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene). These results suggest the involvement of the lcp gene in rubber degradation in NVL3. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Degradation; Functional Expression; Latex-clearing Protein; Nocardia; Rubber; Amino Acid; Isoprene; Rubber; 1,4-polyisoprene; Aldehydes; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber; Aldehydes; Degradation; Escherichia Coli; Gel Permeation Chromatography; Gene Expression; Latexes; Molecular Weight; Proteins; Rna; Rubber; Synthetic Rubber; Transcription; 16s Rrna Gene Sequence; Escherichia Coli Bl21; Functional Expression; Heterologous Expression; Natural Rubber Latex; Nocardia; Poly(cis-1 ,4-isoprene); Reverse Transcription Pcr; Genes; Aldehyde; Amino Acid; Isoprene; Latex; Poly(1,4 Isoprene); Ribosome Rna; Rna 16s; Rubber; Unclassified Drug; 1,4-polyisoprene; Hemiterpene; Article; Controlled Study; Degradation; Enrichment Culture; Gel Permeation Chromatography; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Induction; Gene Sequence; Genetic Transcription; Heterologous Expression; Lcp Gene; Molecular Weight; Nocardia Farcinica; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Quantitative Analysis; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rubber Industry; Viet Nam; Bacterial Gene; Chemistry; Classification; Genetics; Industry; Metabolism; Base Sequence; Genes, Bacterial; Hemiterpenes; Industry; Latex; Vietnam","Aldehydes; Degradation; Escherichia coli; Gel permeation chromatography; Gene expression; Latexes; Molecular weight; Proteins; RNA; Rubber; Synthetic rubber; Transcription; 16S rRNA gene sequence; Escherichia coli bl21; Functional expression; Heterologous expression; Natural rubber latex; Nocardia; Poly(cis-1 ,4-isoprene); Reverse transcription PCR; Genes; aldehyde; amino acid; isoprene; latex; poly(1,4 isoprene); ribosome RNA; RNA 16S; rubber; unclassified drug; 1,4-polyisoprene; hemiterpene; Article; controlled study; degradation; enrichment culture; gel permeation chromatography; gene; gene expression; gene induction; gene sequence; genetic transcription; heterologous expression; lcp gene; molecular weight; Nocardia farcinica; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rubber industry; Viet Nam; bacterial gene; chemistry; classification; genetics; industry; metabolism; Base Sequence; Genes, Bacterial; Hemiterpenes; Industry; Latex; Vietnam","GENBANK: KX064785, KX529888, KX529889, KX529890","amino acid, 65072-01-7; isoprene, 78-79-5; rubber, 9006-04-6; 1,4-polyisoprene; Aldehydes; Hemiterpenes; Latex; Rubber","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam and Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam.

The front-tracking/finite difference method is used together with an interpolation technique for solving the phase change process. Evolution of the solidifying interface is followed by the front-tracking, and the interpolation handles the presence of the solid phase and the no-slip and constant isothermal boundary conditions. The effects of various non-dimensional parameters on the evolution of the solid phase such as the Reynolds number Re, the Stefan number St, the dimensionless temperature of the inflowing liquid θ<inf>0</inf>, the ratios of the thermal properties k<inf>sl</inf> and C<inf>psl</inf>, and the distance between two cylinders L are studied. The computational results show that the solidified region expands with an increase in k<inf>sl</inf> or L, or with a decrease in any one of Re, Pr, θ<inf>0</inf>.

In this study, the authors present a study on reducing air resistance acting on a ship by using interaction effects between the hull and an accommodation. At first, air resistances acting on a hull and an accommodation of the ship are investigated by a commercial Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code. Then, CFD results are compared with those of experimental results to validate the accuracy of the CFD. Secondly, air resistances acting on the ship with an accommodation on its deck are computed to obtain air resistances acting on the whole ships, on the hull and on accommodation. The results demonstrate that the interaction effects between the hull and its accommodation house be also shown how to reduce the total air resistance by using interaction effects between the hull and an accommodation house. The results can be applied in reducing the total resistances acting on a ship. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accommodation House; Air Resistance; Cfd; Hull; Interaction Effects; Saving Energy","","","","","Journal of the Kansan Society of Naval Architects, (2003); Proc 4th Asia Pacific Workshop on Marine Hydrodynamics Aphydro 08, (2008); Fujiwara, Toshifumi, Experimental investigation and estimation on wind forces for a container ship, Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, pp. 555-562, (2009); Proceedings of the 5th Asia Pacific Workshop on Marine Hydrodynamics Aphydro2010, (2010); Proceedings of the 16th Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineering, (2013); Proceedings of the 16th Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineering, (2013); Proceedings of the 18th Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineering, (2014); Practical Used Guideline for Ship Cfd Application, (2011); Application of Cfd to Optimization of Hydrodynamic Performances of Nonballast Ships Ph D Thesis, (2013)","","ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network","","","","","","25869159","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073567467"

Since the country's budget is inadequate for investing in all necessary infrastructure projects, the Vietnam government has been inviting other economic sectors, especially the private sector, to participate in infrastructure development. The cooperation between the government agencies and the private entities, called Public-Private Partnership (PPP), must encounter various challenges leading to difficulties in attracting private investors. A main reason is that private investors must deal with critical risks concerning PPP investment environment. It is a challenging task for the government to optimally manage such risks to enhance the attractiveness of PPP projects for private investors. This paper examines the critical risk factors that influence the private sector's investment decisions on PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Risk factors inherent in typical PPP projects were compiled by comprehensive literature review. To reflect unique characteristics of PPP projects in Vietnam, the compiled risk factors were reviewed by a group of PPP experts from both the public and private sectors in Vietnam through in-depth interviews and questionnaire surveys. In addition, ten PPP project case studies in Vietnam were analyzed to derive the risk profile of PPP transportation projects of the nation. These risk factors were quantitatively assessed based on their probabilities and impact levels. We found that the critical risk factors of PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam are acquisition/compensation problems, approvals and permits, inadequate feasibility studies, finance market issues, subjective evaluation methods, and change in laws and regulations. By performing factor analysis, these critical risk factors were grouped into four categories: (1) bidding process, (2) finance issues, (3) laws and regulations, and (4) project evaluation issues. These critical risk factors represent the obstacles that repel private investors from PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Thus, the Vietnam government agencies should meticulously address these issues to attract both domestic and foreign private investors in PPP projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors would like to thank the ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net), Chulalongkorn University, Kyoto University, and Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology for their financial support to this paper.","Public Private Partnership in Infrastructure Development Case Studies from Asia and Europe, (2009); Nguyen, Longduy, Large construction projects in developing countries: A case study from Vietnam, International Journal of Project Management, 22, 7, pp. 553-561, (2004); Thomas, Anu V., Modelling and assessment of critical risks in BOT road projects, Construction Management and Economics, 24, 4, pp. 407-424, (2006); Li, Bing, Critical success factors for PPP/PFI projects in the UK construction industry, Construction Management and Economics, 23, 5, pp. 459-471, (2005); Revival of Private Participation in Developing Country Infrastructure A Look at Recent Trends and Policy Implications, (2007); Flyvbjerg, Bent, Underestimating costs in public works projects: Error or lie?, Journal of the American Planning Association, 68, 3, pp. 279-295, (2002); Public Private Partnerships in Infrastructure Best Practices from International Experience and Applications for Thailand, (2008); Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Jabnoun, Naceur, Measuring perceived service quality at UAE commercial banks, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 20, 4, pp. 458-472, (2003); Analysis of the Malaysian Toll Road Public Private Partnership Program and Recommendations for Policy Improvements, (2005)","","ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network","","","","","","25869159","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073551609"

Using pneumatic cylinders with different sizes, an experimental setup is built to measure friction force-displacement characteristics in presliding regime under various conditions of pressures in the cylinder chambers. A new mathematical model of friction for the pneumatic cylinders is proposed by incorporating a hysteresis function into the new modified LuGre model. The experimental results show that when the pressures are varied, friction of the pneumatic cylinders in pre-sliding regime is represented by behavior of a nonlinear spring. In addition, hysteresis behavior with nonlocal memory is obtained in the friction force-displacement characteristics and that the size of the hysteresis loop is increased with increasing pressures in the cylinder chambers. The simulation results show that the new friction model can accurately simulate the friction behavior of the pneumatic cylinders in pre-sliding regime as well as sliding regime. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fluid Power Actuator; Friction Behavior; Friction Model; Pneumatic Cylinder; Pre-sliding","","","","This research was funded by Collaborative Research Program for Alumni Members (CRA), AUN/SEED-Net, JICA under grant numbers HUST CRA 1401 and HUST CRA 1501.","Hibi, Akira, MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE TORQUE CHARACTERISTICS FOR HYDRAULIC MOTORS., Bulletin of the JSME, 20, 143, pp. 616-621, (1977); Schroeder, Lee E., Experimental study of friction in a pneumatic actuator at constant velocity, Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control, 115, 3, pp. 575-577, (1993); Belforte, Guido, Measurement of Friction Force in Pneumatic Cylinders, Tribo Test, 10, 1, pp. 33-48, (2003); Abcm Symposium Series in Mechatronics, (2006); Nouri, Bashir M.Y., Friction identification in mechatronic systems, ISA Transactions, 43, 2, pp. 205-216, (2004); Yanada, Hideki, Modeling of dynamic behaviors of friction, Mechatronics, 18, 7, pp. 330-339, (2008); Canudas-de-Wit, Carlos, A New Model for Control of Systems with Friction, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 40, 3, pp. 419-425, (1995); Trans Jpn Fluid Power Syst Soc, (2010); Tran, Xuan Bo, Modeling of dynamic friction behaviors of hydraulic cylinders, Mechatronics, 22, 1, pp. 65-75, (2012); Intelligent Control and Automation, (2013)","","ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network","","","","","","25869159","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073504137"

Based on a questionnaire survey in Vietnam, the most concern factors of private investors are their own capacity, demand issues, legal and political risks, long-term income, and financial sources issues of the PPP project. Moreover, five factors that represent the significant differences between the private and public sectors including political risks, enhancement of company's strength in its industry, construction risks, demand issues, and financial viability of the company are also discovered. Addressing the different perceptions is indispensable to ensure the public sector can establish necessary policies that appeal to both domestic and foreign private investors.

The corrosion rate of CS and WS after first year exposure were determined and classified according to ISO standard. The effects of environmental factors to corrosion rate of the steels were analyzed, which showed the increasing corrosion rate of the steels with air temperature when the temperature is lower than 19oC and the decreasing corrosion rate with air temperature when temperature is higher than 19oC. This phenomenon in Asia is different from temperate areas where corrosion rate gets peak at about 10oC. The comparison between the first-year corrosion rates of CS and WS are given in the paper. Especially, the corrosion rates of CS calculated by ISO dose-function and determined by exposure test were compared. The results showed that the actual measured values in almost test sites were higher than the estimated values. Therefore it is confirmed that an estimation formula suited to the Asian regions is needed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Airborne Salinity; Dose Function; Exposure Test; So2 Deposition Rate; Atmospheric Corrosion; Atmospheric Humidity; Atmospheric Temperature; Corrosion Rate; Corrosive Effects; Deposition Rates; Iso Standards; Weathering Steel; Air Temperature; Airborne Salinity; Atmospheric Corrosion Behavior; Environmental Factors; Environmental Parameter; Estimation Formulae; Exposure Tests; Measured Values; Steel Corrosion","Atmospheric corrosion; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Corrosion rate; Corrosive effects; Deposition rates; ISO Standards; Weathering steel; Air temperature; Airborne salinity; Atmospheric corrosion behavior; Environmental factors; Environmental parameter; Estimation formulae; Exposure tests; Measured values; Steel corrosion","","","This work has been accomplished with sponsor of JST/Japan, MOST/Vietnam and NSTDA/Thailand; the authors would like to thank these supports.

The effects of ultrasonic frequency, initial monosilicic acid concentration, pH, concentration, particle diameter and pore size of the silica gel on the removal ratio of silicic acid were examined. For comparison, stirring without and with silica gel, and ultrasonication with the addition of hydrogen peroxide or t-butanol were performed. Ultrasonication enhances the removal of silicic acid by silica gel seed. Ultrasonication at 500 kHz was more effective for the removal of silicic acid than ultrasonication at 28 kHz and stirring. The removal ratio of silicic acid increased with an increase in silica gel concentration. The small seed particle diameter of 60 μm and large seed pore size of 7 nm performed well in the removal of silicic acid. When the initial concentration of monosilicic acid was 1.1 g/L and the silica gel concentration was 1.5 g/L, the removal ratio of silicic acid was highest at pH 6 because the reaction between polymer and polymer is dominant. However, in the case of an initial monosilicic acid concentration of 0.5 g/L, the removal ratio was highest at pH 9 because reaction between polymer and monomer is dominant. The polymerization rate of monosilicic acid was increased by the addition of hydrogen peroxide due to a higher formation rate of hydroxide radicals.

The effects of the polymer solution concentration (and hence the viscosity), the spinneret rotational rate, and the internal needle diameter on the formation and morphology of the fibers were examined, using scanning electron microscopy. A rotational speed of 3000 rpm and an internal nozzle diameter of 0.35 mm (23 G) in conjunction with a polymer concentration of 15 wt% produced 6-nitro BIPS/PMMA Forcespinning fibers having a smooth morphology with no beads. The photochromic properties of the resultant fibers were characterized by reflectance spectroscopy using the Kubelka-Munk function, fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. The thermal decoloration dynamics of the 6-nitro BIPS in the PMMA fibers were in good agreement with the properties observed in films.

The batch analysis revealed that about 50% of the organics was possible to be degraded into methane whilst the rest was biologically inert and composed of mostly lignin. Based on the experiment a kinetic model composed of 14 kinds of soluble substances and 5 kinds of anaerobic microorganisms was developed. The model was used to simulate the process performance of a continuous anaerobic bioreactor with MLSS concentration at 2500–15,000 mg/L. The simulation indicated that the bioreactor could receive the influent until 0.4 kg-COD/kg-MLSS/d of loading without significant deterioration of methane conversion.

In this study, we developed a simple colorimetric paper-based biosensor based on a novel principle for the detection of antibiotics inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, including aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and macrolides. This biosensor is based on the detection of a color change induced by β-galactosidase, which is synthesized on freeze-dried paper discs containing an in vitro transcription/translation system. When a water sample without antibiotics is applied to the paper discs, β-galactosidase can be synthesized, and it hydrolyzes a colorimetric substrate, resulting in a color change from yellow to purple. By contrast, in the presence of antibiotics, the color change can be hampered due to an inhibition of β-galactosidase synthesis. We investigated the effect of the incubation temperature and pH of water samples and confirmed that the paper discs showed the color change to purple in the ranges of 15–37°C and pH 6–10. We observed concentration-dependent color variations of the paper discs by the naked eye and further estimated detection limits to be 0.5, 2.1, 0.8, and 6.1 μg/mL for paromomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin, respectively, using digitized pictures. The paper-based biosensor proved to detect 0.5 μg/mL paromomycin, spiked in real environmental water samples, by the naked eye. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cell-free Protein Synthesis; Chloramphenicol; Chlorophenol Red-β-d-galactopyranoside; Environmental Water; Erythromycin; Paper-based Biosensor; Paromomycin; Resistant Bacteria; Tetracycline; Β-galactosidase; Beta Galactosidase; Chloramphenicol; Erythromycin; Paromomycin; Tetracycline; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biosensors; Biosynthesis; Color; Proteins; Substrates; Cell Free Protein Synthesis; Chloramphenicol; Environmental Water; Erythromycin; Galactopyranoside; Galactosidases; Paromomycin; Resistant Bacteria; Tetracycline; Colorimetry; Bacterial Enzyme; Beta Galactosidase; Chloramphenicol; Erythromycin; Paromomycin; Tetracycline; Antiinfective Agent; Bacterial Protein; Article; Biosensor; Color; Colorimetry; Controlled Study; Drug Determination; Enzyme Inhibition; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Enzyme Synthesis; In Vitro Study; Incubation Temperature; Limit Of Detection; Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Paper; Ph; Water Sampling; Bacterium; Biosynthesis; Drug Effects; Genetic Procedures; Metabolism; Procedures; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Biosensing Techniques","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biosensors; Biosynthesis; Color; Proteins; Substrates; Cell free protein synthesis; Chloramphenicol; Environmental water; Erythromycin; Galactopyranoside; Galactosidases; Paromomycin; Resistant bacteria; Tetracycline; Colorimetry; bacterial enzyme; beta galactosidase; chloramphenicol; erythromycin; paromomycin; tetracycline; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; Article; biosensor; color; colorimetry; controlled study; drug determination; enzyme inhibition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme synthesis; in vitro study; incubation temperature; limit of detection; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; paper; pH; water sampling; bacterium; biosynthesis; drug effects; genetic procedures; metabolism; procedures; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Biosensing Techniques","","beta galactosidase; chloramphenicol, 134-90-7, 2787-09-9, 56-75-7; erythromycin, 114-07-8, 70536-18-4; paromomycin, 11035-13-5, 1263-89-4, 1390-73-4, 51795-47-2, 54597-56-7, 7542-37-2, 84420-34-8; tetracycline, 23843-90-5, 60-54-8, 64-75-5, 8021-86-1; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins","We thank Dr. K.

In this study, SBK was derived from the saponification and dercarboxylation of coconut oil, and consists predominantly of n-paraffins with carbon chain lengths from C7 to C17. Dodecane, butylcyclohexane and butylbenzene were chosen as surrogate components for n-paraffins in SBK, cycloparaffins and aromatics, respectively. The total soot volume was measured from the light extinction at ambient conditions in a wick-fed laminar diffusion flame. The measured smoke point of the fuel was correlated with the required sooting tendency according to the jet fuel standard. The freezing point was measured using the JIS K2276 test method. The results show that butylcyclohexane affects the sooting tendency much lesser than butylbenzene when blended with SBK or dodecane. In contrast, butylcyclohexane decreases the freezing point more, as compared to butylbenzene, when blended with dodecane. Butylcyclohexane and butylbenzene have a similar trend of effect on the freezing point when blended with SBK or dodecane. Blending SBK or dodecane with butylcyclohexane matches the requirements of both smoke point and freezing point for jet fuel specified by ASTM D1655. Conversely, blending SBK or dodecane with butylbenzene does not meet these requirements. Therefore, given the tradeoff between sooting tendency and freezing point, cycloparaffins are considered more promising than aromatics for blending with SBK or n-paraffin fuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aromatics; Cycloparaffins; Freezing Point; Normal Paraffins; Soap-derived Biokerosene; Sooting Tendency; Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Blending; Carbon; Fuels; Jet Fuel; Light Extinction; Paraffins; Testing; Ambient Conditions; Aromatics; Carbon-chain Length; Cycloparaffins; Experimental Investigations; Freezing Point; Laminar Diffusion Flames; Sooting Tendency; Freezing","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Blending; Carbon; Fuels; Jet fuel; Light extinction; Paraffins; Testing; Ambient conditions; Aromatics; Carbon-chain length; Cycloparaffins; Experimental investigations; Freezing point; Laminar diffusion flames; Sooting tendency; Freezing","","","We gratefully acknowledge the ASEAN University Network Southeast Asian Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net) project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for financial support.

The field variables approximation is performed on the way of taking both the nodal values and their averaged nodal gradients into account, in terms of the consecutive-interpolation procedure (CIP). The new CTH4 element proposed inherently possesses many desirable advantages over the conventional tetrahedral element (TH4) such as the higher accuracy, higher-order continuity, and continuous nodal gradients without smoothing operation. Importantly, the number of degrees of freedom of the system does not change, but still remains the nodal values as that of the TH4 element. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the developed CTH4 element through a series of numerical experiments of 3D heat transfer problems, in which comparison between the present obtained results and reference solutions derived from analytical solutions and other numerical approaches is made. We additionally propose a general formulation of auxiliary functions in terms of the CIP method. As a result, a family of CIP-based elements in all dimensions (i.e., 1D up to 3D) can now straightforwardly be estabilshed since any auxiliary functions required by the CIP scheme are easily to be generated by using the present general formulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d; Consecutive-interpolation Element; Fem; Heat Transfer; Tetrahedral Element; Degrees Of Freedom (mechanics); Finite Element Method; Interpolation; Consecutive-interpolation Element; Heat Transfer Analysis; Heat Transfer Problems; Number Of Degrees Of Freedom; Numerical Approaches; Numerical Experiments; Tetrahedral Elements; Tetrahedral Finite Elements; Heat Transfer","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Finite element method; Interpolation; Consecutive-interpolation element; Heat transfer analysis; Heat transfer problems; Number of degrees of freedom; Numerical approaches; Numerical experiments; Tetrahedral elements; Tetrahedral finite elements; Heat transfer","","","Tinh Quoc Bui was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research – JSPS.

Unlike the conventional unipolar-generators, this bipolar configuration creates an ion wind, which moves away from both electrodes and yields a very low net charge on the device. The electro-hydrodynamic behavior of air-flow has been experimentally and numerically studied. The velocity of ion wind reaches values up to 1.25 m/s using low discharge current 5 μA with the kinetic conversion efficiency of 0.65% and the released net charge of −30 fA, 8 orders of magnitude smaller compared with the discharge current. Due to easy scalability and low net charge, the present configuration is beneficial to applications with space constraints and/or where neutralized discharge process is required, such as inertial fluidic units, circulatory flow heat transfer, electrospun polymer nanofiber to overcome the intrinsically instability of the process, or the formation of low charged aerosol. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Simulation; Bipolar Corona Discharge; Electrohydrodynamics; Ion Wind; Neutralization; Openfoam; Air; Electric Corona; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; Heat Transfer; Ions; Negative Ions; Parallel Flow; 3d Simulations; Corona Discharges; Ion Wind; Neutralization; Openfoam; Electric Discharges","Air; Electric corona; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; Heat transfer; Ions; Negative ions; Parallel flow; 3D simulations; Corona discharges; Ion wind; Neutralization; OpenFOAM; Electric discharges","","","","Philos Mag, (1899); Aiee Trans, (1961); Leal Ferreira, Guilherme Fontes, Point-to-plane corona: Current-voltage characteristics for positive and negative polarity with evidence of an electronic component, Journal of Applied Physics, 59, 9, pp. 3045-3049, (1986); Moreau, Éric, Enhancing the mechanical efficiency of electric wind in corona discharges, Journal of Electrostatics, 66, 1-2, pp. 39-44, (2008); Kawamoto, Hiroyuki, Electrostatic micro-ozone fan that utilizes ionic wind induced in pin-to-plate corona discharge system, Journal of Electrostatics, 66, 7-8, pp. 445-454, (2008); Go, David B., Ionic winds for locally enhanced cooling, Journal of Applied Physics, 102, 5, (2007); Kim, Chul, Microscopic energy conversion process in the ion drift region of electrohydrodynamic flow, Applied Physics Letters, 100, 24, (2012); Shin, Dong Ho, Experimental optimization of ion wind generator with needle to parallel plates for cooling device, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 84, pp. 35-45, (2015); Chen, Ingyoung, Enhanced cooling for LED lighting using ionic wind, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 57, 1, pp. 285-291, (2013); Toyota, Hiroyuki, Gaseous electrical discharge characteristics in air and nitrogen at cryogenic temperature, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 9, 6, pp. 891-898, (2002)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","08941777","","ETFSE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976892389"

However, in the transparent thin film removal process, large thermal expansion or local phase change at the interface cannot be created by substrate side irradiation because of its large optical penetration depth compared to its small thickness. Nevertheless, substrate side irradiation works obviously for single shot film isolation process compared to film side irradiation, and the mechanism of the process was not clear in terms of difference in the irradiation direction. In order to investigate the effect of the irradiation direction, this study focused on the transient interaction between the material and nanosecond laser pulse. Experimental results showed that film was thermally ablated. Variation of temporal profile of nanosecond laser pulse during the process was experimentally investigated to detect plasma shielding. Pulse width and energy transmittance of transmitted pulse decreased by plasma shielding as pulse energy increases regardless of irradiation direction. In addition, temperature distribution in the film during the process was investigated using a 2-dimensional thermal model, which accounts for melting, vaporization, and laser induced plasma shielding. Calculated temperature distribution was used to support the scenario of the process mechanism which was investigated in the experiments. Our findings demonstrate that laser induced backward ablation is a single shot TCO film removal mechanism, and plasma shielding is dominant factor to interrupt absorption of beam thorough the film in the film side irradiation process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Laser Ablation; Nanosecond Laser Scribing; Plasma Shielding; Transparent Conductive Oxide Thin Film; Ablation; Film Thickness; Infrared Devices; Interfaces (materials); Irradiation; Laser Ablation; Laser Produced Plasmas; Laser Pulses; Radiation; Shielding; Temperature Distribution; Thermal Expansion; Laser Induced Plasma; Nanosecond Laser Pulse; Nanosecond Lasers; Optical Penetration Depth; Plasma Shielding; Transient Interactions; Transparent Conductive Oxide Thin Film; Transparent Thin Film; Thin Films","Ablation; Film thickness; Infrared devices; Interfaces (materials); Irradiation; Laser ablation; Laser produced plasmas; Laser pulses; Radiation; Shielding; Temperature distribution; Thermal expansion; Laser induced plasma; Nanosecond laser pulse; Nanosecond lasers; Optical penetration depth; Plasma shielding; Transient interactions; Transparent conductive oxide thin film; Transparent thin film; Thin films","","","Part of this work has been supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15J10556 and Amada Foundation .

In this research, new conical TSVs, 3 μm diameter and 27 μm depth (3 × 27 μm), were made. The flow pattern of the electrolyte inside a conical TSV and a cylindrical TSV is simulated with a TSV chip attached on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) rotating at 1000 rpm in the electrolyte. The flow pattern inside conical TSVs confirmed advantages of the conical shape over the cylindrical shape. The conical shape forms deeper vortexes and shows higher velocities at the same depth than the cylindrical shape. A character of electrolyte bases on anodic area charge was used to optimize electrolyte bath composition for the extreme fast filling. Without additives, the anodic area charge at 1000 rpm was larger than that at 10 rpm, however, the reverse obtained in the presence of additives. D-optimal designs for quantitative multilevel of additives were applied to create an experiment plan. The result confirmed a strong effect of Cl− concentration and interactions of Cl− with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and bis-(3-sodiumsulfopropyl)-disulfide (SPS) with sulfonated diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride copolymer (SDDACC) which bring to anodic area charge at 1000 rpm was smaller than that at 10 rpm.

Hence, if the hydrate conditions are well addressed, it is possible overcome hydrate-related problems. To that end, evolving an accurate and simple-to-apply approach for estimating gas hydrate formation is vitally important. In this contribution, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) approach has been developed based on Katz chart data points to estimate natural gas hydrate formation temperature as function of the pressure and gas gravity. In addition, a genetic algorithm has been employed to optimize hyper parameters of the LSSVM. Moreover, the present model has been compared with five popular correlations and was concluded that the LSSVM approach has fewer deviations than these correlations so to estimate hydrate formation temperature. According to statistical analyses, the obtained values of MSE and R2 were 0.278634 and 0.9973, respectively. This predictive tool is simple to apply and has great potential for estimating natural gas hydrate formation temperature and can be of immense value for engineers who deal with the natural gas utilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Correlation; Ga, Hydrate; Lssvm; Natural Gas; Temperature; Chemical Plants; Correlation Methods; Gas Plants; Gases; Genetic Algorithms; Hydration; Natural Gas; Natural Gas Well Production; Support Vector Machines; Temperature; Hydrate Formation; Hydrate Formation Temperatures; Least Square Support Vector Machines; Lssvm; Natural Gas Utility; Natural-gas Production; Phase Equilibriums; Predictive Tools; Gas Hydrates","Chemical plants; Correlation methods; Gas plants; Gases; Genetic algorithms; Hydration; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Support vector machines; Temperature; Hydrate formation; Hydrate formation temperatures; Least square support vector machines; LSSVM; Natural gas utility; Natural-gas production; Phase equilibriums; Predictive tools; Gas hydrates","","","","Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Evolving simple-to-apply models for estimating thermal conductivity of supercritical CO2, International Journal of Ambient Energy, 38, 3, pp. 300-307, (2017); Amedi, Hamid Reza, Evolving machine learning models to predict hydrogen sulfide solubility in the presence of various ionic liquids, Journal of Molecular Liquids, 216, pp. 411-422, (2016); Baghban, Alireza, Phase equilibrium modeling of semi-clathrate hydrates of seven commonly gases in the presence of TBAB ionic liquid promoter based on a low parameter connectionist technique, Journal of Supercritical Fluids, 101, pp. 184-192, (2015); Baghban, Alireza, Prediction carbon dioxide solubility in presence of various ionic liquids using computational intelligence approaches, Journal of Supercritical Fluids, 98, pp. 50-64, (2015); Baghban, Alireza, Estimation of air dew point temperature using computational intelligence schemes, Applied Thermal Engineering, 93, pp. 1043-1052, (2016); Bahadori, Alireza, Estimation of emission of hydrocarbons and filling losses in storage containers using intelligent models, Petroleum Science and Technology, 34, 2, pp. 145-152, (2016); Bahadori, Alireza, Computational intelligent strategies to predict energy conservation benefits in excess air controlled gas-fired systems, Applied Thermal Engineering, 102, pp. 432-446, (2016); Bahadori, Alireza, A novel correlation for estimation of hydrate forming condition of natural gases, Journal of Natural Gas Chemistry, 18, 4, pp. 453-457, (2009); Berge, Bent K., Hydrate predictions on a microcomputer, pp. 213-219, (1986); Carroll, John J., Acid gas injection: Another approach of acid gas treatment, Natural Gas Industry, 29, 10, pp. 96-100, (2009)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","15322459; 10916466","","PSTEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987638075"

To investigate the impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the immune profile of and microbial translocation in HIV-infected children, 60 HIV vertically infected children (31 without ART: HIV(+) and 29 with ART: ART(+)) and 20 HIV-uninfected children (HIV(–)) aged 2–12 years were recruited in Vietnam, and their blood samples were immunologically and bacteriologically analyzed. Among the HIV(+) children, the total CD4+-cell and their subset (type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)/Th2/Th17) counts were inversely correlated with age (all p < 0.05), whereas regulatory T-cell (Treg) counts and CD4/CD8 ratios had become lower, and the CD38+HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-DR+CD8+- (activated CD8+) cell percentage and plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14, a monocyte activation marker) levels had become higher than those of HIV(–) children by the age of 2 years; the CD4/CD8 ratio was inversely correlated with the plasma HIV RNA load and CD8+-cell activation status. Among the ART(+) children, the total CD4+-cell and Th2/Th17/Treg-subset counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio gradually increased, with estimated ART periods of normalization being 4.8–8.3 years, whereas Th1 counts and the CD8+-cell activation status normalized within 1 year of ART initiation. sCD14 levels remained high even after ART initiation. The detection frequency of bacterial 16S/23S ribosomal DNA/RNA in blood did not differ between HIV-infected and -uninfected children. Thus, in children, HIV infection caused a rapid decrease in Treg counts and the early activation of CD8+ cells and monocytes, and ART induced rapid Th1 recovery and early CD8+-cell activation normalization but had little effect on monocyte activation. The CD4/CD8 ratio could therefore be an additional marker for ART monitoring. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","16s/23s Ribosomal Dna; Hiv-infected Children; Immune Activation; Intestinal Microbial Translocation; Abacavir; Didanosine; Efavirenz; Lamivudine; Lopinavir; Nevirapine; Ritonavir; Stavudine; Zidovudine; Biomarkers; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Rna, Ribosomal, 23s; Abacavir; Cd14 Antigen; Cd38 Antigen; Cd4 Antigen; Didanosine; Dna 23s; Efavirenz; Lamivudine; Lopinavir; Nevirapine; Ribosome Dna; Ribosome Rna; Ritonavir; Stavudine; Zidovudine; Biological Marker; Rna 16s; Rna 23s; Article; Bacterial Translocation; Cd4 Cd8 Ratio; Cd4+ T Lymphocyte; Cell Activation; Cell Destruction; Child; Cross-sectional Study; Female; Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; Human; Human Cell; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Infection; Immune Status; Major Clinical Study; Male; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Regulatory T Lymphocyte; Th1 Cell; Th17 Cell; Th2 Cell; Viet Nam; Virus Load; Blood; Genetics; Hiv Infections; Immunology; Metabolism; Microbiology; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Bacterial Translocation; Biomarkers; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Rna, Ribosomal, 23s; Vietnam","abacavir; CD14 antigen; CD38 antigen; CD4 antigen; didanosine; DNA 23S; efavirenz; lamivudine; lopinavir; nevirapine; ribosome DNA; ribosome RNA; ritonavir; stavudine; zidovudine; biological marker; RNA 16S; RNA 23S; Article; bacterial translocation; CD4 CD8 ratio; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell activation; cell destruction; child; cross-sectional study; female; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; immune status; major clinical study; male; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; Viet Nam; virus load; blood; genetics; HIV Infections; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Bacterial Translocation; Biomarkers; Child; Female; Humans; Male; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA, Ribosomal, 23S; Vietnam","","abacavir, 136470-78-5, 188062-50-2; didanosine, 69655-05-6; efavirenz, 154598-52-4; lamivudine, 134678-17-4, 134680-32-3; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; nevirapine, 129618-40-2; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; stavudine, 3056-17-5; zidovudine, 30516-87-1; Biomarkers; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA, Ribosomal, 23S","","Mehandru, Saurabh, Primary HIV-1 infection is associated with preferential depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes from effector sites in the gastrointestinal tract, Journal of Experimental Medicine, 200, 6, pp. 761-770, (2004); Brenchley, Jason M., Differential Th17 CD4 T-cell depletion in pathogenic and nonpathogenic lentiviral infections, Blood, 112, 7, pp. 2826-2835, (2008); Hunt, Peter W., Th17, gut, and HIV: Therapeutic implications, Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS, 5, 2, pp. 189-193, (2010); Gordon, Shari N., Disruption of intestinal CD4+ T cell homeostasis is a key marker of systemic CD4+ T cell activation in HIV-infected individuals, Journal of Immunology, 185, 9, pp. 5169-5179, (2010); Estes, Jacob D., Damaged intestinal epithelial integrity linked to microbial translocation in pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus infections, PLOS Pathogens, 6, 8, pp. 49-50, (2010); Brenchley, Jason M., Microbial translocation is a cause of systemic immune activation in chronic HIV infection, Nature Medicine, 12, 12, pp. 1365-1371, (2006); Mehandru, Saurabh, Lack of mucosal immune reconstitution during prolonged treatment of acute and early HIV-1 infection, PLOS Medicine, 3, 12, pp. 2335-2348, (2006); Bi, Xiuqiong, High frequency and proliferation of CD4+FOXP3+ Treg in HIV-1-infected patients with low CD4 counts, European Journal of Immunology, 39, 1, pp. 301-309, (2009); Tobin, Nicole H., Immunology Of Pediatric HIV Infection, Immunological Reviews, 254, 1, pp. 143-169, (2013); Prendergast, Andrew J., The impact of differential antiviral immunity in children and adults, Nature Reviews Immunology, 12, 9, pp. 636-648, (2012)","","MDPI AG Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","14220067; 16616596","","","27490536","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982683359"

Previous measurements of the condensation rate were mainly based on the optical visualization. In the paper, the development of a new method that uses two ultrasonic frequencies for the measurement of the condensation rate in subcooled boiling is presented. The ultrasonic velocity profile (UVP) method is used for the velocity measurement. Two simultaneous UVP measurements by the two frequencies are exploited. The principle of the new condensation-rate-measurement method is established. In the method, the UVP data of the bubble surface velocity are used. In subcooled boiling, the bubble-surface velocity is affected by the condensation. The UVP measurement must capture correctly the condensation effect on the bubble-surface velocity. In order to confirm the applicability of the UVP method to the measurement of the surface velocity in this case, the growth rate of air bubbles from a nozzle submerged in water is measured and compared with the result of optical visualization and digital image processing. Such growth process is analogous to that of vapor bubbles in a boiling process, and it is the inverse of the condensation process. Evaluation of the new condensation-rate-measurement method is carried out by the measurements of adiabatic air-water-bubbly column and subcooled pool boiling in vertical round tube. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Condensation Rate; Heat Transfer; Mass Transfer; Optical Visualization; Subcooled Boiling; Ultrasonic Velocity Profile Measurement; Air; Heat Transfer; Image Processing; Inverse Problems; Mass Transfer; Optical Data Processing; Ultrasonic Velocity; Ultrasonic Velocity Measurement; Ultrasonic Waves; Velocity; Visualization; Condensation Effects; Condensation Process; Condensation Rates; Heat And Mass Transfer; Optical Visualization; Sub-cooled Boiling; Ultrasonic Frequency; Ultrasonic Velocity Profiles; Condensation","Air; Heat transfer; Image processing; Inverse problems; Mass transfer; Optical data processing; Ultrasonic velocity; Ultrasonic velocity measurement; Ultrasonic waves; Velocity; Visualization; Condensation effects; Condensation process; Condensation rates; Heat and mass transfer; Optical visualization; Sub-cooled boiling; Ultrasonic frequency; Ultrasonic velocity profiles; Condensation","","","The first author would like to express his sincere thanks to Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( JSPS ) for financial support, in the JSPS Ronpaku PhD Program, to carry out this study in the Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors, Tokyo Institute of Technology .

In this article, the detailed chemical kinetics for the thermal decomposition of LMW-MEs was investigated at atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of 773 to 973 K. Six standards of LMW-MEs were used for thermal decomposition in a continuous flow reactor. The kinetic data, such as reaction orders, activation energies, and rate constants, were then calculated. The reaction orders and activation energies of the thermal decomposition reactions of C<inf>4</inf>, C<inf>5</inf>, C<inf>6</inf>, C<inf>7</inf>, C<inf>8,</inf> and C<inf>9</inf> were 1.13, 0.96, 1.17, 0.80, 0.99, 0.84, and 312.04, 117.37, 87.29, 62.94, 74.80, 75.79 kJ mol−1, respectively.

Implementing concentration of surfactant through surfactant flooding is one of the big challenges while interfacial tension between surfactant solution and oil after certain concentration involves little changes such as critical micelle concentration (CMC). This article highlights the effect of nanosilica on CMC of Zyziphus Spina Christi, as sugar-based surfactant, in aqueous solutions for enhanced oil recovery and reservoir stimulation purposes. A conductivity approach was selected to assess the CMC of the introduced surfactant in aqueous solution at 25°C. The influence of nanosilica concentrations on CMC variation of introduced surfactant is considered. It is found that CMC of introduced surfactant decreased while the concentration of the nanosilica increased. Results from this study can aim in optimum condition selection of surfactant flooding as an enhanced oil recovery ends. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Critical Micelle Concentration; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Hydrophobic; Nanosilia; Sugar Based Surfactant; Abstracting; Critical Micelle Concentration; Floods; Micelles; Micellization; Oil Well Flooding; Petroleum Reservoir Engineering; Petroleum Reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); Solutions; Surface Active Agents; Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc); Enhanced Oil Recovery; Experimental Investigations; Hydrophobic; Micellization Behavior; Nanosilia; Reservoir Stimulations; Sugar-based Surfactants; Enhanced Recovery","Abstracting; Critical micelle concentration; Floods; Micelles; Micellization; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); Solutions; Surface active agents; Critical micelle concentration (cmc); Enhanced oil recovery; Experimental investigations; hydrophobic; Micellization behavior; nanosilia; Reservoir stimulations; Sugar-based surfactants; Enhanced recovery","","","","Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Adsorption of novel nonionic surfactant and particles mixture in carbonates: Enhanced oil recovery implication, Energy and Fuels, 26, 8, pp. 4655-4663, (2012); Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Experimental investigation of adsorption of a new nonionic surfactant on carbonate minerals, Fuel, 104, pp. 462-467, (2013); Dranchuk, P.

Consequently, methods of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) should be applied for more recovery from these reservoirs. In this study the ability of hydrophobic nanoparticles of sio<inf>2</inf> in EOR process through carbonate rock samples is studied. By employing hydrophobic nanosilica, we can lower interfacial tension between oil and nanofluid and then reduce the mobility ratio between oil and nanofluid in carbonate reservoirs; however, nanosilica can increase the viscosity of water exponentially. To evaluate this goal, core displacement experiment for carbonate core is conducted. These experiments are performed on the carbonate samples saturated with oil and brine that had got injected with nanosilica with six different concentrations. Investigating the outcomes shows that by rising nanoparticle concentration, the IFT between water and oil phases decreases and yields in decrease the mobility ratio between oil and nanofluid. For this, we measure the recovery level in different states of using 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, and 0 concentration of the nanoparticle. The outcomes achieved from our experiments reveals that employing hydrophobic nanosilica could increases the oil recovery factor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbonate Reservoir; Hydrophobic; Microemulsion; Nanoparticle; Oil Reovery; Carbonates; Carbonation; Hydrophobicity; Microemulsions; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Oil Well Flooding; Petroleum Reservoir Engineering; Petroleum Reservoirs; Secondary Recovery; Sedimentary Rocks; Carbonate Cores; Carbonate Reservoir; Displacement Experiments; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Hydrophobic Nanoparticles; Mobility Ratios; Nanoparticle Concentrations; Oil Recoveries; Enhanced Recovery","Carbonates; Carbonation; Hydrophobicity; Microemulsions; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Secondary recovery; Sedimentary rocks; Carbonate cores; Carbonate reservoir; Displacement experiments; Enhanced oil recovery; Hydrophobic nanoparticles; Mobility ratios; Nanoparticle concentrations; Oil recoveries; Enhanced recovery","","","","Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Adsorption of novel nonionic surfactant and particles mixture in carbonates: Enhanced oil recovery implication, Energy and Fuels, 26, 8, pp. 4655-4663, (2012); Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Nanofluid in Hydrophilic State for EOR Implication Through Carbonate Reservoir, Journal of Dispersion Science and Technology, 35, 11, pp. 1537-1542, (2014); Di, Qingfeng, Innovative drag reduction of flow in rock's micro-channels using nano particles adsorbing method, 2, pp. 1152-1162, (2010); Emerging Petroleum Oriented Nanotechnologies for Reservoir Engineering SPE 102060, (2009); A Study of Wettability and Permeability Change Caused by Adsorption of Nanometer Structured Polysilicon on the Surface of Porous Media SPE 77938, (2002); Ju, Binshan, Experimental study and mathematical model of nanoparticle transport in porous media, Powder Technology, 192, 2, pp. 195-202, (2009); China Particuol, (2006); Kanj, Mazen Yousef, Nanofluid coreflood experiments in the ARAB-D, (2009); Rodriguez, Elena, Enhanced migration of surface-treated nanoparticles in sedimentary rocks, SPE Annual Technical Conference Proceedings, 4, pp. 2058-2078, (2009); Singh, Subodh, Vital role of nanopolymers in drilling and stimulations fluid applications, SPE Annual Technical Conference Proceedings, 1, pp. 71-77, (2010)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","15322459; 10916466","","PSTEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978245701"

Metal ion adsorptions on Al-VN were strongly dependent on pH, with the optimum pH for adsorption of Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ solutions being 4, 5-7 and 5-6, respectively. The biosorption capacity of metal ions by Al-VN was independent of temperature. After one hour of contact time, the adsorption capacity reached equilibrium.

On this basis, the controlled synthesis of Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-SiO<inf>2</inf> core-shell nanoparticles and their surface functionalization with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPS) and 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) has been presented with a facile synthetic process. The as-prepared Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-SiO<inf>2</inf>-GPS-CDI core-multishell NPs can bind proteins. Therefore, recombinant protein A/G (pA/G) was efficiently coupled onto the surface of NPs via CDI groups, creating a complete coverage. Antibodies (αT IgG) were also conjugated on Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-SiO<inf>2</inf>-GPS-CDI-pA/G, i.e. 9 mg αT antibodies per 1 g NPs. After the surface functionalization of the magnetic nanoparticles, their superparamagnetism was reduced by a factor of about threefold in Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-SiO<inf>2</inf>, and fivefold in Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-SiO<inf>2</inf>-GPS-CDI-pA/G in comparison with that of the naked Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> NPs. The NPs conjugated with αT IgG could bind and remove 1 × 105 cells per 0.25 mg NPs in vitro. Finally, the new models of surface functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles have been proposed for promising bioconjugations in our further research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole; 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane; Core-shell Fe3o4-sio2 Nanoparticles; Fe3o4-sio2-gps-cdi-pa/g-αt; Protein Bsa; Antibodies; Core Shell Nanoparticles; Iron Oxides; Magnetite; Nanomagnetics; Recombinant Proteins; Shells (structures); Surface Measurement; Synthesis (chemical); 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane; Carbonyldiimidazole; Complete Coverages; Controlled Synthesis; Fe3o4 Nanoparticles; Magnetic Nano-particles; Sio2 Nanoparticles; Surface Functionalization; Silica Nanoparticles; 1,1' Carbonyldiimidazole; 3 Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane; Antibody Conjugate; Imidazole Derivative; Magnetic Nanoparticle; Magnetite Nanoparticle; Nanoconjugate; Polyclonal Antibody; Recombinant Protein; Silane Derivative; Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticle; Unclassified Drug; Article; Cell Separation; Comparative Study; Conjugation; Controlled Study; In Vitro Study; Infrared Spectroscopy; Magnetism; Nanofabrication; Particle Size; Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis; Priority Journal; Protein Binding; Room Temperature; Surface Property; Synthesis; T Lymphocyte; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction","Antibodies; Core shell nanoparticles; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Nanomagnetics; Recombinant proteins; Shells (structures); Surface measurement; Synthesis (chemical); 3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane; Carbonyldiimidazole; Complete coverages; Controlled synthesis; Fe3O4 nanoparticles; Magnetic nano-particles; SiO2 Nanoparticles; Surface Functionalization; Silica nanoparticles; 1,1' carbonyldiimidazole; 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane; antibody conjugate; imidazole derivative; magnetic nanoparticle; magnetite nanoparticle; nanoconjugate; polyclonal antibody; recombinant protein; silane derivative; superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; unclassified drug; Article; cell separation; comparative study; conjugation; controlled study; in vitro study; infrared spectroscopy; magnetism; nanofabrication; particle size; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein binding; room temperature; surface property; synthesis; T lymphocyte; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction","","","This work was supported by Vietnam National University , Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) under the Joint Research Project between VNUHCM (Vietnam)–JAIST (Japan) through the grant HS2014-18-02 .","Hermanson, Greg T., Bioconjugate Techniques, (2008); Laurent, Sophie, Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles: Synthesis, stabilization, vectorization, physicochemical characterizations and biological applications, Chemical Reviews, 108, 6, pp. 2064-2110, (2008); Ling, Daishun, Surface ligands in synthesis, modification, assembly and biomedical applications of nanoparticles, Nano Today, 9, 4, pp. 457-477, (2014); Yi, Dong Kee, Silica-coated nanocomposites of magnetic nanoparticles and quantum dots, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 127, 14, pp. 4990-4991, (2005); Morel, Anne Laure, Sonochemical approach to the synthesis of Fe3O4 @SiO2 core - Shell nanoparticles with tunable properties, ACS Nano, 2, 5, pp. 847-856, (2008); Hui, Chao, Core-shell Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles synthesized with well-dispersed hydrophilic Fe3O4 seeds, Nanoscale, 3, 2, pp. 701-705, (2011); Ma, Zhiya, Synthesis of magnetic silica nanospheres with metal ligands and application in affinity separation of proteins, Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects, 275, 1-3, pp. 87-91, (2006); Zhang, Guoqing, Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-modified magnetic microspheres for rapid affinity purification of lysozyme, Talanta, 83, 5, pp. 1515-1520, (2011); Chen, Hemei, Synthesis of Fe304@Si02@PMMA core-shell-shell magnetic microspheres for highly efficient enrichment of peptides and proteins for MALDI-ToF MS analysis, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 49, 3, pp. 607-611, (2010); Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces, (2011)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18734359; 09277757","","CPEAE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979879982"

The optimal values were found as 10.2 g reducing sugar (RS) per L, 37 °C and 5.0, which were subsequently applied in a CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) using suspended biomass at various hydraulic retention times (HRTs). Peak hydrogen production rate (HPR) values were 0.86 L H<inf>2</inf> per L per d and 0.15 L H<inf>2</inf> per L per d from batch and CSTR operations, respectively. Lowering HRT (at 24 h) resulted in the wash-out of microbial biomass. Pretreatment enlarged the pore size of the unhydrolyzed biomass (UHB) from 0.6 to 3.9 mm3 g-1. The structural characterization of the unhydrolyzed biomass (UHB) was assessed via SEM, XRD and FTIR and BET.

Their most important related compounds are also discussed for biomedical applications for treating various diseases, typically as cancers. At present, both physical and chemical methods have been proved very successful to synthesize, shape, control, and produce metal- and oxide-based homogeneous particle systems, e.g., nanoparticles and microparticles. Therefore, we have mainly focused on functional magnetic nanoparticles for nanomedicine because of their high bioadaptability to the organs inside human body. Here, bioconjugation techniques are very crucial to link nanoparticles with conventional drugs, nanodrugs, biomolecules or polymers for biomedical applications. Biofunctionalization of engineered nanoparticles for biomedicine is shown respective to in vitro and in vivo analysis protocols that typically include drug delivery, hyperthermia therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and recent outstanding progress in sweep imaging technique with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) MRI. The latter can be especially applied using magnetic nanoparticles, such as Co-, Fe-, Ni-based nanoparticles, α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> oxide nanoparticles for analysis and treatment of malignancies. Therefore, this review focuses on recent results of scientists, and related research on diagnosis and treatment methods of common and dangerous diseases by biomedical engineered nanoparticles. Importantly, nanosysems (nanoparticles) or microsystems (microparticles) or hybrid micronano systems are shortly introduced into nanomedicine. Here, Fe oxide nanoparticles ultimately enable potential and applicable technologies for tumor-targeted imaging and therapy. Finally, we have shown the latest aspects of the most important Fe-based particle systems, such as Fe, α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, Fe-FexOy oxide core-shell nanoparticles, and CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-MnFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> core-shell nanoparticles for nanomedicine in the efficient treatment of large tumors at low cost in near future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ag Nanoparticles; Au Nanoparticles; Cancer Therapy; Cancers; Drug; Drug Delivery; Fe Nanoparticles; Fe Oxide Nanoparticles; Hyperthermia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pt Nanoparticles; Tumors; Ferric Ion; Ferric Compounds; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Diagnosis; Diseases; Drug Delivery; Drug Therapy; Fourier Transforms; Functional Polymers; Gold; Hyperthermia Therapy; Imaging Techniques; Iron Compounds; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetism; Medical Applications; Medical Nanotechnology; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Nickel; Platinum; Precious Metals; Shells (structures); Silver; Synthesis (chemical); Tumors; Ag Nanoparticle; Au Nanoparticle; Cancer Therapy; Cancers; Drug; Fe Nanoparticles; Fe Oxide; Hyperthermia; Pt Nanoparticles; Nanomagnetics; Ferric Ion; Magnetite Nanoparticle; Drug Delivery System; Human; Magnetism; Medical Technology; Nanomedicine; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Thermotherapy; Biomedical Technology; Drug Delivery Systems; Ferric Compounds; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetics; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Nanomedicine","Diagnosis; Diseases; Drug delivery; Drug therapy; Fourier transforms; Functional polymers; Gold; Hyperthermia therapy; Imaging techniques; Iron compounds; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetism; Medical applications; Medical nanotechnology; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Nickel; Platinum; Precious metals; Shells (structures); Silver; Synthesis (chemical); Tumors; Ag nanoparticle; Au nanoparticle; Cancer therapy; Cancers; Drug; Fe nanoparticles; Fe oxide; Hyperthermia; Pt nanoparticles; Nanomagnetics; ferric ion; magnetite nanoparticle; drug delivery system; human; magnetism; medical technology; nanomedicine; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; thermotherapy; Biomedical Technology; Drug Delivery Systems; Ferric Compounds; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetics; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Nanomedicine","","ferric ion, 20074-52-6; Ferric Compounds; Magnetite Nanoparticles","We greatly thank and appreciate the financial supports and projects sponsored by Chinese Academy of Sciences (Visiting Fellowship for Researchers from Developing Countries, Grant No. 2013FFGB0007) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2014M551462) from Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other Universities for our research on Novel Magnetic Nanoparticles for Catalysis, Biology and Medicine (Nanomedicine).

The problem includes temporal evolution of three interfaces, i.e. solid-liquid, solid-gas, and liquid-gas, that are explicitly tracked under the assumption of axisymmetry. Method validation is carried out by comparing computational results with exact solutions for a two-dimensional Stefan problem, and with related experiments. We then use the method to investigate a drop solidifying on a cold plate in which there exists volume change due to density difference between the solid and liquid phases. Numerical results show that the shape of the solidified drop is profoundly different from the initial liquid one due to the effects of volume change and the tri-junction in terms of growth angles ϕ<inf>gr</inf> on the solidification process. A decrease in the density ratio of solid to liquid ρ<inf>sl</inf> or an increase in the growth angle results in an increase in the height of the solidified drop. The solidification process is also affected by the Stefan number St, the Bond number Bo, the Prandtl number Pr, the Weber number We, the ratios of the thermal properties of the solid to liquid phases k<inf>sl</inf> and C<inf>psl</inf>. Increasing St, Bo, Pr, We, or k<inf>sl</inf> decreases the solidified drop height and the time to complete solidification. Moreover, the solidification growth rate is strongly affected by St, k<inf>sl</inf> and C<inf>psl</inf>. An increase in any of these parameters hastens the growth rate of the solidification interface. Contrarily, increasing ρ<inf>sl</inf> decreases the growth rate. However, other parameters such as ϕ<inf>gr</inf>, Bo, Pr and We have minor effects on the solidification growth rate. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drop Solidification; Front-tracking; Three Phases; Triple Point; Volume Change; Drops; Growth Rate; Ionization Of Gases; Liquefied Gases; Liquids; Prandtl Number; Solidification; Computational Results; Front Tracking; Numerical Investigations; Solidification Interface; Solidification Process; Three Phasis; Triple Points; Volume Change; Phase Interfaces","Drops; Growth rate; Ionization of gases; Liquefied gases; Liquids; Prandtl number; Solidification; Computational results; Front tracking; Numerical investigations; Solidification interface; Solidification process; Three phasis; Triple points; Volume change; Phase interfaces","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant number 107.03-2014.21 .","Ajaev, Vladimir S., The effect of tri-junction conditions in droplet solidification, Journal of Crystal Growth, 264, 1-3, pp. 452-462, (2004); Al-Rawahi, Nabeel Z.H., Numerical simulation of dendritic solidification with convection: Two-dimensional geometry, Journal of Computational Physics, 180, 2, pp. 471-496, (2002); Anderson, Daniel M., The case for a dynamic contact angle in containerless solidification, Journal of Crystal Growth, 163, 3, pp. 329-338, (1996); Booth, Heather J., Recent applications of pulsed lasers in advanced materials processing, Thin Solid Films, 453-454, pp. 450-457, (2004); Conduction of Heat in Solids, (1959); Process for Producing Semiconductor Spheres, (1995); Enríquez, Oscar R., Freezing singularities in water drops, Physics of Fluids, 24, 9, (2012); Esmaeeli, Asghar, Computations of film boiling.

At a fixed pH, the NC adsorption increases with decreasing NaCl concentration, indicating that NC molecules mainly adsorb onto α-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> by electrostatic attraction.

Our recent research on 2D granular column collapses by using 2D granular materials (i.e., aluminum rods) has revealed results that differ markedly from those reported in the literature. We assume a 2D column with an initial height of h<inf>0</inf> and initial width of d<inf>0</inf>, a defined as their ratio (a=h<inf>0</inf>/d<inf>0</inf>), a final height of h<inf>∞</inf>, and maximum run-out distance of d<inf>∞</inf>. The experimental data suggest that for the low a regime (a≤0.65) the ratio of the final height to initial height is 1. However, for the high a regime (a≥0.65), the ratio of a to (d<inf>∞</inf>−d<inf>0</inf>)/d<inf>0</inf>, h<inf>0</inf>/h<inf>∞</inf>, or d<inf>∞</inf>/d<inf>0</inf> is expressed by power-law relations. In particular, the following power-function ratios (h<inf>0</inf>/h<inf>∞</inf>≈1.42a2/3 and d<inf>∞</inf>/d<inf>0</inf>∼4.30a0.72) are proposed for every a≥0.65. In contrast, the ratio (d<inf>∞</inf>−d<inf>0</inf>)/d<inf>0</inf>≈3.25a0.96 only holds for 0.65≤a≤1.5, whereas the ratio (d<inf>∞</inf>−d<inf>0</inf>)/d<inf>0</inf>≈3.80a0.73 holds for a≥1.5. In addition, the influence of ground contact surfaces (hard or soft beds) on the final run-out distance and destruction zone of the granular column under true 2D conditions is investigated. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d Granular Column Collapse; Failure Mechanism; Granular Flow; Run-out Distance; Confined Flow; Granular Materials; Outages; Experimental Investigations; Failure Mechanism; Granular Columns; Granular Flows; Horizontal Channels; Runout Distances; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Failure (mechanical)","Confined flow; Granular materials; Outages; Experimental investigations; Failure mechanism; Granular columns; Granular flows; Horizontal channels; Runout distances; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Failure (mechanical)","","","","Balmforth, Neil J., Granular collapse in two dimensions, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 538, pp. 399-428, (2005); Bui, Ha H., Smoothed particle hydrodynamics for soil mechanics, pp. 278-281, (2006); Lagrangian Mesh Free Particle Method Sph for Large Deformation and Post Failure of Geomaterial Using Elasto Plastic Constitutive Models, (2007); Bui, Ha H., Lagrangian meshfree particles method (SPH) for large deformation and failure flows of geomaterial using elastic-plastic soil constitutive model, International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics, 32, 12, pp. 1537-1570, (2008); Bui, Ha H., SPH-based numerical simulations for large deformation of geomaterial considering soil-structure interaction, 1, pp. 570-578, (2008); Bui, Ha H., Numerical simulation of granular materials based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), AIP Conference Proceedings, 1145, pp. 575-578, (2009); Bui, Ha H., A novel computational approach for large deformation and post-failure analyses of segmental retaining wall systems, International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics, 38, 13, pp. 1321-1340, (2014); Lajeunesse, Éric, Spreading of a granular mass on a horizontal plane, Physics of Fluids, 16, 7, pp. 2371-2381, (2004); Lajeunesse, Éric, Granular slumping on a horizontal surface, Physics of Fluids, 17, 10, (2005); Lube, Gert, Axisymmetric collapses of granular columns, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 508, pp. 175-199, (2004)","","Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan","","","","","","00219592","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931830190"

Throughout the study, we have observed that arsenite (As(III)) as well as arsenate (As(V)) could be removed with this system. In conventional water treatment technologies, the preoxidation of As(III) to As(V) by oxidizing chemical is a mandatory step for As(III) removal However, such a preoxidation unit has not been used in our BF pilot unit, and hence the mechanisms of As(III) removal by BF have been of interest. Using a flow-through column reactor that simulates the actual BF pond for analysis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we could observe the adsorption of As(III) in water onto iron hydroxides deposited on the biological filter. The time-resolved As K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were obtained when the water containing As(III) and Fe(II) was continuously fed to the reactor. An increase in the absorption intensity of the X-ray with time was clearly observed in the time-resolved spectra, indicating that the spectra represented the concentration and chemical state of As adsorbed at the solid-liquid interface of the biological filter. The XAS results also show that while the original water fed to the reactor was supposed to contain only As(III) and Fe(II), a small portion of As(III) was oxidized to As(V) in the influent line when the As(III) solution met the Fe(II) solution before flowing into the reactor. Consequently, besides As(III), As(V) probably formed by the oxidation of As(III) in the influent, was detected on the filter by XAS. The results demonstrate that, in BF, mechanisms of As(III) removal are at least partially explained by the adsorption of As(III) in the raw water to the biological filter as it is. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arsenic; Iron Oxide; Oxidation; Solid-liquid Interfaces; X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy; Arsenic; Filters (for Fluids); Groundwater; Interface States; Iron Oxides; Oxidation; Phase Interfaces; Water Absorption; X Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure Spectroscopy; X Ray Absorption Spectroscopy; Absorption Intensity; Biological Filters; Biological Filtration; Conventional Water Treatment; Oxidizing Chemicals; Solid-liquid Interfaces; Time-resolved Spectra; X-ray Absorption Near-edge Structure; Chemicals Removal (water Treatment)","Arsenic; Filters (for fluids); Groundwater; Interface states; Iron oxides; Oxidation; Phase interfaces; Water absorption; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Absorption intensity; Biological filters; Biological filtration; Conventional water treatment; Oxidizing chemicals; Solid-liquid interfaces; Time-resolved spectra; X-ray absorption near-edge structure; Chemicals removal (water treatment)","","","","Arsenic in Geosphere and Human Diseases, (2010); Amini, Manouchehr, Statistical modeling of global geogenic arsenic contamination in groundwater, Environmental Science and Technology, 42, 10, pp. 3669-3675, (2008); Smith, Allan H., Contamination of drinking-water by arsenic in Bangladesh: A public health emergency, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 78, 9, pp. 1093-1103, (2000); Yoshida, Takahiko, Chronic health effects in people exposed to arsenic via the drinking water: Dose-response relationships in review, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 198, 3, pp. 243-252, (2004); Islam, Farhana S., Role of metal-reducing bacteria in arsenic release from Bengal delta sediments, Nature, 430, 6995, pp. 68-71, (2004); McArthur, John M., Sedimentological, climatic, and tectonic, controls on arsenic pollution of groundwater, pp. 6-7, (2010); Nickson, Ross T., Arsenic poisoning of Bangladesh groundwater [7], Nature, 395, 6700, (1998); Nature, (1999); Nature, (1999); Cullen, William R., Arsenic Speciation in the Environment, Chemical Reviews, 89, 4, pp. 713-764, (1989)","","The Japan Society of Vacuum and Surface Science ejssnt@sssj.org","","","","","","13480391","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983287361"

Furthermore, while the most impact shall be achieved with large-scale use in the general building and structural sector, as replacement or supplement to OPC, the properties of these geopolymers may be optimized for special niche applications. One of these applications is for light weight, low thermal conductivity, heat resistant, and moderate strength cement binder for low rise residential buildings. In this study, compressive strength, heat resistance, volumetric weight, mass loss, water absorption and thermal conductivity of geopolymers formed from mixtures of coal bottom ash and rice hull ash (CBA-RHA) and coal fly ash and rice hull ash (CFA-RHA) with sodium silicate solution (modulus 2.5) as activator were evaluated. Using mixture design and the JMP statistical software, the CBA-RHA combination at a mass ratio of 46% CBA, 32% RHA with 22% WGS gave properties at maximum desirability of 17.6 MPa compressive strength, 1640 kg/m3 volumetric weight, 273 kg/m3 water absorption, 28 MPa compressive strength after high temperature exposure (1000oC for 2 hours) with 4.4% mass loss, and 0.578 W/m-K thermal conductivity. On a performance basis, even as the geopolymers are formed as paste, these properties fall within the standards for lightweight OPC based-concrete with strength requirements for residential buildings. The low thermal conductivity and higher strength after high temperature exposure vis-à-vis OPC are additional advantages for consideration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bottom Ash; Fly Ash; Geopolymers; Rice Hull Ash; Waste Utilization; Water Glass Activation","","","","","Guide to Thermal Properties of Concrete and Masonry Systems, (2025); Álvarez-Ayuso, Esther, Environmental, physical and structural characterisation of geopolymer matrixes synthesised from coal (co-)combustion fly ashes, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 154, 1-3, pp. 175-183, (2008); Standard Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units, (2014); J Mater Educ, (1994); Geopolymer 2002 Conference, (2002); Geopolymer Chemistry and Applications, (2008); Duxson, Peter, Geopolymer technology: The current state of the art, Journal of Materials Science, 42, 9, pp. 2917-2933, (2007); Juenger, Maria C.Garci, Advances in alternative cementitious binders, Cement and Concrete Research, 41, 12, pp. 1232-1243, (2011); Khale, Divya, Mechanism of geopolymerization and factors influencing its development: A review, Journal of Materials Science, 42, 3, pp. 729-746, (2007); Mellado-Romero, Ana María, Carbon footprint of geopolymeric mortar: Study of the contribution of the alkaline activating solution and assessment of an alternative route, RSC Advances, 4, 45, pp. 23846-23852, (2014)","","Gadjah Mada University aseanjournal@chemeng.ugm.ac.id","","","","","","16554418; 26555409","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964007980"

Here, new as-prepared CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles with sizes in the range of 5 μm show highly uniform characteristics in their size, shape and cubic spinel crystal structure according to X-ray diffraction (XRD), whole pattern fitting and Rietveld refinement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We discovered that the CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> microparticles prepared in the certain size range of 5 μm show exciting configurations of grain and grain boundaries under particle heat treatment at the high temperature 900°C. Finally, CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> ferrite particles with various well-defined micro and nanoscale structures were produced after appropriate heat treatment processes under high temperature, and which have a high coercive field, H<inf>C</inf>, around 416-888 Oe, and the highest saturation magnetization, M<inf>S</inf>, of about 74-91 emu g-1 at room temperature (RT) for all of the as-prepared samples measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Here, the magnetic behavior has shown persuasive evidence that the desirable ferrimagnetic properties of CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> oxides do not only depend on their size but also on the spinel structure of the CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> oxides as well. Finally, the as-prepared CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles with the formula CoO·Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> were regarded as the best inverse ferrimagnetic materials with magnetic parameters of H<inf>C</inf> at 896 Oe, M<inf>R</inf>/M<inf>S</inf> squareness around 0.420, and M<inf>S</inf> around 92 emu g-1 at 20 kOe for the downward part of the hysteresis loop. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alcohols; Cobalt Compounds; Crystal Structure; Ferrimagnetic Materials; Ferrimagnetism; Ferrite; Grain Boundaries; Heat Treatment; Magnetic Materials; Magnetism; Nanomagnetics; Nanotechnology; Rietveld Refinement; Saturation Magnetization; Scanning Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction; Cobalt Ferrite Particles; Ferrimagnetic Properties; Heat Treatment Process; High Coercive Field; Magnetic Parameters; Nanoscale Structure; Vibrating Sample Magnetometer; Whole-pattern Fitting; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy","Alcohols; Cobalt compounds; Crystal structure; Ferrimagnetic materials; Ferrimagnetism; Ferrite; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Magnetic materials; Magnetism; Nanomagnetics; Nanotechnology; Rietveld refinement; Saturation magnetization; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Cobalt ferrite particles; Ferrimagnetic properties; Heat treatment process; High coercive field; Magnetic parameters; Nanoscale structure; Vibrating sample magnetometer; Whole-pattern fitting; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","","","","Physics of Ferromagnetism 2e, (1997); Modern Ferrite Technology, (1990); J Magn Soc Jpn, (2015); Iron Oxides Structure Properties Reactions Occurrence and Uses, (1996); Physics of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, (2003); Coey, JMD Michael David, Magnetism and magnetic materials, 9780521816144, pp. 1-617, (2010); Springer Ser Mater Sci, (2012); Handbook of Advanced Magnetic Materials, (2006); Yuan, Changzhou, Mixed transition-metal oxides: Design, synthesis, and energy-related applications, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 53, 6, pp. 1488-1504, (2014); Abbas, Mohamed, Facile approach for synthesis of high moment Fe/ferrite and FeCo/ferrite core/shell nanostructures, Materials Letters, 139, pp. 161-164, (2015)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20462069","","RSCAC","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936803477"

Although physical inactivity lifestyle may cause many unexpected illnesses, it is complicated to build up a positive lifestyle due to the lacks of reminder systems to manage and monitor physical activities of people. This research represents an effective way for daily activity monitoring using accelerator and gyroscope sensors embedded in a smartphone. Signals were recorded from accelerator and gyroscope sensors while a user wearing the smartphone performs different activities (going downstairs, going upstairs, sitting with the phone in a pocket, driving and putting the phone on the table). The classification algorithms with k-nearestneighbor (kNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied to recognize user’s activities. The overall accuracy of recognizing five activities is 74% for kNN and 75.3% for ANN respectively. Based on the activities recognized during the day, users are able to manage their daily activities for a better life. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activity Monitoring; Activity Recognition; Smartphone; Biomedical Engineering; Gyroscopes; Neural Networks; Pattern Recognition; Signal Encoding; Telephone Sets; Activity Monitoring; Activity Recognition; Classification Algorithm; Daily Activity Monitoring; Human Activity Recognition; Intellectual Works; Nearest-neighbors; Overall Accuracies; Smartphones","Biomedical engineering; Gyroscopes; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Signal encoding; Telephone sets; Activity monitoring; Activity recognition; Classification algorithm; Daily activity monitoring; Human activity recognition; Intellectual works; Nearest-neighbors; Overall accuracies; Smartphones","","","","Global Health Risks Mortality and Burden of Disease Attributable to Selected Major Risks, (2009); Physical Activity and Health A Report of the Surgeon General, (1996); An, Qi, Evaluation of wearable gyroscope and accelerometer sensor (PocketIMU2) during walking and sit-to-stand motions, pp. 731-736, (2012); Lian, E., A novel electronic cervical range of motion measurement system, IFMBE Proceedings, 27, pp. 140-143, (2010); Brezmes, Tomas, Activity recognition from accelerometer data on a mobile phone, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5518 LNCS, PART 2, pp. 796-799, (2009); Cao, Yabo, E-FallD: A fall detection system using android-based smartphone, pp. 1509-1513, (2012); van Dantzig, Saskia, Toward a persuasive mobile application to reduce sedentary behavior, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 17, 6, pp. 1237-1246, (2013); undefined; Higuchi, Tomoyuki, Relationship between the fractal dimension and the power law index for a time series: A numerical investigation, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 46, 2, pp. 254-264, (1990); Higuchi, Tomoyuki, Approach to an irregular time series on the basis of the fractal theory, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 31, 2, pp. 277-283, (1988)","Toi, V.V.; Phuong, T.H.L.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY; GLOBAL Science and Technology; ITS Vietnam; NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS; SAIGON; SAIGON SCIENCTISTS; TRUNG SON T.S.S.E; U.S ARMY RDECOM; UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA; VIKOMED Advanced Medical Technology","5th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering, 2014","","Ho Chi Minh City","117119","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928256567"

In this study, set porous- CPC consisting of α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) beads and acidic calcium phosphate solution was developed and its basic setting reaction was studied. When α-TCP beads were exposed to the acidic calcium phosphate solution, brushite (CaHPO4 ·2H2O) was formed on the surface of the α-TCP beads. The formed brushite crystals interlocked with each other, resulting in a setting reaction of α-TCP microspheres within 10 min at 37°C. As a result of this setting reaction, a fullyinterconnected calcium phosphate macroporous structure was obtained. The set porous-CPC were immersed into simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37oC for different immersion time, The result clearly showed that brushite surface layer transformed to apatite layer after 3 days immersion into SBF solution by dissolution-precipitation reaction. Since apatite layer show excellent tissue response, the set porous-CPC would be a promising biomaterial used as artificial bone substitutes, and as the scaffold for tissue engineering. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Apatite; Brushite; Porous Cement; Setting Reaction; Α-tcp; Apatite; Biological Materials; Biomaterials; Biomedical Engineering; Bone; Bone Cement; Calcium; Cements; Phosphate Minerals; Scaffolds (biology); Setting; Tissue; Tissue Engineering; Brushite; Calcium Phosphate Cement; Dissolution Precipitations; Macroporous Structures; Setting Reactions; Simulated Body Fluids; Tri-calcium Phosphates; Tricalcium Phosphate Bead; Calcium Phosphate","Apatite; Biological materials; Biomaterials; Biomedical engineering; Bone; Bone cement; Calcium; Cements; Phosphate minerals; Scaffolds (biology); Setting; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Brushite; Calcium phosphate cement; Dissolution precipitations; Macroporous structures; Setting reactions; Simulated body fluids; Tri-calcium phosphates; Tricalcium phosphate bead; Calcium phosphate","","","","Yogyo Kyokai Shi, (1976); Cements Research Progress, (1986); Mirtchi, Amir A., Calcium phosphate cements: study of the β-tricalcium phosphate - monocalcium phosphate system, Biomaterials, 10, 7, pp. 475-480, (1989); Mirtchi, Amir A., Calcium phosphate cements: action of setting regulators on the properties of the β-tricalcium phosphate-monocalcium phosphate cements, Biomaterials, 10, 9, pp. 634-638, (1989); Burguera, Elena F., Injectable and rapid-setting calcium phosphate bone cement with dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part B Applied Biomaterials, 77, 1, pp. 126-134, (2006); Del Real, Rafael Pérez, A new method to produce macropores in calcium phosphate cements, Biomaterials, 23, 17, pp. 3673-3680, (2002); Trung Kien, Pham, Effect of phosphate solution on setting reaction of α-TCP spheres, Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society, 46, 2, pp. 63-67, (2010); Ishikawa, Kunio, Fully-interconnected pore forming calcium phosphate cement, Key Engineering Materials, 493-494, pp. 832-835, (2012); Kokubo, Tadashi, How useful is SBF in predicting in vivo bone bioactivity?, Biomaterials, 27, 15, pp. 2907-2915, (2006)","Toi, V.V.; Phuong, T.H.L.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY; GLOBAL Science and Technology; ITS Vietnam; NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS; SAIGON; SAIGON SCIENCTISTS; TRUNG SON T.S.S.E; U.S ARMY RDECOM; UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA; VIKOMED Advanced Medical Technology","5th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering, 2014","","Ho Chi Minh City","117119","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928234901"

Our experimental results suggest that flickering light can activate hemodynamic responses of the visual cortex but those changes are not significantly distinct among different stimulus conditions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomedical Engineering; Flickering; Hemodynamics; Near Infrared Spectroscopy; Vision; Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy; Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fnirs); Hemodynamic Response; Light Stimuli; Modulation Depth; Spatial Frequency; Visual Cortexes; Visual Tasks; Infrared Devices","Biomedical engineering; Flickering; Hemodynamics; Near infrared spectroscopy; Vision; Functional near infrared spectroscopy; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs); Hemodynamic response; Light stimuli; Modulation depth; Spatial frequency; Visual cortexes; Visual tasks; Infrared devices","","","","undefined; Garhöfer, Gerhard, Diffuse luminance flicker increases blood flow in major retinal arteries and veins, Vision Research, 44, 8, pp. 833-838, (2004); Yamasaki, Takao, Can we estimate the activating effects of visual channels in primary visual cortex by flicker VEPs?, International Congress Series, 1278, pp. 73-76, (2005); Miki, Atsushi, Near-infrared spectroscopy of the visual cortex in unilateral optic neuritis, American Journal of Ophthalmology, 139, 2, pp. 353-356, (2005); Taga, Gentaro, Hemodynamic responses to visual stimulation in occipital and frontal cortex of newborn infants: A near-infrared optical topography study, Pathophysiology, 10, 3-4, pp. 277-281, (2004); Liao, Steve Ming Che, Neonatal hemodynamic response to visual cortex activity: High-density near-infrared spectroscopy study, Journal of Biomedical Optics, 15, 2, (2010); van Toi, Vo, Visual stimulator, Review of Scientific Instruments, 49, 10, pp. 1403-1406, (1978); Allefeld, Carsten, Flicker-light induced visual phenomena: Frequency dependence and specificity of whole percepts and percept features, Consciousness and Cognition, 20, 4, pp. 1344-1362, (2011); Knapen, Tomas H.J., Stimulus flicker alters interocular grouping during binocular rivalry, Vision Research, 47, 1, pp. 1-7, (2007); Carmel, David, Conscious Awareness of Flicker in Humans Involves Frontal and Parietal Cortex, Current Biology, 16, 9, pp. 907-911, (2006)","Toi, V.V.; Phuong, T.H.L.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY; GLOBAL Science and Technology; ITS Vietnam; NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS; SAIGON; SAIGON SCIENCTISTS; TRUNG SON T.S.S.E; U.S ARMY RDECOM; UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA; VIKOMED Advanced Medical Technology","5th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering, 2014","","Ho Chi Minh City","117119","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928229219"

Impulse oscillometry system (IOS) is a non-volitional way to access the mechanical structure of the respiratory system. The goals of our study were to find out the sensitivity and specificity of the IOS in diagnosis of COPD patients, and investigate which IOS parameters are related to severity and airflow obstruction in Vietnamese COPD patients. The study contain twenty-two COPD patients (stage 3 and 4) and Thirty-four healthy people, whole of them are greater than 40 years, were recruited in Community Health Care Center, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. IOS measurements (R5, R20, X5, X20, AX, Fres and Delta R5-R20), and Spirometry (FEV1, FEV1/FVC) were performed. Pearson or Spearman correlation determined the relationships between IOS and Spirometry. Firstly, R5, X5, X20, AX, Fres & Delta R5-R20 were all significantly associated (p < 0.05) with FEV1. However, R20 were not related to FEV1. The strongest associations were observed between FEV1 and X5 (r = 0.7737), AX (r = -0.7825) and Delta R5-R20 (r = -0.7823). Secondly, X5, AX & Delta R5-R20 were significantly associated with FEV1/FVC. The strongest correlation was observed between Delta R5-R20 and FEV1/FVC with r = - 0.6903. Reactance airway measurements (X5, X20, AX, Fres), peripheral airway resistance (Delta R5-R20) and total respiratory resistance (R5) are closely related to Vietnamese COPD diagnosis than central respiratory resistance (R20).

In the critical synthetic and experimental conditions, large α-Fe2O3 particles exhibited homogeneously large sizes in the certain ranges of 1-5 μm and 1-10 μm, which are regarded as a discovery of controlled and shaped synthesis. The electrochemical measurements indicated that oxide powders containing as-prepared pure α-Fe2O3 microparticles were successfully used in the electrodes. Accordingly, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic cycling measurements indicated their potential applications for next-generation Fe-air battery technology in comparison with commercial oxide products of Fe2O3 particles.

Genes related to biomass degradation were mined for a better understanding of biomass digestion in the termite gut and to identify lignocellulolytic enzymes applicable to biofuel production. The sequencing generated 5.4Gb of useful reads, containing 125,431 ORFs spanning 78,271,365bp, 80% of which was derived from bacteria. The 12 most abundant bacterial orders were Spirochaetales, Lactobacillales, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonades, Synergistales, Desulfovibrionales, Xanthomonadales, Burkholderiales, Bacillales, and Actinomycetales, and 1460 species were estimated. Of more than 12,000 ORFs with predicted functions related to carbohydrate metabolism, 587 encoding hydrolytic enzymes for cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin were identified. Among them, 316 ORFs were related to cellulose degradation, and included β-glucosidases, 6-phospho-β-glucosidases, licheninases, glucan endo-1,3-β-. d-glucosidases, endoglucanases, cellulose 1,4-β-cellobiosidases, glucan 1,3-β-glucosidases, and cellobiose phosphorylases. In addition, 259 ORFs were related to hemicellulose degradation, encoding endo-1,4-β-xylanases, α-galactosidases, α-. N-arabinofuranosidases, xylan 1,4-β-xylosidases, arabinan endo-1,5-α-. l-arabinosidases, endo-1,4-β-mannanases, and α-glucuronidases. Twelve ORFs encoding pectinesterases and pectate lyases were also obtained. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of Illumina-based de novo sequencing for the analysis of a free-living bacterial community in the gut of a lower termite C.gestroi and for mining genes related to lignocellulose degradation from the gut bacteria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellulase;

The sharp polyhedral shapes and morphologies have been formed in the good assistance of NaBH<inf>4</inf> as versatile strong reducing agent. The sharp polyhedral and large Fe oxide microparticles exhibited a uniform characterization of size, shape and morphology with the pure α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> structure. To study durability and stability of the microparticles under temperature, we have rationally carried out isothermal heat treatment of the prepared α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> oxide microparticles at high annealing temperature about 500°C and 900-910°C for 1h. A new structure was found in the pure α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles with micro- and nano-structure co-existed with the very good formation of a three-dimensional (3D) structure with the oxide grains and the boundaries. The interesting phenomena of the deformation of surface, size, shape, and structure are discovered in α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> oxide microparticles by isothermal heat treatment. Apart from surface deformation, the new micro- and nano-structure of large α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> microparticles cannot be destroyed but they can be retained in their specific characteristics of size, shape, and morphology because of both plastic and elastic deformation co-existed. The interesting surface deformation by heat treatment is observed in comparison with the case without heat treatment. The typical magnetic properties of α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> microparticles were investigated in the appearance of grain and boundary. Finally, our proposal of the new technologies with particle heat treatment is very crucial to make novel micro- and nano-structures of ultra-high durability and stability with the grains and the boundaries that can be utilized in catalysis, energy and environment for future. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crystal Growth; Crystallization; Heat Treatment; Magnetic Materials; Microstructure; Surfaces; Iron Oxide; Oxide; Crystal Growth; Crystallization; Durability; Grain Boundaries; Isothermal Annealing; Isotherms; Magnetic Materials; Microstructure; Morphology; Nanostructures; Surfaces; Annealing Temperatures; Energy And Environment; Isothermal Heat Treatments; Micro-particles; Polyol Methods; Structural Formation; Surface Deformation; Three Dimensional (3d) Structures; Heat Treatment; Iron Oxide; Nanomaterial; Oxide; Polyol; Article; Heat Treatment; High Temperature; Particle Size; Priority Journal; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Temperature; Thermostability; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction","Crystal growth; Crystallization; Durability; Grain boundaries; Isothermal annealing; Isotherms; Magnetic materials; Microstructure; Morphology; Nanostructures; Surfaces; Annealing temperatures; Energy and environment; Isothermal heat treatments; Micro-particles; Polyol methods; Structural formation; Surface deformation; Three dimensional (3D) structures; Heat treatment; iron oxide; nanomaterial; oxide; polyol; article; heat treatment; high temperature; particle size; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; temperature; thermostability; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction","","iron oxide, 1332-37-2; oxide, 16833-27-5","This work is supported by NAFOSTED Grant No. 103.02-2014.45, 2014, Vietnam.

Blood samples were taken from 21 women with high TCDD (tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) levels from sprayed areas, 23 women with moderate TCDD levels from sprayed areas, and 19 women from non sprayed areas to determine their SCE frequency. The SCE frequencies for the high and moderate TCDD groups from the sprayed area and for the non sprayed area group were 2.40, 2.19, and 1.48 per cell, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that the standardized β values for 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexaCDD (β = 0.60), 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptaCDD (β = 0.64), and octaCDD (β = 0.65) were higher than those for TCDD (β = 0.34) and 1,2,3,7,8-pentaCDD (β = 0.42). The adjusted R2 value for polyCDDs (R2 = 0.38) was higher than that for polyCDD toxic equivalents (TEQ (toxic equivalents); R2 = 0.23). This study therefore shows that levels of hexa-, hepta-, and octaCDD, which were previously regarded as being less toxic than TCDD, are closely related to SCE frequency and that the level of dioxin (pg/g lipid) is potentially more useful as an indicator than TEQ value for explaining SCE frequency. © 2014 by the authors;

The polyhedral α-Fe <inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles were synthesized via a modified polyol method with the addition of an extra amount of NaBH<inf>4</inf> in ethylene glycol, and fabricated to a thick gas sensing film after calcination at 500°C and 900°C. The polyhedral α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles exhibited a p-type nature, which is a new result opposite to other results of recent reports of semiconductor gas sensors using α-Fe <inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>. In particular, we suggest that the difference between structure and morphology of α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles can lead to p-type and n-type characterization. In addition, we suggested that Na ions from NaBH<inf>4</inf> were incorporated into α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O <inf>3</inf> oxide. They are the cause of the generation of holes in α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> oxide that led to the p-type nature of α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> oxide. The measurement of the sensor response to hydrogen, carbon monoxide, toluene, propane and ethanol revealed that the sensor device synthesized using polyhedral α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O <inf>3</inf> particles is sensitive to hydrocarbons and ethanol. Importantly, the sensor device using polyhedral α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles calcined at 900°C was strongly sensitive to ethanol due to the porous structure of the α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gas Sensing Films; Gas Sensing Properties; Modified Polyol Method; Polyhedral Particles; Porous Structures; Semiconductor Gas Sensors; Sensor Response; Structure And Morphology; Alcohols; Calcination; Carbon Monoxide; Chemical Detection; Ethanol; Ethylene Glycol; Gas Detectors; Sensors; Gas Sensing Electrodes","Gas sensing films; Gas sensing properties; Modified polyol method; Polyhedral particles; Porous structures; Semiconductor gas sensors; Sensor response; Structure and morphology; Alcohols; Calcination; Carbon monoxide; Chemical detection; Ethanol; Ethylene glycol; Gas detectors; Sensors; Gas sensing electrodes","","","","Stannic Oxide Gas Sensor Principles and Applications, (1994); Moséley, Patrick T., Materials selection for semiconductor gas sensors, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 6, 1-3, pp. 149-156, (1992); Yamazoe, Noboru, Effects of additives on semiconductor gas sensors, Sensors and Actuators, 4, C, pp. 283-289, (1983); Sarala Devi, G., Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2-based powders and their gas-sensing properties, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 87, 1, pp. 122-129, (2002); Liao, Lei, Size dependence of gas sensitivity of ZnO nanorods, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 111, 5, pp. 1900-1903, (2007); Malchenko, S.

Due to the shear stress exerted by the tangential feed flow, the accumulation of the retained species in the membrane is reduced, and the nearly steady state operation can be attained. The determination of steady state permeate flux is significant in the design and optimization problem. Several mechanisms of transport phenomena have been proposed to estimate the steady state permeate flux such as concentration polarization and Brownian diffusion, shear-induced diffusion, inertial lift, and surface transport. Another approach is using dimensional analysis to give the correlation equation with the operating condition instead of a deep focus on mechanism. In this study, we apply the model proposed in our previous study to predict the steady state permeate flux from the experimental data. After that, a new method using dimensional analysis is also developed to predict the steady state permeate flux from the operating conditions such as the trans-membrane pressure, the feed flow rate, and the feed volume fraction in a wide range. The correlation equation provides a good estimation of the experimental results. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined Model; Cross-flow; Dimensional Analysis; Steady State Permeate Flux; Ultrafiltration; Optimization; Combined Model; Concentration Polarization; Cross Flows; Cross-flow Configuration; Cross-flow Ultrafiltration; Dimensional Analysis; Membrane Separation Process; Permeate Flux; Ultrafiltration","Optimization; Combined model; Concentration polarization; Cross flows; Cross-flow configuration; Cross-flow ultrafiltration; Dimensional analysis; Membrane separation process; Permeate flux; Ultrafiltration","","","","Belfort, Georges, The behavior of suspensions and macromolecular solutions in crossflow microfiltration, Journal of Membrane Science, 96, 1-2, pp. 1-58, (1994); Karasu, Kensuke, A model for cross-flow ultrafiltration of dairy whey based on the rheology of the compressible cake, Journal of Membrane Science, 341, 1-2, pp. 252-260, (2009); Yee, Kevin Wing Kan, A unified model of the time dependence of flux decline for the long-term ultrafiltration of whey, Journal of Membrane Science, 332, 1-2, pp. 69-80, (2009); Nguyen, Tuan Anh, A simple combination model for filtrate flux in cross-flow ultrafiltration of protein suspension, Journal of Membrane Science, 403-404, pp. 84-93, (2012); Davis, Robert H., Modeling of fouling of crossflow microfiltration membranes, Separation and Purification Reviews, 21, 2, pp. 75-126, (1992); Asaadi, M., A model for determining the steady state flux of inorganic microfiltration membranes, Chemical Engineering Journal, 48, 1, pp. 11-16, (1992); Elmaleh, Samuel, Dimensional analysis of steady state flux for microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes, Journal of Membrane Science, 139, 1, pp. 37-45, (1998); Ho, Chiachi, A combined pore blockage and cake filtration model for protein fouling during microfiltration, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 232, 2, pp. 389-399, (2000); Landman, Kerry Anne, Dewatering of flocculated suspensions by pressure filtration, Physics of fluids.

In the hydrothermal treatment, ammonia was used as a medium solution, and reaction temperature was varied from 120 to 180 °C to investigate the effect on crystal phase and morphology of the prepared samples. Prior to the hydrothermal treatment, graphene oxide was introduced into the medium solution as an impurity material. Graphene oxide was characterized using AFM to confirm the formation of single-layer graphene sheet and its image. Prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, N<inf>2</inf> adsorption (BET), Raman spectroscopy, FTIR and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra. Ammonia as a medium in hydrothermal reaction promoted the formation of nanoflakes and nanorods on the microspheres. Hydrothermal reaction temperature was found to have a significant effect on the morphology and crystal phase of the catalyst. Lower hydrothermal treatment temperature produced amorphous samples with higher surface area that increased methylene blue adsorption capacity significantly.

Here, we have compared the expression levels of a subset of GmNAC genes in drought-tolerant DT51 and drought-sensitive MTD720 under both normal and drought stress conditions aimed at identifying correlation between GmNAC expression levels and drought tolerance degree, as well as potential GmNAC candidates for genetic engineering. The expression of 23 selected dehydration-responsive GmNACs was assessed in both stressed and unstressed root tissues of DT51 and MTD720 using real-time quantitative PCR. The results indicated that expression of GmNACs was genotype-dependent. Seven and 13 of 23 tested GmNACs showed higher expression levels in roots of DT51 in comparison with MTD720 under normal and drought stress conditions, respectively, whereas none of them displayed lower transcript levels under any conditions. This finding suggests that the higher drought tolerance of DT51 might be positively correlated with the higher induction of the GmNAC genes during water deficit. The drought-inducible GmNAC011 needs to be mentioned as its transcript accumulation was more than 76-fold higher in drought-stressed DT51 roots relative to MTD720 roots. Additionally, among the GmNAC genes examined, GmNAC085, 092, 095, 101 and 109 were not only drought-inducible but also more highly up-regulated in DT51 roots than in that of MTD720 under both treatment conditions. These data together suggest that GmNAC011, 085, 092, 095, 101 and 109 might be promising candidates for improvement of drought tolerance in soybean by biotechnological approaches. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comparative Expression Analysis; Drought Stress; Nac Transcription Factor; Real-time Quantitative Pcr; Soybean; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors; Article; Controlled Study; Cultivar; Down Regulation; Drought Stress; Drought Tolerance; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; Genetic Engineering; Genotyping Technique; Gmnac Gene; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Physiological Process; Plant Growth; Plant Root; Promoter Region; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis; Soybean; Upregulation; Drought; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Genotype; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Plant Gene; Transcription Factor; Vegetable Protein; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genetic Engineering; Genotype; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Soybeans; Transcription Factors","article; controlled study; cultivar; down regulation; drought stress; drought tolerance; gene; gene expression; gene silencing; genetic engineering; genotyping technique; GmNAC gene; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogeny; physiological process; plant growth; plant root; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; soybean; upregulation; drought; gene expression regulation; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant gene; transcription factor; vegetable protein; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genetic Engineering; Genotype; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Soybeans; Transcription Factors","","Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors","","Nguyen, Thao Phuong, Potentials toward genetic engineering of drought-tolerant soybean, Critical Reviews in Biotechnology, 32, 4, pp. 349-362, (2012); Shinozaki, Kazuo Y., Gene networks involved in drought stress response and tolerance, Journal of Experimental Botany, 58, 2, pp. 221-227, (2007); Nishiyama, Rie, Arabidopsis AHP2, AHP3, and AHP5 histidine phosphotransfer proteins function as redundant negative regulators of drought stress response, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 12, pp. 4840-4845, (2013); Yang, Shujun, Narrowing down the targets: Towards successful genetic engineering of drought-tolerant crops, Molecular Plant, 3, 3, pp. 469-490, (2010); Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko, Transcriptional regulatory networks in cellular responses and tolerance to dehydration and cold stresses, Annual Review of Plant Biology, 57, pp. 781-803, (2006); Zhang, Gaiyun, Overexpression of the soybean GmERF3 gene, an AP2/ERF type transcription factor for increased tolerances to salt, drought, and diseases in transgenic tobacco, Journal of Experimental Botany, 60, 13, pp. 3781-3796, (2009); Lu, Guojun, Identification of OsbZIP72 as a positive regulator of ABA response and drought tolerance in rice, Planta, 229, 3, pp. 605-615, (2009); Abe, Hiroshi, Arabidopsis AtMYC2 (bHLH) and AtMYB2 (MYB) function as transcriptional activators in abscisic acid signaling, Plant Cell, 15, 1, pp. 63-78, (2003); Luo, Xiao, Expression of wild soybean WRKY20 in Arabidopsis enhances drought toleranc, Journal of Experimental Botany, 64, 8, pp. 2155-2169, (2013); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Isolation and functional analysis of arabidopsis stress-inducible NAC transcription factors that bind to a drought-responsive cis-element in the early responsive to dehydration stress 1 promoter, Plant Cell, 16, 9, pp. 2481-2498, (2004)","","","","","","","","14220067; 16616596","","","24322442","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84889817892"

AR showed advanced growth inhibition effects compared to antibiotics (amikacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and levofloxacin) frequently used for the treatment of infectious diseases, and worked synergistically with these antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of AR ranged from 13 to 20 mM. The bactericidal activity of AR was dose and time dependent.

The blending process of bio-kerosene which is a mixture of bio-jet paraffins and fossil kerosene is also displayed. The two prototypes of bio-paraffins (Bio-P1 and Bio-JP2), which were manufactured in Indonesia following the proposed production process, are used for making bio-kerosenes in current study. The theoretical and experimental investigations have been carried out to evaluate and identify the critical properties of bio-kerosenes: distillations, freezing point, lower heating value, density, flash point and viscosity to ensure ASTM criteria of jet fuel. The results show it can be blended directly 5% volume of Bio-P1 or 10% volume of Bio-JP2 to commercial Jet A-1 for powering aviation gas turbine engines without redesigning fuel system or fuel supply infrastructure. The use of these bio-paraffins not only reduces CO<inf>2</inf> lifecycle but also significantly decreases emissions of sulfur compounds (SO<inf>x</inf>).

Various herringbone-type carbons were used as additives to investigate the effects of carbon materials on the electrochemical properties of iron electrodes to find an adequate carbon for use in Fe-air battery anodes. An Fe/C composite electrode showed significant performance improvement over a pure iron electrode when herringbone carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were employed. The morphology of carbons as well as their characteristics strongly affected the cycling performance of the Fe/C composite electrodes. Our X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) study showed that during cycling, iron species were dispersed on the carbon surface.

The inhibitory activity of the H. acutigluma aqueous methanol extract on shoot growth of test plant was greater than P. pulchrum and I. hirtum while aqueous methanol extract of the P. pulchrum inhibited root growth greater than H. acutigluma and I. hirtum. The inhibitory efficacy of these emergent macrophytes was dependent on their potential activity, the test plant species and concentration of the extracts.

Moreover, the role of lateral (in) stability through bankvegetation effects on flowdynamics and bed morphology at a river confluence is not clearly understood.This paper presents an integrated depth-averaged 2D model to investigate these aspects. The computed results indicate that bed morphology at a large river confluence is substantially affected by flowrate rather than discharge/momentum ratio. Response of bed morphology to different flow stages has a periodic tendency depending upon flow rate. Additionally, the presence of vegetation over the confluence bar (if any) has significant influence on bed morphology within and downstream the river confluence. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2-d Model; Bed Morphology; Drainage Systems; Large Rivers; Numerical Investigations; River Confluence; Hydraulics; Sediment Transport; Stream Flow; Vegetation; Rivers","2-D model; Bed morphology; Drainage systems; Large rivers; Numerical investigations; River confluence; Hydraulics; Sediment transport; Stream flow; Vegetation; Rivers","","","","Biron, Pascale M., Bed morphology and sedimentology at the confluence of unequal depth channels, Geomorphology, 8, 2-3, pp. 115-129, (1993); Boyer, Claudine J., Dynamics of a river channel confluence with discordant beds: Flow turbulence, bed load sediment transport, and bed morphology, Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 111, 4, (2006); Hydraulic Research on Planimetric Forms Bed Topographies and Flow in Alluvial Rivers, (1984); Advances in Fluid Modeling and Turbulence Measurements, (2001); Kimura, Ichiro, URANS computations of shallow grid turbulence, Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 135, 2, pp. 118-131, (2009); Nezu, Iehisa, Turbulence in open-channel flows, (1993); Annual Journal of Hydraulic Engineering Japan Society of Civil Engineers, (2006); Rhoads, Bruce L., Response of bed morphology and bed material texture to hydrological conditions at an asymmetrical stream confluence, Geomorphology, 109, 3-4, pp. 161-173, (2009); Rice, Steve P., River Confluences, Tributaries and the Fluvial Network, pp. 1-456, (2008); Yamaguchi, Satomi, Weakly nonlinear analysis of dunes by the use of a sediment transport formula incorporating the pressure gradient, 2, pp. 813-820, (2006)","","","Colegio de Ingenieros Civiles de Costa Rica (CiC); Int.

The prediction of blistering is a challenging task and is of great significance in practice. In this paper, a model established for the prediction of blistering on a polymer-steel lining system is presented. The model is based on the concept that a blister occurs if its blistering energy exceeds the adhesion energy of the lined polymer. Several lining systems (polyethylene-steel and fluoropolymer-steel) were selected for evaluation of the model. Experimental data showed that the model can be applied to predict the osmotic blistering when a polymeric lining system works under an aqueous environment. © 2012 American Chemical Society. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adhesion Energy; Aqueous Environment; Experimental Data; Lining Systems; Forecasting; Linings; Polymers","Adhesion energy; Aqueous environment; Experimental data; Lining systems; Forecasting; Linings; Polymers","","","","Allen, Keith W., Strength and failure patterns of metal-metal adhesives, 2, pp. 38-45, (1972); Davis, R., BLISTER FORMATION IN RP: THE ORIGIN OF THE OSMOTIC PROCESS., (1983); Ghotra, Joginder Singh, OSMOSIS IN RESINS AND LAMINATES., pp. 63-95, (1984); Handbook of Polymer Fibre Composites, (1994); Corrosion, (1995); J Oil Colour Chem Assoc, (1987); Mechanics and Mechanisms of Delamination in A Poly Ether Sulfone Fiber, (1993); Kanninen, Melvin F., A dynamic analysis of unstable crack propagation and arrest in the DCB test specimen, International Journal of Fracture, 10, 3, pp. 415-430, (1974); Kinloch, A.

The large exposure of the Observatory allows the measurement of the main features of the energy spectrum with high statistics. Full Monte Carlo simulations of the extensive air showers (based on the CORSIKA code) and of the hybrid detector response are adopted here as an independent cross check of the standard analysis (Phys. Lett. B 685, 239 (2010)). The dependence on mass composition and other systematic uncertainties are discussed in detail and, in the full Monte Carlo approach, a region of confidence for flux measurements is defined when all the uncertainties are taken into account.

The results showed that the specific shapes of Pt NPs were influenced by the relevant factors, which are the contents of silver nitrate, synthetic time and temperature. A small content of silver nitrate has played an important role in determining their final shapes of platinum NPs. We observed that Pt NPs in the forms of very sharp shapes such as Pt cubes, octahedrons, cuboctahedrons and tetrahedrons have been obtained. In addition, the shape growth mechanisms and formation of Pt NPs have been studied. They exist in both cubic and octahedral shapes. Importantly, Pt nanocrystals can grow into main cubic and octahedral shapes for a short time less than 15 min. Moreover, Pt nanocrystals can also grow into different shapes from cubic and octahedral into spherical ones for several hours. Especially, they exhibited interesting shapes of multiple-branched Pt nanostructures because of their overgrowth and aggregations. Clearly, large cubic and octahedral Pt NPs of 160 nm diameter were observed. The growth and formation of large cubic and octahedral Pt NPs were due to the aggregation of Pt clusters or initial Pt seeds, even small Pt nanocrystals. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Polyol Method; Pt Nano-octahedron; Pt Nanocube; Pt Nanoparticles; Ethylene Glycol; Povidone; Silver Nitrate; Different Shapes; Formation Mechanism; Growth Mechanisms; Modified Polyol Method; Nano-octahedron; Nanocubes; Octahedral Morphology; Platinum Nanoparticles; Poly(vinyl Pyrrolidone); Polyol Methods; Pt Clusters; Pt Nanoparticles; Silver Nitrates; Synthetic-time; Agglomeration; Alcohols; Ethylene Glycol; Nanocrystals; Nanoparticles; Platinum; Silver Alloys; Platinum Compounds; Ethylene Glycol; Nanocrystal; Platinum Nanoparticle; Povidone; Silver Nitrate; Article; Micromorphology; Molecular Mechanics; Molecular Stability; Nanofabrication; Particle Size; Priority Journal; Temperature","Different shapes; Formation mechanism; Growth mechanisms; Modified polyol method; Nano-octahedron; Nanocubes; Octahedral morphology; Platinum nanoparticles; Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone); Polyol methods; Pt clusters; Pt nanoparticles; Silver nitrates; Synthetic-time; Agglomeration; Alcohols; Ethylene glycol; Nanocrystals; Nanoparticles; Platinum; Silver alloys; Platinum compounds; ethylene glycol; nanocrystal; platinum nanoparticle; povidone; silver nitrate; article; micromorphology; molecular mechanics; molecular stability; nanofabrication; particle size; priority journal; temperature","","ethylene glycol, 107-21-1; povidone, 9003-39-8; silver nitrate, 7761-88-8","This work was supported by NAFOSTED Grant No. 104.03-2011.33, 2011.

The bacteria produce high molecular weight amylase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram activity staining showed a single band at around 150 kDa. The enzyme was purified by disc preparative native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ion chromatograph analysis of reaction products of P. ethanolidurans amylase on starch showed that glucose and maltose are the main final products. The appearance of maltose and glucose as major hydrolysis products suggests that the amylase produced by this organism is of α-type. Optimal temperature and pH for the enzyme activity were 60°C and pH 4.0 - 6.0, respectively. Enzyme activity was not affected by the presence of 10 mM calcium chloride (Ca2+) or the presence of 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl.

TEM and HRTEM images of Pt nanoparticles show the particle size in the 10 nm range for the well-controlled case. In contrast, Pt nanoparticles have the particle size in the 50 nm range for the uncontrolled case. To understand the important issues of morphology, size, surface and structure, the as-prepared Pt nanoparticles were investigated through UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution (HR)TEM measurements. In the two cases, the as-prepared Pt nanoparticles with and without the control procedures exhibit surface attachment, aggregation or agglomeration and assembly. The mechanisms can lead to the formation of the ultra-porous mesostructure of the as-prepared Pt nanoparticles by using various sophisticated control methods. Therefore, the experimental findings and observations showed the formations of the porous Pt nanostructures as the new Pt textures from self-aggregation or self-agglomeration and self-assembly of extreme importance in designing great superlattices under experimentally chemical and physical methods. This also proved the important role of PVP polymer in the protection of the as-prepared nanoparticles. In particular, a new phenomenon was found in the randomly natural collapse and self-breaking in the Pt nanostructures originating from the naked Pt nanoparticles without protective polymer agents. As a result, a porous meso-nanostructure was formed by the structural changes of Pt nanoparticles without stabilization of the PVP polymer. Finally, the discoveries of surface structure changes of polyhedral Pt shapes and morphologies in future are very important in further catalysis investigation. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Povidone; Silver Nitrate; Platinum Nanoparticle; Polyol; Povidone; Silver Nitrate; Article; Catalysis; Chemical Engineering; Chemical Structure; Molecular Dynamics; Morphology; Particle Size; Priority Journal; Structure Analysis; Surface Property; Synthesis; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Ultraviolet Spectroscopy; X Ray Diffraction","platinum nanoparticle; polyol; povidone; silver nitrate; article; catalysis; chemical engineering; chemical structure; molecular dynamics; morphology; particle size; priority journal; structure analysis; surface property; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet spectroscopy; X ray diffraction","","povidone, 9003-39-8; silver nitrate, 7761-88-8","","Burda, Clemens, Chemistry and properties of nanocrystals of different shapes, Chemical Reviews, 105, 4, pp. 1025-1102, (2005); Narayanan, Radha, Catalysis with transition metal nanoparticles in colloidal solution: Nanoparticle shape dependence and stability, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 109, 26, pp. 12663-12676, (2005); Metal Nanoparticles in Catalysis, (2004); Parak, Wolfgang Johann, Materials science: Complex colloidal assembly, Science, 334, 6061, pp. 1359-1360, (2011); Barnard, Amanda S., Morphology mapping of platinum catalysts over the entire nanoscale, Catalysis Science and Technology, 1, 8, pp. 1440-1448, (2011); Wang, Yuan, Preparation of tractable platinum, rhodium, and ruthenium nanoclusters with small particle size in organic media, Chemistry of Materials, 12, 6, pp. 1622-1627, (2000); Adv Funct Mater, (2011); Tao, Andrea R., Shape control of colloidal metal nanocrystals, Small, 4, 3, pp. 310-325, (2008); Science, (2007); Antolini, Ermete, The renaissance of unsupported nanostructured catalysts for low-temperature fuel cells: From the size to the shape of metal nanostructures, Journal of Materials Science, 46, 13, pp. 4435-4457, (2011)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","13699261; 11440546","","NJCHE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865659149"

Structural analyses indicated that the PS was considered to be a kind of sulfated rhamnoglucan-containing uronic acid at a composition of 23 mol% and that the total composition of anionic groups such as sulfate and carboxylate was 31 mol% to the monosaccharide residues. Since the PS was found to be a huge macromolecule with an ultra-high molecular weight (3.14×10 7 g/mol), the simple calculation indicated that about 9.5×10 4 anions exist on one chain of the PS. The electric conductivity of the highly anionic PS solutions indicated that the metal ions such as Ga 3+, La 3+, and Ca 2+ complexed ionically with PS chains. The PS formed the gels as a result of trivalent metal complexation, but the gelation behavior of the PS was different from that of the representative metal-complexable polysaccharide, alginate, in terms of the minimum gel formation concentration and the average molecular weight between crosslinking points. © Springer-Verlag 2011. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyanobacteria; Gel Beads; Metal Binding Property; Polysaccharides; Calcium; Gallium; Polysaccharide Sulfate; Anionic Groups; Anionic Polysaccharides; Average Molecular Weight; Cyanobacteria; Environmental Water; Gel Beads; Gel Formation; Gelation Behavior; Metal Binding Property; Metal Complexation; One Chain; Sulfated Polysaccharides; Trivalent Metal Ions; Ultra-high Molecular Weight; Uronic Acids; Binding Energy; Biological Materials; Carboxylation; Carboxylic Acids; Coagulation; Crosslinking; Electric Conductivity; Gallium; Gelation; Gels; Glucose; Metal Ions; Metals; Molecular Weight; Polysaccharides; Alginate; Calcium; Gallium; Lanthanide; Metal Complex; Polysaccharide Sulfate; Aphanothece Stagnina; Article; Complex Formation; Concentration (parameters); Conductance; Controlled Study; Cross Linking; Cyanobacterium; Extraction; Gel; Gel Swelling; Gelation; Macromolecule; Metal Mediated Gelation; Molecular Weight; Ph; Physical Phenomena; Priority Journal; Structure Analysis; Young Modulus","Anionic groups; Anionic polysaccharides; Average molecular weight; Cyanobacteria; Environmental water; Gel beads; Gel formation; Gelation behavior; Metal binding property; Metal complexation; One chain; Sulfated polysaccharides; Trivalent metal ions; Ultra-high molecular weight; Uronic acids; Binding energy; Biological materials; Carboxylation; Carboxylic acids; Coagulation; Crosslinking; Electric conductivity; Gallium; Gelation; Gels; Glucose; Metal ions; Metals; Molecular weight; Polysaccharides; Alginate; calcium; gallium; lanthanide; metal complex; polysaccharide sulfate; Aphanothece stagnina; article; complex formation; concentration (parameters); conductance; controlled study; cross linking; cyanobacterium; extraction; gel; gel swelling; gelation; macromolecule; metal mediated gelation; molecular weight; pH; physical phenomena; priority journal; structure analysis; Young modulus","","calcium, 14092-94-5, 7440-70-2; gallium, 14391-02-7, 7440-55-3; polysaccharide sulfate, 79933-28-1","","Kjellén, Lena, Cell-surface heparan sulfate: An intercalated membrane proteoglycan, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 78, 9 II, pp. 5371-5375, (1981); Heyn, Anton N.J., Molecular basis of auxin-regulated extension growth and role of dextranase, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 78, 11 II, pp. 6608-6612, (1981); Nishinari, Katsuyoshi, Rheological and DSC study of sol-gel transition in aqueous dispersions of industrially important polymers and colloids, Colloid and Polymer Science, 275, 12, pp. 1093-1107, (1997); Watase, Mineo, The rheological study of the interaction between alkali metal ions and kappa-carrageenan gels, Colloid and Polymer Science, 260, 10, pp. 971-975, (1982); Lee, KuenYong, Hydrogels for tissue engineering, Chemical Reviews, 101, 7, pp. 1869-1879, (2001); Pereira, Sara Bernardes, Complexity of cyanobacterial exopolysaccharides: Composition, structures, inducing factors and putative genes involved in their biosynthesis and assembly, FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 33, 5, pp. 917-941, (2009); Bertocchi, Claudia, Polysaccharides from cyanobacteria, Carbohydrate Polymers, 12, 2, pp. 127-153, (1990); Okajima, Maiko Kaneko, Gelation behavior by the lanthanoid adsorption of the cyanobacterial extracellular polysaccharide, Biomacromolecules, 11, 11, pp. 3172-3177, (2010); Hori, Kohji, Absorption of color additives and settling volume in water of blue-green alga, ishikurage (Nostoc commune), Plant Foods for Human Nutrition, 42, 1, pp. 31-36, (1992); Harkema, Jack R., Ozone- and endotoxin-induced mucous cell metaplasias in rat airway epithelium: Novel animal models to study toxicant-induced epithelial transformation in airways, Toxicology Letters, 68, 1-2, pp. 251-263, (1993)","","","","","","","","0303402X; 14351536","","CPMSB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857639306"

In addition to searching for clues on lee-face sorting, another purpose is to provide benchmark data for small-scale ""qDNS"" of bedload sediment transport. While sorting of fines in a rotating tumbler, and other canonical grain flows, has been studied in air, there is a dearth of corresponding studies in liquid.

These nanoparticles consist of Pt and Pt-Pd core-shell nanocatalysts exhibiting polyhedral morphologies. The controlled syntheses of Pt metallic nanoparticles in the 10-nm regime (4-8 nm) and Pt-Pd bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles in the 30-nm regime (15-25 nm) are presented. To realize our ultimate research goals for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), we thoroughly investigate the dependence of the electrocatalytic properties of the nanoparticles on the structure, size and morphology. Significant differences in the electrocatalysis are also explained in experimental evidences of both Pt and Pt-Pd nanocatalysts. We suggested that the core-shell controlled morphologies and nanostructures of the Pd nanoshell as the Pd atomic monolayers will not only play an important role in producing inexpensive, novel Pt- and Pd-based nanocatalysts but also in designing more efficient Pt- and Pd-based nanocatalysts for practical use in DMFC technology. Our comparative results show that Pt-Pd nanocatalysts with Pd nanoshells exhibited much better electrocatalytic activity and stabilization compared to Pt nanocatalysts. Interestingly, we found that the size effect is not as strong as the nanostructuring effect on the catalytic properties of the researched nanoparticles.

The structures and properties of the surfaces of Pt nanoparticles were investigated through cyclic voltammetry in dilute perchloric acid (HClO<inf>4</inf>) electrolyte solution. A comparison of the electrocatalytic property in methanol electrooxidation was made. Here, the effects of polyhedral and non-polyhedral morphologies on their catalytic properties were studied. The results revealed that the special catalytic activity of quasi-sphere non-polyhedral Pt nanoparticles is higher than that of polyhedral Pt nanoparticles. In addition, Pt nanoparticles of un-sharp and quasi-sphere morphologies exhibit the tolerance to poisoning species better than that of Pt nanoparticles of sharp and polyhedral morphologies due to the various morphologies of the catalyst surfaces in the chronoamperometric plots.

Muconaldehyde was not produced from phenol, indicating that muconaldehyde and phenol are produced as initial stable intermediates by independent pathways. The amount of muconaldehyde produced in the reaction solution was low because it was rapidly oxidized on the photocatalyst. The contributions of the two pathways to the mineralization of benzene were analyzed by isotopic tracing methods using labeled benzene (13C<inf>6</inf>H<inf>6</inf>) and labeled phenol (13C<inf>6</inf>H<inf>5</inf>OH). The results showed that a larger part (60-70%) of benzene is initially converted to muconaldehyde. The percentage was dependent on the properties of TiO<inf>2</inf> powders.

An initial glucose concentration of 200gL-1 was used to produce yeast cells under batch operating mode. After a period of 18-20h, a medium of 350gL-1 glucose concentration was fed continuously to the fermentation-separation column. During the continuous experiments, fermented broth was recirculated back to the fermentation-separation column. At atmospheric pressure, the dry mass concentration decreased rapidly and remained at 2.4gL-1 after long period, while glucose concentration still remained at 240gL-1. On the other hand, at vacuum pressure, a quasi-steady state condition was reached after 96h, corresponding to 4.2gL-1 of cell dry mass, 165gL-1 of glucose and 44.2gL-1 of ethanol levels in the fermentation broth and 33.2wt% of ethanol concentration at the outlet.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution (HR) TEM measurements were used to investigate their characterization. In the case of the previous removal of PVP by washing and heating at 300°C, the specific morphologies of polyhedral Pt nanoparticles were still observed. However, the removal of PVP only by heat treatment at 300°C without washing causes the significant variation of their morphology. The large Pt particles were observed in the self-aggregation and assembly of the as-prepared polyhedral Pt nanoparticles. The pure Pt nanoparticles by washing and heat treatment showed the electrocatalytic property better than PVP-Pt nanoparticles by heat treatment due to the incomplete removal of PVP and by-products from AgNO<inf>3</inf>.

It is most impressive to find that the arrangement of Pt nanoparticles was observed in their surface attachments, self-aggregation, random and directed surface self-assembly by the bottom-up approach.

This arises primarily due to the inability of β-lactam antibiotics to inhibit the transpeptidase activity of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). Effective inhibition of PBP2a to prevent the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis is of great importance for the treatment of a variety of clinically challenging infectious diseases caused by MRSA. To gain fundamental insights into the mode of covalent inhibition of the enzyme, we have carried out computational studies of the acylation reactions between small β-lactam molecules (methicilin and nitrocefin) and PBP2a using the B3LYP/6-31G* and ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31G:AMBER) hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical methods. Our calculations show that the acylation involves two transition states and that methicilin and nitrocefin undergo acylation in slightly different manners. The acylation of nitrocefin is more facile, which is attributed to the larger release of ring strain and the larger resonance stabilization gained upon ring opening. We suggest that, in addition to the nonbonded interactions between the ligand and the protein, these quantum chemical factors, which are associated with efficiency of the acylation step, should be taken into account and carefully controlled in designing novel β-lactam inhibitors of PBP2a. © 2011 American Chemical Society. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Meticillin; Nitrocefin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Cephalosporins; Methicillin; Penicillin-binding Proteins; Nitrocefin; Acylation; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biochemistry; Cell Membranes; Diseases; Health Risks; Molecular Modeling; Quantum Chemistry; Quantum Theory; Bacterial Resistance; Computational Studies; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Nonbonded Interaction; Pathogenic Bacterium; Penicillin- Binding Proteins; Quantum Mechanical/molecular Mechanical; Resonance Stabilization; Enzyme Inhibition; Antiinfective Agent; Cephalosporin Derivative; Meticillin; Nitrocefin; Penicillin Binding Protein; Acylation; Article; Chemical Structure; Chemistry; Drug Antagonism; Drug Effect; Enzyme Active Site; Enzymology; Metabolism; Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Penicillin Resistance; Thermodynamics; Anti-bacterial Agents; Catalytic Domain; Cephalosporins; Methicillin; Methicillin Resistance; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Models, Molecular; Penicillin-binding Proteins; Thermodynamics","Acylation; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biochemistry; Cell membranes; Diseases; Health risks; Molecular modeling; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Bacterial resistance; Computational studies; Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; Nonbonded interaction; Pathogenic bacterium; Penicillin- binding proteins; Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical; Resonance stabilization; Enzyme inhibition; antiinfective agent; cephalosporin derivative; meticillin; nitrocefin; penicillin binding protein; acylation; article; chemical structure; chemistry; drug antagonism; drug effect; enzyme active site; enzymology; metabolism; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; penicillin resistance; thermodynamics; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Catalytic Domain; Cephalosporins; Methicillin; Methicillin Resistance; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Models, Molecular; Penicillin-Binding Proteins; Thermodynamics","","meticillin, 132-92-3, 38882-79-0, 61-32-5; nitrocefin, 41906-86-9; Anti-Bacterial Agents, 0; Cephalosporins, 0; Methicillin, 61-32-5; Penicillin-Binding Proteins, 0; nitrocefin, 41906-86-9","","Wertheim, Heiman F.L., The role of nasal carriage in Staphylococcus aureus infections, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 5, 12, pp. 751-762, (2005); Frank, Daniel N., The human nasal microbiota and Staphylococcus aureus, PLOS ONE, 5, 5, (2010); Jevons, M.

Phenol was produced as a main intermediate in solution. When anatase powders, which showed high activity for oxidation of benzene, were used, 70-90% of oxygen introduced into phenol was from water. On the other hand, when rutile powders were used, only 20-40% of the oxygen was from water. The rest was from molecular oxygen in both cases. The rate of phenol production by using molecular oxygen was nearly the same between anatase and rutile powders.

The modified polyol method by adding silver nitrate and varying the molar ratio of the solutions of silver nitrate and H<inf>2</inf>PtCl<inf>6</inf> has been used to produce Pt nanoparticles of the size and shape to be controlled. The size and morphology of Pt nanoparticles have been studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). The results have shown that their very sharp and good shapes exist in the main forms of cubic, cuboctahedral, octahedral and tetrahedral shapes directly related to the crystal nucleation along various directions of the {100} cubic, {111} octahedral and {111} tetrahedral facets during synthesis. In particular, various irregular and new shapes of Pt nanoparticles have been found.

In the technique, the metal lines are formed in trenches by using functional liquids containing metal nanoparticles. The trenches are constructed on a plastic substrate by imprint of a patterned mold. When the whole surface of the plastic substrate is covered with a hydrophobic film, the hydrophobic property disappears only in the trenches due to the pressing process of the imprint, and thus the functional liquid automatically accumulates into the trenches. When the metallic functional liquid is modified with tween-20 (polyoxyethylene-20), metal lines with a width of 10 μm are formed by capillary effect.

We hypothesize that interference with cell adhesion might be one mechanism. Methods: The effect of EGCG on cell adhesion and proliferation was examined using pancreatic cancer cells. Results: EGCG-treated pancreatic cancer cells AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 decrease cell adhesion ability on micro-pattern dots, accompanied by dephosphorylations of both focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), whereas retained the activations of mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin. The growth of AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, when cultured at low density, can be significantly suppressed by EGCG treatment alone in a dose-dependent manner. At a dose of 100 μM that completely abolishes activations of FAK and IGF-1R, EGCG suppresses more than 50% of cell proliferation without evidence of apoptosis analyzed by PARP cleavage. Finally, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 enhances growth-suppressive effect of EGCG. Conclusions: Blocking FAK and IGF-1R by EGCG could prove valuable for targeted therapy, which can use in combination with other therapies, for pancreatic cancer. © Springer-Verlag 2010. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Egcg; Fak; Igf-1r; N-cadherin; Pancreatic Carcinoma; Biomedical Engineering; Cell Adhesion; Cell Death; Cell Proliferation; Chemical Activation; Diseases; Enzymes; Mammals; Egcg; Focal Adhesion Kinase; Growth-suppressive Effects; Igf-1r; Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptors; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase; N-cadherin; Pancreatic Carcinoma; Tea","Biomedical engineering; Cell adhesion; Cell death; Cell proliferation; Chemical activation; Diseases; Enzymes; Mammals; EGCG; Focal adhesion kinase; Growth-suppressive effects; IGF-1R; Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors; Mitogen activated protein kinase; N-cadherin; Pancreatic carcinoma; Tea","","","","Hecker, Timothy P., Focal adhesion kinase in cancer, Frontiers in Bioscience - Landmark, 8, SUPPL., pp. s705-s714, (2003); Golubovskaya, Vita M., Simultaneous inhibition of focal adhesion kinase and Src enhances detachment and apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines, Molecular Cancer Research, 1, 10, pp. 755-764, (2003); Liu, Weiguo, FAK and IGF-IR interact to provide survival signals in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, Carcinogenesis, 29, 6, pp. 1096-1107, (2008); Bauer, Todd W., Regulatory role of c-Met in insulin-like growth factor-I receptor - Mediated migration and invasion of human pancreatic carcinoma cells, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, 5, 7, pp. 1676-1682, (2006); Hakam, Ardeshir, Coexpression of IGF-1R and c-Src Proteins in Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Digestive Diseases and Sciences, 48, 10, pp. 1972-1978, (2003); Vu, Hoang Anh, FLT3 is fused to ETV6 in a myeloproliferative disorder with hypereosinophilia and a t(12;13)(p13;q12) translocation, Leukemia, 20, 8, pp. 1414-1421, (2006); Inaba, Hiroyuki, Comparative examination of anti-proliferative activities of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epigallocatechin against HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 31, 1, pp. 79-84, (2008); Pyrzyńska, Beata, Tumor suppressor p53 mediates apoptotic cell death triggered by cyclosporin A, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277, 16, pp. 14102-14108, (2002); Shintani, Yashushi, Collagen I promotes metastasis in pancreatic cancer by activating c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 and up-regulating N-cadherin expression, Cancer Research, 66, 24, pp. 11745-11753, (2006); Rieger-Christ, Kimberly M., The green tea compound, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate downregulates N-cadherin and suppresses migration of bladder carcinoma cells, Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, 102, 2, pp. 377-388, (2007)","","Springer Verlag","","3rd International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering in Vietnam","","Ho Chi Minh City","81635","16800737; 14339277","9783032043719; 9783642039034; 9783030318659; 9783031422423; 9783642293047; 9783319122618; 9783031901966; 9783642130380; 9783031821226; 9783031469329","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952378687"

Changes in SDO composition during storage took place more rapidly than in cold-pressed oil. Total monoterpene hydrocarbons decreased markedly, with major losses of limonene and γ-terpinene and notable increases in p-cymene, as well as alcohols. Bicyclogermacrene, the main sesquiterpene hydrocarbon of the fresh oil, practically disappeared. (-)-Spathulenol, the main artifact, was converted from bicyclogermacrene. Antioxidants such as α-tocopherol, β-carotene and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene (BHT) slowed the formation of oxidation products, such as p-cymene, (-)-spathulenol by inhibiting the formation of oxidative products.

The electrochemical behavior of dopamine was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. By using a PMeT-modified glassy carbon (GC/PMeT) electrode, DA and Ascorbic Acid (AA) signals could be separated but the AA at high concentrations still caused significant interference by overlapping the DA peak. In comparison to the GC/PMeT electrode, the glassy carbon (GC/Nafion/PMeT) electrode modified with hybrid film Nafion/PMeT was found to permit a superior separation by shifting the oxidation of AA peak toward the less positive potential. The DPV curves for a mixture of DA and AA at an GC/Nafion/PMeT electrode in a 0.1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> solution showed peaks of DA and AA, at 0.45 and 0.21 V, respectively, indicating that the difference in the oxidation potential was 240 mV. In the 0.1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> solution, the oxidation peak current on the differential pulse voltammograms for the GC/PMeT electrode increased linearly with the concentration of DA in the range 1 × 10-6 to 1 × 10-3 M, and the oxidation peak current on the differential pulse voltammograms for the GC/Nafion/PMeT electrode in the range 5 × 10-7 to 2 × 10-4 M. The DA detection sensitivity of the GC/Nafion/PMeT electrode (26.7 μA μM-1 cm-2) was 22 times higher than that of the GC/PMeT electrode (1.21 μA μM-1 cm-2). © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ascorbic Acid; Dopamine; Electrochemical; Nafion; Polymethylthiophene; Ascorbic Acids; Concentration Of; Detection Sensitivity; Differential Pulse Voltammetry; Differential Pulse Voltammograms; Electroactive; Electrochemical Behaviors; High Concentration; Hybrid Film; Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode; Oxidation Peak; Oxidation Potentials; Poly(3-methylthiophene) (pmet); Positive Potential; Selective Detection; Voltammetric Analysis; Bioelectric Phenomena; Brain; Cyclic Voltammetry; Glass Membrane Electrodes; Ketones; Organic Acids; Oxidation; Glassy Carbon","Ascorbic acids; Concentration of; Detection sensitivity; Differential pulse voltammetry; Differential pulse voltammograms; Electroactive; Electrochemical behaviors; High concentration; Hybrid film; Modified glassy carbon electrode; Oxidation peak; Oxidation potentials; Poly(3-methylthiophene) (pMeT); Positive potential; Selective detection; Voltammetric analysis; Bioelectric phenomena; Brain; Cyclic voltammetry; Glass membrane electrodes; Ketones; Organic acids; Oxidation; Glassy carbon","","","Acknowledgements The authors thank the Core University Program between the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST).

Three reactors were operated without aeration (control reactor, CR), with cyclic 6-h aeration and 6-h non-aeration (intermittently aerated reactor, IAR), and with continuous aeration (continuously aerated reactor, CAR). Each reactor was loaded with high-organic solid waste. The performance of IAR was highest among the reactors up to day 90. The respective solid weight, organic matter content, and waste volume on day 90 in the CR, IAR, and CAR were 50.9, 39.1, and 47.5%; 46.5, 29.3 and 35.0%; and 69, 38, and 53% of the initial values. Organic carbon and nitrogen compounds in leachate in the IAR and the CAR showed significant decreases in comparison to those in the CR. The most probable number (MPN) values of fungal 18S rDNA in the CAR and the IAR were higher than those in the CR. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that unique and diverse eubacterial and archaeal communities were formed in the IAR. The intermittent aeration strategy was favorable for initiation of solubilization of organic matter by the aerobic fungal populations and the reduction of the acid formation phase. Then the anaerobic H<inf>2</inf>-producing bacteria Clostridium became dominant in the IAR. Sulfate-reducing bacteria, which cannot use acetate/sulfate but which instead use various organics/sulfate as the electron donor/acceptor were also dominant in the IAR. Consequently, Methanosarcinales, which are acetate-utilizing methanogens, became the dominant archaea in the IAR, where high methane production was observed. © 2009 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Accelerative Stabilization; Bacteria; Intermittent Aeration; Landfill Bioreactors; Methanogens; Acetic Acid; Methane; Sulfate; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Dna, Bacterial; Dna, Ribosomal; Gases; Organic Chemicals; Water Pollutants, Chemical; 18s Rdna; Accelerative Stabilization; Aerated Reactors; Archaea; Archaeal; Control Reactors; Initial Values; Intermittent Aeration; Laboratory Experiments; Landfill Bioreactors; Leachates; Methane Production; Methanosarcinales; Microbial Populations; Most Probable Number; Organic Matter; Organic Matter Content; Organic Solid Wastes; Sulfate Reducing Bacteria; Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms; Bacteriology; Bioconversion; Biogeochemistry; Biological Materials; Bioreactors; Industrial Chemicals; Leachate Treatment; Leaching; Methane; Methanogens; Nitrogen Compounds; Organic Carbon; Population Dynamics; Solid Wastes; Stabilization; Refuse Disposal; Acetic Acid; Acid; Methane; Organic Carbon; Organic Compound; Organic Matter; Organic Nitrogen; Sulfate; Aeration; Aerobic Reactor; Archaebacterium; Article; Clostridium; Community Structure; Controlled Study; Electron Transport; Eubacterium; Fungus; Landfill; Landfill Bioreactor; Landfill Leachate; Microbial Diversity; Microbial Population Dynamics; Nonhuman; Reduction; Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism; Solid Waste Management; Solubilization; Sulfate Reducing Bacterium; Aerobiosis; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Dna, Bacterial; Dna, Ribosomal; Energy Metabolism; Gases; Methanosarcina; Organic Chemicals; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Bacteria (microorganisms)","18S rDNA; Accelerative stabilization; Aerated reactors; Archaea; Archaeal; Control reactors; Initial values; Intermittent aeration; Laboratory experiments; Landfill bioreactors; Leachates; Methane production; Methanosarcinales; Microbial populations; Most probable number; Organic matter; Organic matter content; Organic solid wastes; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms; Bacteriology; Bioconversion; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Bioreactors; Industrial chemicals; Leachate treatment; Leaching; Methane; Methanogens; Nitrogen compounds; Organic carbon; Population dynamics; Solid wastes; Stabilization; Refuse disposal; acetic acid; acid; methane; organic carbon; organic compound; organic matter; organic nitrogen; sulfate; aeration; aerobic reactor; Archaebacterium; article; Clostridium; community structure; controlled study; electron transport; Eubacterium; fungus; landfill; landfill bioreactor; landfill leachate; microbial diversity; microbial population dynamics; nonhuman; reduction; restriction fragment length polymorphism; solid waste management; solubilization; sulfate reducing bacterium; Aerobiosis; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Energy Metabolism; Gases; Methanosarcina; Organic Chemicals; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Bacteria (microorganisms)","","acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1; methane, 74-82-8; sulfate, 14808-79-8; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; DNA, Bacterial, 0; DNA, Ribosomal, 0; Gases, 0; Organic Chemicals, 0; Water Pollutants, Chemical, 0","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Core University Program between the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology (VAST).

The chemical structures of the DHCA/PLLA polyesters were confirmed by FT-IR and 1H NMR measurements. All of the polyesters showed high photoreactivities independent of LLA content. Furthermore, the polyesters had high solubility even after UV irradiation. Interestingly, the thermal stability and mechanical properties of PLLA were improved depending on the incorporation ratio of the DHCA moiety into the backbone. The hydrolysis speed of the DHCA/PLLA polyesters decreased upon increasing the composition of LLA, but the pure PLLA presented the highest hydrolysis speed. Furthermore, all of the polyesters showed faster hydrolysis after UV irradiation as compared to the uncross-linked samples.

For control rice, during storage there was a decrease in protein and starch digestibility, increase in setback viscosity (SV), final viscosity (FV) and pasting temperature (PT), while peak viscosity (PV) increased rapidly for the first 2 months then decreased. The HSTs at 70 and 80°C were effective in maintaining a high value of starch digestibility and low value of PV during storage, while the HSTs at 60°C retarded changes of PV and FV values.

Consequently, the influences of HST on quality of stored rice were complicated. HSTs were effective in retarding an increasing rate of fat acidity, reduced total amylose and insoluble amylose, improved starch digestibility, PV and FV properties of stored rice while they decreased protein digestibility and induced high soluble sugar content. Although HSTs could not improve all of the mentioned quality properties, the obtained benefits could contribute to rice quality maintenance during storage. Depending on maintenance purposes, the applied HST temperature and exposure time could be regulated. IV Conclusions In the present study, a range of nutritional and pasting properties of rice has been examined. For the control rice, the decrease of nutritional values was clarified during storage. In addition, the pronounced changes of pasting properties were also determined. The above changes affected rice quality significantly, requiring quality maintenance measures. In the present study, HST influenced the nutritional and pasting properties differently. HSTs at 70 and 80°C were effective in keeping high value of starch digestibility and low value of PV during storage, while HSTs at 60°C retarded changes in both PV and FV values. Low FV values were also found in 70 and 80°C HST rice after 6 months storage. The results in both the present research and previous research (Nguyen and Goto, 2009) show that HST could improve rice quality during storage. Consequently, the HST could be an alternative technique for quality management of rice during storage.

Depending on the DNA segment that a nuleosome incorporated, its histone proteins exihibit paticular modifications by added some functional chemical groups to specific amino acids. The key approach up to now to determining the DNA locations of histone occupancy as well as histone modifications is an experimental technique called ChiP-Chip, or Chromatin Immunoprecipitation on Microarray Chip. This experimental technique has some disadvantages such as it is tedious, wastes time and money, produces noise, and cannot provide results at an arbitrarily high resolution, especially with large genomes like human's. We have developed a computational method to determine qualitatively histone-occupied as well as acetylation and methylation locations in DNA sequences. The method is based on support vector machines (SVMs) to learn models from training data sets that discriminate between areas with high and low levels of histone occupancy, acetylation or methylation. Our computational method can give quickly the prediction at any position in a DNA sequence based on the content and context of the subsequence around that position. The prediction results on the yeast genome by three-fold cross-validation showed high accuracy and were consistent with the ones from experimental methods. Moreover, SVM-classification models in our method can present genetic preferences of DNA areas that have high modification levels. ©2007 IEEE. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetylation; Histone Modifications; Methylation; Support Vector Machine (svm); Acetylation; Alkylation; Amines; Amino Acids; Bioassay; Biochips; Bioinformatics; Chemical Modification; Computational Methods; Dna; Experiments; Gears; Gene Expression; Genes; Image Retrieval; Mathematical Models; Methylation; Microarrays; Multilayer Neural Networks; Nucleic Acids; Organic Acids; Support Vector Machines; Vectors; Classification Models; Cross Validations; Dna Molecules; Dna Segments; Experimental Methods; Experimental Techniques; Functional Chemicals; High Accuracies; High Resolutions; Histone Modifications; Histone Octamers; Histone Proteins; Immunoprecipitation; Nucleosome Structures; Support Vector Machine (svm); Training Data Sets; Yeast Genomes; Dna Sequences","Acetylation; Alkylation; Amines; Amino acids; Bioassay; Biochips; Bioinformatics; Chemical modification; Computational methods; DNA; Experiments; Gears; Gene expression; Genes; Image retrieval; Mathematical models; Methylation; Microarrays; Multilayer neural networks; Nucleic acids; Organic acids; Support vector machines; Vectors; Classification models; Cross validations; DNA molecules; Dna segments; Experimental methods; Experimental techniques; Functional chemicals; High accuracies; High resolutions; Histone modifications; Histone octamers; Histone proteins; Immunoprecipitation; Nucleosome structures; Support vector machine (SVM); Training data sets; Yeast genomes; DNA sequences","","","","Bernstein, Bradley E., Global nucleosome occupancy in yeast., Genome Biology, 5, 9, (2004); Brank, Janez, Feature selection using support vector machines, Management Information Systems, 6, pp. 261-273, (2002); Buck, Michael Joseph, ChIP-chip: Considerations for the design, analysis, and application of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, Genomics, 83, 3, pp. 349-360, (2004); Carrozza, Michael J., Histone H3 methylation by Set2 directs deacetylation of coding regions by Rpd3S to suppress spurious intragenic transcription, Cell, 123, 4, pp. 581-592, (2005); Cherry, James Michael, SGD: Saccharomyces genome database, Nucleic Acids Research, 26, 1, pp. 73-79, (1998); An Introduction to Support Vector Machines, (2000); Guyon, Isabelle M., Gene selection for cancer classification using support vector machines, Machine Learning, 46, 1-3, pp. 389-422, (2002); Keogh, Michael Christopher, Cotranscriptional set2 methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 recruits a repressive Rpd3 complex, Cell, 123, 4, pp. 593-605, (2005); Kouzarides, Tony, Histone methylation in transcriptional control, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development, 12, 2, pp. 198-209, (2002); Kurdistani, Siavash K., Mapping global histone acetylation patterns to gene expression, Cell, 117, 6, pp. 721-733, (2004)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society; IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society; IEEE Computer Society; Biological and Artificial Intelligence Society (BAIS)","7th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering, BIBE","","Boston, MA","72698","","1424415098; 9781424415090","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-47649121776"

Thus, the solvents should be recovered for re-use in these processes by distillation methods, and vapor-liquid equilibrium data are necessary for the design and operation of distillation columns. These data can be estimated using activity coefficient models. In this work, artificial neural networks were applied to predict and estimate vapor-liquid equilibrium data for ternary systems saturated with salt. The databases taken from literature were split into training, validating and testing data and the best architecture was an 8-6-7-4 network. The absolute mean errors for the whole database were 0.0166, 0.0177, 0.0151 for the vapor mole fraction of components (y<inf>1</inf>, y<inf>2</inf>, y<inf>3</inf>) and 0.74 °C for the bubble point temperature.

To demonstrate the regional circulation, a plan of ""Biomass Town"" were drawn to meet the situation in the South-East Asia. The basic concept of Biomass Town is to utilize the biomass resources obtained in the region efficiently and economically, minimizing the waste energy and materials. It is important to understand and respect the individuality of the region for successful energy and material circulations. The Mekong Delta area, Vietnam, was the focus as one of the promising region for Biomass Town. The concept and system design for the biomass refinery based on the rice cropping, development of ethanol production process from rice straw/husk, and total design of Biomass Town in Mekong area, based on the analyses of the material and energy flow in the region were presented.

EIS experiments were realized onto a flawless zone, which surrounds an artificial hole of the coating using the Luo's cell or a removable cell. EIS spectra were analyzed first with classic equivalent circuits and then with an approach involving the dipolar relaxation of polymer layer. These two models were unable to explain the experimental data, especially for a long immersion experiments. Taking into account the presence of vacuoles, namely pre-existing air pockets that will be then filled by electrolyte, modified equivalent circuits were used and a good representation of experimental data was obtained. The parameters extracted allowed the coating degradation to be followed. It was found that a solvent-free coating exhibited the best compatibility with cathodic protection. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Marble of calcite type (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) was exposed to outdoor atmospheric environment with and without a rain shelter at four test sites in the southern part of Vietnam for 3-month, 1- and 2-year periods from July 2001 to September 2003. The thickness loss of marble was investigated gravimetrically. X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescent methods were applied to study corrosion products on marble. The corrosion product of marble was only gypsum (CaSO <inf>4</inf>·2H<inf>2</inf>O) and was washed out by rain under the unsheltered exposure condition. It was found that the most substantial factors influencing the corrosion of marble were rainfall, SO<inf>2</inf> concentration in the air and relative humidity.

The M̄<inf>w</inf> of chitosan was reduced from 48 to 9.1 kDa by irradiation. The characteristics of irradiated chitosan were analysed by using Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy and an elemental analyser. The amino group was found to be stable, whereas the C-O-C group decreased with increase in the dose. The product of chitosan irradiated at 100 kGy with an M̄<inf>w</inf> of approx. 16 kDa showed the strongest growth promotion effect on plants in vitro. For shoot culture, supplementation with irradiated chitosan increased the fresh biomass of shoot clusters (7.2-17.0%) as well as the shoot multiplication rate (17.9-69.0%) for Chrysanthemum morifolium (florist's chrysanthemum), Limonium latifolium (limonium or sea-lavender), Eustoma grandiflorum (lisianthus, tulip gentian or Texas bluebell) and Fragaria ananassa (modern garden strawberry). The optimum concentrations of irradiated chitosan were found to be approx. 70-100 mg/l for chrysanthemum, 50-100 mg/l for lisianthus and 30-100 mg/l for limonium. For the plantlet culture, the optimum concentrations were found to be approx. 100 mg/l for chrysanthemum, 30 mg/l for lisianthus, 40 mg/l for limonium and 50 mg/l for strawberry. Supplementation with optimum concentrations of irradiated chitosan resulted in a significant increase in the fresh biomass (68.1 % for chrysanthemum, 48.5% for lisianthus, 53.6% for limonium and 26.4% for strawberry), shoot height (19.4 % for chrysanthemum, 16.5 % for lisianthus, 33.9 % for limonium and 25.9% for strawberry) and root length (40.6 % for chrysanthemum, 66.9 % for lisianthus, 23.4% for limonium and 22.6% for strawberry). In addition, treatment with irradiated chitosan enhanced the activity of chitosanase in treated plants and also improved the survival ratio and growth of the transferred plantlets acclimatized for 10-30 days under greenhouse conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Chitosan; Irradiation; Oligochitosan; Plant Growth Promotion; Plantlet; Shoot Cluster; Chitosan; Chitosan; Acetylation; Amino Acids; Biomass; Degradation; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Gamma Rays; Molecular Weight; Chitosan; Deacetylation; Molecular Mass; Survival Ratio; Plants (botany); Chitosan; Acclimatization; Article; Biomass; Chrysanthemum; Chrysanthemum Morifolium; Deacetylation; Degradation Kinetics; Drug Activity; Enzyme Activity; Eustoma Grandiflorum; Greenhouse; Growth Stimulation; In Vitro Study; Infrared Spectroscopy; Limonium; Limonium Latifolium; Molecular Weight; Nonhuman; Plant; Plant Growth; Radiation Response; Strawberry; Dose-response Relationship, Radiation; Gamma Rays; Molecular Weight; Plant Shoots; Plants; Radiation Dosage; Campanula Rotundifolia; Chrysanthemum X Morifolium; Eustoma; Fragaria; Fragaria X Ananassa; Gentiana; Lavandula Angustifolia; Tulipa","Acetylation; Amino acids; Biomass; Degradation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gamma rays; Molecular weight; Chitosan; Deacetylation; Molecular mass; Survival ratio; Plants (botany); chitosan; acclimatization; article; biomass; Chrysanthemum; chrysanthemum morifolium; deacetylation; degradation kinetics; drug activity; enzyme activity; Eustoma grandiflorum; greenhouse; growth stimulation; in vitro study; infrared spectroscopy; Limonium; Limonium latifolium; molecular weight; nonhuman; plant; plant growth; radiation response; strawberry; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Gamma Rays; Molecular Weight; Plant Shoots; Plants; Radiation Dosage; Campanula rotundifolia; Chrysanthemum x morifolium; Eustoma; Fragaria; Fragaria x ananassa; Gentiana; Lavandula angustifolia; Tulipa","","chitosan, 9012-76-4; Chitosan, 9012-76-4","","Kumar, Majeti N.V.Ravi, A review of chitin and chitosan applications, Reactive and Functional Polymers, 46, 1, pp. 1-27, (2000); Chitin Handbook, (1997); Eiden, Catherine A., Interaction of lead and chromium with chitin and chitosan, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 25, 8, pp. 1587-1599, (1980); Tay, Lingfong, Alginate–chitosan coacervation in production of artificial seeds, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 42, 4, pp. 449-454, (1993); Matsuhashi, Shinpei, Enhancement of antimicrobial activity of chitosan by irradiation, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 73, 2, pp. 237-241, (1997); Vasyukova, N.

Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding 16S rRNA allowed 2TN-NB to be identified as Acinetobacter sp. and the other three stains as Pseudomonas sp. Among the four isolates, 2TN-NB was most effective in degrading crude oil: in 1 d, it degraded 95% of the crude oil in the culture medium (5%, v/v). The isolated strains could also degrade a sulfur- containing aromatic hydrocarbon, dibenzothiophene (DBT), with low efficiency. Except for MVK2-5, which degraded crude oil least efficiently, the isolates produced biosurfactants in amounts sufficient for structural analysis. FT-IR measurement suggested that strains 6TBX-CL and XCK produced glycolipid-type biosurfactants while that produced by 2TN-NB was of the polysaccharide type. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acinetobacter; Biosurfactant; Dibenzothiophene; Petroleum Degradation; Pseudomonas; Petroleum; Aromatic Hydrocarbon; Dibenzothiophene Derivative; Glycolipid; Nucleotide; Oil; Petroleum; Polysaccharide; Rna 16s; Sulfur Derivative; Surfactant; Acinetobacter; Article; Bacterium Identification; Controlled Study; Culture Medium; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Pseudomonas; Time; Viet Nam; Acinetobacter Sp.; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas Sp.","aromatic hydrocarbon; dibenzothiophene derivative; glycolipid; nucleotide; oil; petroleum; polysaccharide; RNA 16S; sulfur derivative; surfactant; Acinetobacter; article; bacterium identification; controlled study; culture medium; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Pseudomonas; time; Viet Nam; Acinetobacter sp.; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas sp.","","petroleum, 8002-05-9","","Atlas, Ronald M., Microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons: An environmental perspective, Microbiological Reviews, 45, 1, pp. 180-209, (1981); Leahy, Joseph G., Microbial degradation of hydrocarbons in the environment, Microbiological Reviews, 54, 3, pp. 305-315, (1990); Margesin, Rosa, Efficiency of indigenous and inoculated cold-adapted soil microorganisms for biodegradation of diesel oil in alpine soils, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 63, 7, pp. 2660-2664, (1997); Coleman, Harold J., Identification of Benzo[b]thiophene and its 2- and 3-Methyl Homologs in Wasson, Texas, Crude Oil, Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data, 6, 3, pp. 464-468, (1961); Izumi, Yoshikazu, Selective desulfurization of dibenzothiophene by Rhodococcus erythropolis D-1, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 60, 1, pp. 223-226, (1994); Morikawa, Masaaki, Isolation of a new mixotrophic bacterium which can fix C02 and assimilate aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons anaerobically, Journal of Fermentation and Bioengineering, 76, 4, pp. 280-283, (1993); Biosurfactants and Biotechnology, (1987); Oberbremer, A., Effect of the addition of microbial surfactants on hydrocarbon degradation in a soil population in a stirred reactor, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 32, 4, pp. 485-489, (1990); Morikawa, Masaaki, A new lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by Arthrobacter sp. strain MIS38, Journal of Bacteriology, 175, 20, pp. 6459-6466, (1993); Jarvis, F.
