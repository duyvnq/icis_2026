However, their socio-environmental impacts, especially on vulnerable and marginalized communities, remain underexplored. This study examines the impacts of the Xoong Con SHP in north-central Vietnam through an integrated approach combining remote sensing, household surveys, random forest classification, focus group discussion and key informant interviews. Grounded in the frameworks of livelihood vulnerability, political ecology of water, and energy justice, the study investigates how flood exposure, land loss, and governance structures affect local well-being and equity. Our findings reveal that land loss is the most significant structural driver of near-poverty, particularly among households that lost agricultural or aquaculture land. Gender and age emerged as key determinants of economic vulnerability, with single female-headed households disproportionately affected. Remote sensing analysis confirmed significant flooding in downstream agricultural areas, corroborating local perceptions of hydrological change. While the hydropower company has provided some community support, limited awareness and unequal benefit distribution undermine its effectiveness. This study highlights critical gaps in both distributive and procedural justice in SHP development. It underscores the importance of disaggregated social impact assessments, gender-sensitive planning, and inclusive benefit-sharing mechanisms. Without such measures, small-scale hydropower risks reinforcing structural inequalities and livelihood insecurities rather than promoting sustainable development. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers, planners, and energy developers to ensure SHPs contribute to both low-carbon transitions and socially just outcomes across hydropower-dependent regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Justice; Gendered Impacts; Livelihood Vulnerability; Remote Sensing; Small-scale Hydropower; Vietnam","","","","This publication was funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) under Mekong- Australia Partnership (MAP) \u2013 Water, Energy and Climate (WEC) Program for the Mekong Think Tanks program.

This paper evaluates the environmental implications of this novel mode through a comprehensive integrated Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment (MFA-LCA) approach, focusing on plastic waste and waste paper streams across six major economies (China, EU, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States). Results reveal that current waste-importing nations generally exhibit higher life cycle carbon footprints for recycling processes compared to exporters. Specifically, exporters generate 200.08–400.21 kg CO₂-eq/t for waste paper and 191.49–339.33 kg CO₂-eq/t for plastic waste, while importers produce 214.53–340.96 kg CO₂-eq/t for waste paper and 377.88–629.67 kg CO₂-eq/t for plastic waste, demonstrating a clear disparity in emissions intensity. Under the SRCEM, transitioning to domestic recycling coupled with exporting recycled materials in waste exporting countries result in a substantial carbon reduction of approximately 20.00–166.25 kg CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/t for waste paper and 23.06–522.08 kg CO<inf>2</inf>-eq/t for plastic waste in most cases compared with the current mode. These findings indicate the potential carbon reduction benefits of emerging trade mode and provide empirical evidence for their adoption in international policy frameworks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Basel Convention; Carbon Reduction; Environmental Impacts; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Plastic Waste; Secondary Resources Circulation; Waste Trade; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Economy; Circular Economy; Environmental Protection; International Trade; Kyoto Protocol; Life Cycle; Life Cycle Assessment; Plastic Recycling; Public Policy; Waste Paper; Basel Convention; Carbon Reduction; Carbon Reduction Potentials; Case-studies; Plastics Waste; Secondary Resource Circulation; Secondary Resources; Waste Trade; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Emission Control; Environmental Impact; Life Cycle Analysis; Plastic Waste; Recycling; Trade-environment Relations; Carbon Dioxide; Foreign Trade; Life Cycle Assessment; Paper; Plastics; Wastes; China; Japan; Thailand; United States; Viet Nam","Carbon; Carbon cycle; Carbon Economy; Circular economy; Environmental protection; International trade; Kyoto Protocol; Life cycle; Life cycle assessment; Plastic recycling; Public policy; Waste paper; Basel Convention; Carbon reduction; Carbon reduction potentials; Case-studies; Plastics waste; Secondary resource circulation; Secondary resources; Waste trade; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; plastic waste; recycling; trade-environment relations; Carbon Dioxide; Foreign Trade; Life Cycle Assessment; Paper; Plastics; Wastes; China; Japan; Thailand; United States; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: This study is financially supported by \u201CNational Natural Science Foundation of China\u201D (72274105) and Key Technologies Research and Development Program (2019YFC1904800).

Globally, nutrition professionals in clinical settings are dietitians. However, many healthcare workers with different educational backgrounds are employed at nutrition departments of hospitals in Vietnam. No earlier study has attempted to evaluate the competence of the nutrition workforce. Our objective was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of the current nutrition workforce in Vietnam. Methods: A cross-sectional healthcare facility-based study was conducted with 256 employees working at nutrition departments of 75 public hospitals from 7 October to 19 November 2023. Clinical nutritional KAP was evaluated via a questionnaire. KAP levels were categorized as ≥ 50% “adequate” and < 50% ""inadequate"". The chi-square test and logistic regression were used for bivariate analyses of categorical independent variables. T tests and Mann‒Whitney U tests were used for bivariate analyses of interval ratio variables. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the determinants of KAP. The significance level was defined as p < 0.05. Results: The proportion of the nutrition workforce with adequate clinical nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and practices was 62.9%, 65.2%, and 62.9%, respectively. Compared with non-qualified nutrition professional (non-QNPs), QNPs accounted for a significantly greater proportion of those with adequate clinical knowledge (80.2% vs. 54.1%, p < 0.001) and practice (86.1% vs. 51.2%, p < 0.001). The determinants of having adequate clinical nutrition knowledge were identified: (i) being responsible for clinical nutrition; (ii) being responsible for food safety and hygiene monitoring; (iii) working at a high-level hospital; and (iv) working at hospitals in Hanoi. Adequate clinical nutrition practices were determined by (i) serving as a dietetic preceptor; (ii) having adequate clinical nutrition knowledge; and (iii) working at hospitals in Hanoi. Undergraduate educational background was the only determinant of having adequate positive attitudes of the nutrition workforce. Conclusions: Non-QNPs had slightly poorer clinical nutrition knowledge and practice than QNPs. Medical doctors and preventative medicine doctors demonstrated poorer attitudes toward nutrition-related tasks than dietitians. The study recommended that hospitals in Vietnam employ QNPs (dietitians) rather than recruiting non-QNPs. Alternatively, non-QNPs should be gradually replaced by QNPs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes; Clinical Nutrition; Knowledge; Nutrition Workforce; Practices; Adult; Attitude To Health; Clinical Competence; Cross-sectional Study; Dietitian; Female; Health Personnel Attitude; Hospital Personnel; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Public Hospital; Questionnaire; Viet Nam; Adult; Attitude Of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritionists; Personnel, Hospital; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam","adult; attitude to health; clinical competence; cross-sectional study; dietitian; female; health personnel attitude; hospital personnel; human; male; middle aged; public hospital; questionnaire; Viet Nam; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritionists; Personnel, Hospital; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","","This study received research grants from the School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki University, Japan, and the Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan.","Correia, Maria Isabel Toulson Davisson, Hospital malnutrition in Latin America: A systematic review, Clinical Nutrition, 36, 4, pp. 958-967, (2017); Inciong, Jesus Fernando B., Hospital malnutrition in northeast and southeast Asia: A systematic literature review, Clinical Nutrition ESPEN, 39, pp. 30-45, (2020); Lam, Nien Vinh, High prevalence and burden of adult malnutrition at a tertiary hospital: An opportunity to use nutrition-focused care to improve outcomes, Clinical Nutrition Open Science, 40, pp. 79-88, (2021); Cost Savings Associated with Nutritional Support in Medical Inpatients an Economic Model Based on Data from A Systematic Review of Randomised Trials, (2021); Asian J Diet, (2022); Holmes, Rebecca A., Role of dietitians in reducing malnutrition in hospital, CMAJ.

Adaptation to posed threats requires an understanding of hydrological responses to climate variability. Whilst these can be computationally modelled, observed streamflow data is essential for constraining models, and understanding and quantifying emerging trends in the water cycle. To date, the identification of such trends at the global scale has been hindered by data limitations – in particular, the prevalence of direct human influences on streamflow which can obscure climate-driven variability. By removing these influences, trends in streamflow data can be more confidently attributed to climate variability. Here we describe the Reference Observatory of Basins for INternational hydrological climate change detection (ROBIN) – the first iteration of a global network of streamflow data from national reference hydrological networks (RHNs) – comprised of catchments which are near-natural or have limited human influences. This collaboration has established a freely available global RHN dataset of over 3,000 catchments and code libraries, which can be used to underpin new science endeavours and advance change detection studies to support international climate policy and adaptation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Catchment Area (hydrology); Climate Change; Human; Prevalence; Water Cycle","article; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; human; prevalence; water cycle","","","The ROBIN (Reference Observatory of Basins for INternational hydrological climate change detection) project was funded the UK Natural Environment Research Council Global Partnership Seedcorn Fund - NE/W004038/1 and the NC-International programme -NE/X006247/1 delivering National Capability.

This limitation has hindered our ability to identify broad patterns and mechanisms across taxa and ecosystems. To address this, we present StoichLife, a global dataset of 28,049 records from 5,876 species spanning terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Compiled from published and unpublished sources, StoichLife documents elemental content and stoichiometric ratios (%C, %N, %P, C:N, C:P, and N:P) for individual plants and animals. The dataset is standardized and, where available, includes information on taxonomy, habitat, body mass (for animals), geography, and environmental conditions such as temperature, solar radiation, and nutrient availability. By providing an unprecedented breadth of organismal stoichiometry, StoichLife enables the exploration of global patterns, ecological and evolutionary drivers, and context-dependent variations. This resource advances our understanding of the chemical makeup of life and its responses to environmental change, supporting progress in ecological stoichiometry and related fields. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Animal; Chemistry; Ecosystem; Plant; Animals; Carbon; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plants","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; animal; chemistry; ecosystem; plant; Animals; Carbon; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plants","","carbon, 7440-44-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus","This paper is a joint effort of the working group sBiomaps kindly supported by sDiv, the Synthesis Centre of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, funded by the German Research Foundation (FZT 118, 202548816).

In the present study, we introduce an often-overlooked cultural factor – religiosity – to explore its influence on the relationship between being in love and five dimensions of subjective well-being. We conducted two cross-cultural studies with 31,608 participants from 117 samples across 83 societies. Our findings reveal that, in more religious cultures, being in love is a weaker predictor of well-being compared to more secular cultures in four out of six models. These findings indicate that national context influences the relative importance of various emotions and experiences for well-being, underscoring the need to account for cultural context in research on love. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Love; Religiosity; Well-being","","","","This work was supported by the Polish National Science Centre under grant 2020/38/E/HS6/00357 ; Hungarian OTKA Grant K-111 789 ; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development Grant 301298/2018-1 ; NPO \u201C Systemic Risk Institute \u201D Grant LX22NPO5101 funded by the European Union\u2013Next Generation EU (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, NPO: EXCELES, Czechia); University of Roma Department of Educational Studies Grant DSF 2017-2018 ; HSE University Basic Research Program; Ongoing Research Funding Program (ORF-2025-1204), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia ; ESRC grant number ES/W00786X/1 ; Ministry of Science, Technological Development, and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia ( 451-03-66/2024-03/200163 ).","Alarcon, Gene M., Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope, Personality and Individual Differences, 54, 7, pp. 821-827, (2013); Berkessel, Jana B., National religiosity eases the psychological burden of poverty, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 39, (2021); Boulis, Christopher, Religion as a Determinant of Relationship Stability, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 63, 2, pp. 281-306, (2024); Chen, Beiwen, Basic psychological need satisfaction, need frustration, and need strength across four cultures, Motivation and Emotion, 39, 2, pp. 216-236, (2015); Cherniak, Aaron D., Attachment theory and religion, Current Opinion in Psychology, 40, pp. 126-130, (2021); Young Children of Black Immigrants in America Changing Flows Changing Faces, (2012); undefined; Çukur, Cem Şafak, Religiosity, values, and horizontal and vertical individualism—collectivism: A study of turkey, the united states, and the philippines, Journal of Social Psychology, 144, 6, pp. 613-634, (2004); Deci, Edward L., The ""what"" and ""why"" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior, Psychological Inquiry, 11, 4, pp. 227-268, (2000); Diener, Edward F., The Satisfaction With Life Scale, Journal of Personality Assessment, 49, 1, pp. 71-75, (1985)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01471767","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009905086"

We hypothesized that individuals in romantic relationships would report higher well-being (measured as happiness, harmony, and meaning in life) compared to singles. We anticipated that in cultures prioritizing relationships, the benefits of being coupled would be amplified, while in societies emphasizing autonomy, the well-being gap would diminish. Specifically, we posited that values prevalent in WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic)–such as self-direction and achievement–would positively moderate the association between relationship status and well-being, whereas values characteristic of non-WEIRD societies–such as tradition and conformity–would have a negative moderating effect. Our findings support that coupled individuals generally report higher well-being; however, the moderating effects of cultural values were more complex than expected. Cultural classifications of WEIRD and non-WEIRD did not consistently explain the well-being gap. Interestingly, in cultures emphasizing conformity, single and coupled individuals both reported greater meaning, leading to an overall decrease in the well-being gap. Conversely, higher self-direction values were associated with a wider well-being gap, with singles experiencing decreased happiness and meaning. These findings suggest that values such as conformity and self-direction exert domain-specific effects on well-being, influenced by broader social context and individual perceptions. Our research highlights the necessity of integrating cultural and individual factors in well-being research to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the quality of life for singles and those in relationships. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Relationship Status; Schwartz Values; Singles; Well-being; Adult; Article; Cultural Anthropology; Cultural Value; Female; Happiness; Human; Love; Major Clinical Study; Male; Quality Of Life; Social Environment; Wellbeing","adult; article; cultural anthropology; cultural value; female; happiness; human; love; major clinical study; male; quality of life; social environment; wellbeing","","","The present research was supported by multiple funding sources.

However, previous studies have faced challenges in evaluating bus movements and their interactions with road users, such as an inability to distinguish between lane and speed changes of buses, the significant effort required for data collection, and a lack of comprehensive coverage of all buses in the survey area. This study addresses these gaps with an expanded model that comprehensively evaluates bus driver behavior, considering the interactions between buses and motorcycles. The proposed model utilizes traffic surveillance video data analyzed through specialized software and incorporates eight indices to significantly address the limitations of previous studies. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a case study was conducted in Hanoi using the T-surveyor program for data analysis. The findings revealed that: (1) bus lane changes had a significantly greater negative impact on motorcyclists compared to bus speed changes; (2) bus movement situations affecting motorcycles were more frequent in the Bus-Motorcycle-Car (BMC) flow than in the Bus-Motorcycle (BM) flow; and (3) in most cases, the frequency of bus-related situations impacting motorcycles was lower on weekends than on weekdays. The expanded model also identified various hazardous bus movement situations. Furthermore, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was applied to compare the likelihood of motorcycles changing lanes and speeds in response to bus movements between BMC and BM flows. Lastly, this study demonstrated the expanded model's practicality and its potential for broader implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bus Movement; Driving Behavior; Mixed Traffic Flow; Motorcyclists; Propensity Score Matching; T-surveyor; Assessment Method; Bus Transport; Movement; Numerical Model; Road Traffic; Road Transport; Software; Survey Method; Travel Behavior; Hanoi; Viet Nam","assessment method; bus transport; movement; numerical model; road traffic; road transport; software; survey method; travel behavior; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan under Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho: MEXT) Scholarships.","J Soc Automot Eng Malays, (2021); Asplund, Disa, Optimal fares and frequencies for bus services in a small city, Research in Transportation Economics, 80, (2020); Behnood, Ali, Determinant of injury severities in large truck crashes: A weekly instability analysis, Safety Science, 131, (2020); Nguyen, Caocao, Estimating Capacity and Motorcycle Equivalent Units on Urban Roads in Hanoi, Vietnam, Journal of Transportation Engineering, 138, 6, pp. 776-785, (2012); Choudhary, Pushpa, Impacts of speed variations on freeway crashes by severity and vehicle type, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 121, pp. 213-222, (2018); Deb, Saikat, Passenger's perception about city buses in the aftermath of COVID 19: Experience from Guwahati city, India, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 85, (2023); Deng, Jianhua, A multilane cellular automaton multi-attribute lane-changing decision model, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 529, (2019); Gitelman, Victoria, A trial to allow motorcycles on bus lanes in Tel-Aviv: an assessment of mobility and safety impacts, Transactions on Transport Sciences, 12, 3, pp. 22-33, (2021); Giri, Om Prakash, Road traffic regulation and enforcement status: A Nepalese traffic police perspective, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives, 26, (2024); Gkiotsalitis, Konstantinos, Improving service regularity for high-frequency bus services with rescheduling and bus holding, Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering (English Edition), 8, 5, pp. 778-794, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","2213624X; 22136258","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008328579"

Nevertheless, there is little evidence about whether and how such megaprojects can transform cities for airport-linked development in Asia's emerging economies. This study examines the development impact of new terminal construction with city-aiport expressway connection projects by analyzing changes in nighttime light intensity (NTL) along the new ground transportation corridor in Ha Noi, Viet Nam. In this microgeographic impact analysis, NTL is assumed to indicate the degree of urban economic activity or development. A spatial-temporal dataset was organized on a 500-m grid-cell scale as the unit of analysis covering a 12-km distance buffer area from the new city-airport ground transportation corridor for 2012–2020. Based on a quasi-experimental design framework, difference-in-differences (DID) estimation techniques were applied to pursue causal inference. The results of the DID model analysis present that the impact of new terminal construction with city-airport expressway connection projects on NTL is significantly positive near the new ground transportation corridor. An additional analysis further reveals that the NTL impact tends to be greater near the city center, significant regardless of residential density, and significant in already well-developed locations. These empirical findings highlight the importance of city-airport expressway connection along with strategic land reform programs and land-use rezoning practices in distributing and amplifying the catalytic effects of airport capacity expansion citywide in Asia's emerging economies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","City-airport Connection; Difference-in-differences Estimation; Economic Development; Emerging Economies; Nighttime Light Intensity; Air Transportation; Airport Ground Equipment; Airport Passenger Transportation; Airport Vehicular Traffic; Competition; Ground Vehicles; Heliports; Supply Chains; Airport Capacity; City-airport Connection; Difference-in-difference Estimation; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Economic Development; Emerging Economies; Light Intensity; Night Time Lights; Nighttime Light Intensity; Urban Transportation; Airport; Economic Activity; Economic Development; Light Intensity; Statistical Analysis; Urban Economy; Hanoi; Viet Nam","Air transportation; Airport ground equipment; Airport passenger transportation; Airport vehicular traffic; Competition; Ground vehicles; Heliports; Supply chains; Airport capacity; City-airport connection; Difference-in-difference estimation; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Economic development; Emerging economies; Light intensity; Night time lights; Nighttime light intensity; Urban transportation; airport; economic activity; economic development; light intensity; statistical analysis; urban economy; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","This work was partially supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (Project Number:51280-001, Asia Infrastructure Insights R&D \u201CResearch on the Spatial Characteristics of Airport System Development within Asia\u2019s Developing Cities\u201D) and by the Singapore University of Technology and Design Growth Plan (SGP) \u2013 Aviation (Grant Ref No. PIE-SGP-AN-2020-01, Thrust 5: \u201CThe Growth of Hub-Airports as Employment Centers\u201D).","Abadie, Alberto, Large sample properties of matching estimators for average treatment effects, Econometrica, 74, 1, pp. 235-267, (2006); Affuso, Ermanno, Is airport proximity an amenity or disamenity?

This study assessed the density, composition, and temporal variability of floating plastic waste in the Hau River, approximately 30 km upstream of the Tran De River estuary. Floating net traps were deployed during both ebb and flood tides to quantify plastic waste with simultaneous meteorological and hydrological monitoring. The findings highlight that key meteorological factors, such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, were found to indirectly influence plastic transport by altering surface currents and promoting plastic degradation. Meanwhile, hydrological conditions, especially tidal variability, play a direct and dominant role in determining the spatial and temporal distribution of plastic waste. Plastic debris was diverse in terms of items during both tidal phases. Although the number of plastic pieces was higher at ebb tide (134.33 pieces/h), the volume and concentration of plastic were greater at flood tide (1.22 kg/h and 0.73 kg/m3) than at ebb tide (0.81 kg/h and 0.29 kg/m3). Macroplastic debris was almost dominant during both ebb tide (97.29%) and flood tide (93.96%) compared to megaplastic and mesoplastic size. These findings highlight the importance of integrating tidal and climate factors into plastic waste management and support targeted interventions to reduce plastic discharge into coastal ecosystems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Floating Plastic Debris; Hau River; Plastic Pollution; Riverine Transport; Tidal Influence; Atmospheric Temperature; Ecosystems; Floods; Marine Pollution; Ocean Currents; Plastic Recycling; River Pollution; Rivers; Tides; Waste Management; Wind; Ebb Tides; Floating Plastic Debris; Flood Tide; Hau River; Mekong Delta; Plastic Debris; Plastic Pollutions; Plastics Waste; Riverine Transport; Tidal Influence; Debris; Discharge; Flood; Plastic Waste; River Pollution; Temporal Distribution; Waste Management; Wind Direction; Wind Velocity; Viet Nam","Atmospheric temperature; Ecosystems; Floods; Marine pollution; Ocean currents; Plastic recycling; River pollution; Rivers; Tides; Waste management; Wind; Ebb tides; Floating plastic debris; Flood tide; Hau river; Mekong Delta; Plastic debris; Plastic pollutions; Plastics waste; Riverine transport; Tidal influence; Debris; discharge; flood; plastic waste; river pollution; temporal distribution; waste management; wind direction; wind velocity; Viet Nam","","","","Global Plastics Outlook Economic Drivers Environmental Impacts and Policy Options, (2022); Environment Week 2023 Joining Forces to Beat Plastic Pollution, (2023); Lebreton, Laurent C.M., River plastic emissions to the world's oceans, Nature Communications, 8, (2017); van Calcar, Caroline J., Abundance of plastic debris across European and Asian rivers, Environmental Research Letters, 14, 12, (2019); Report on Plastic Waste Generation in 2022, (2023); Every Year Vietnam Releases 1 8 Million Tons of Plastic Waste into the Environment, (2024); Reducing Plastic Waste Pollution on the Red Riverresults and Lessons Learned from Nam Dinh, (2023); Project Summary Conference Reducing Plastic Waste Pollution on the Red River, (2023); Pressure of Plastic Waste in the Downstream of Vu Giathu Bon River, (2019); Life Cycle of Floating Debris in the Canals of Ho Chi Minh City, (2016)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014315886"

In recent years, many resilience measurements have been developed to assess transport network performance under disruptions. However, few of these assessments precisely capture the variations of individuals’ daily activity-travel patterns that arise in response to TN disruptions. Considering the spatio-temporal correlation between activity behaviour and travel behaviour, this paper presents an activity-based space-time accessibility measure for assessing the resilience of TN. This method integrates individuals’ activity and travel choice behaviours, TN, and activity locations into a unified framework. Multiple scenarios are designed concerning various disruption occurrence times, disruption levels, recovery times, activity location plans, service times at activity location, and transit vehicle headways to comprehensively capture the factors influencing TN resilience. The effectiveness of the proposed measure is demonstrated by a case study in Xi'an City, China. The results indicate that the proposed activity-based approach is capable of reflecting the dynamic performance of TN by considering the attraction of activity locations as well as network topology and passenger flow. The measure enables policymakers to accurately quantify resilience and develop contingency plans by considering how individuals’ activity-travel patterns change following disruptions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activity And Travel Choice Behaviours; Activity-based Approach; Network Resilience; Space-time Accessibility; Computer System Recovery; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Location Based Services; Mass Transportation; Motor Transportation; Traffic Control; Transportation Routes; Urban Growth; Urban Transportation; Activity And Travel Choice Behavior; Activity Locations; Activity-based; Activity-based Approach; Network Resilience; Space-time Accessibility; Sustainable Urban Development; Transit Networks; Travel Choice Behaviours; Urban Areas; Location; Accessibility; Public Transport; Sustainable Development; Travel Behavior; Urban Development; China; Shaanxi; Xian","Computer system recovery; Economic and social effects; Economics; Location based services; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Activity and travel choice behavior; Activity locations; Activity-based; Activity-based approach; Network resilience; Space-time accessibility; Sustainable urban development; Transit networks; Travel choice behaviours; Urban areas; Location; accessibility; public transport; sustainable development; travel behavior; urban development; China; Shaanxi; Xian","","","The research work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 42471498 , 42261144745 ).","Ashiru, Olu, Utility of schedules: Theoretical model of departure-time choice and activity-time allocation with application to individual activity schedules, Transportation Research Record, 1894, pp. 84-98, (2004); Baroud, Hiba, Importance measures for inland waterway network resilience, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 62, pp. 55-67, (2014); Ben-Akiva, Moshe E., Integration of an activity-based model system and a residential location model, Urban Studies, 35, 7, pp. 1131-1153, (1998); Berdica, Katja, An introduction to road vulnerability: What has been done, is done and should be done, Transport Policy, 9, 2, pp. 117-127, (2002); Bergantino, Angela Stefania, Assessing transport network resilience: empirical insights from real-world data studies, Transport Reviews, 44, 4, pp. 834-857, (2024); Boura, Georgia, Incorporating geographic interdependencies into the resilience assessment of multimodal public transport networks, Journal of Transport Geography, 118, (2024); Bruneau, Michel, A Framework to Quantitatively Assess and Enhance the Seismic Resilience of Communities, Earthquake Spectra, 19, 4, pp. 733-752, (2003); Cantelmo, Guido, A utility-based dynamic demand estimation model that explicitly accounts for activity scheduling and duration, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 114, pp. 303-320, (2018); Chan, Raymond, Measuring Transportation System Resilience: Response of Rail Transit to Weather Disruptions, Natural Hazards Review, 17, 1, (2016); Chen, Yuan, Assessing accessibility-based service effectiveness (ABSEV) and social equity for urban bus transit: A sustainability perspective, Sustainable Cities and Society, 44, pp. 499-510, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22106707","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011874733"

The aim of this study is to examine how crop residue burning in Punjab possibly impacts air (aerosol) quality in Delhi in the year 2020 when COVID-19 dominated. In this study we use datasets from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer to evaluate burning activity in Punjab, from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) to assess the vertical distribution of smoke aerosol. The smoke height over Punjab is confirmed by CALIPSO smoke heights and Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory backward trajectories during the burning period. Then forward trajectories starting from Punjab-hotspots are analyzed to identify which area of Punjab emitted the most pollutants to New Delhi. About 15 days with extremely dense crop-residue burning are detected in Punjab leading to a significant increase in aerosol optical depth during the late burning period. During this period, smoke aerosols concentrate densely at 2 km but can be up to 5 km. The results reveal that smoke released and lifted to heights ranging from 1000 to 2500 m has a higher proportion (~ 21%) of the total fire cases in Punjab that reach Delhi (below mixing layer depth) than other heights. This is the cause of the enhancement of the particulate matter pollution in Delhi during post-monsoon season. The forward trajectories indicate that central, west, south and south-east of Punjab including Barnala, Moga, Firozepur, south Patiala, south Sangrur, south Jalandhar, central Mansa, and south-east Mansa, have the highest quantities of Delhi-affecting trajectories with the maximum probability of 23% during the late burning period. The results help identify which burning hotspot areas of Punjab adversely affect Delhi’s air quality. This information is crucial for decision-makers in managing and controlling burning activity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerosol Optical Depth; Covid; Delhi; Extinction Coefficient; Punjab; Smoke Height; Aerosol; Calipso; Covid-19; Crop Residue; Modis; Optical Depth; Particulate Matter; Smoke; India","aerosol; CALIPSO; COVID-19; crop residue; MODIS; optical depth; particulate matter; smoke; India","","","The authors would like to show our great appreciation to Prof. Sachiko Hayashida (former Professor at Nara Women\u2019s University, Nara, Japan) and Assoc.

The study is situated within the broader context of industrialization and sustainable development in emerging economies. It employs structural decomposition analysis using Vietnam’s national input–output tables for the years 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2023. The analysis decomposes changes in total output into technical effects and final demand effects, allowing for an evaluation of the relative contributions of sectoral productivity and demand side factors. The findings of the study indicate that the manufacturing and services sectors have been the primary drivers of economic growth, with the electrical and optical equipment, food, beverages and tobacco, and basic metals sectors demonstrating particularly strong performance. The factor of final demand, which is derived from consumption, investment, and exports, has played a dominant role in driving output. Notably, export-led manufacturing has experienced significant benefits due to Vietnam’s engagement in free trade agreements. It is noteworthy that the agriculture sector demonstrated a period of recovery between 2019 and 2023, driven by an increase in final demand. This study underscores the pivotal function of sectoral adaptability, trade openness, and strategic policy in maintaining inclusive economic development. It is evident that the phenomenon under scrutiny is not only indicative of vulnerabilities and opportunities but also shaped by global shocks, for example, the coronavirus pandemic. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emerging Economies; I-o Analysis; Sectoral Growth; Structural Transformation","","","","","Abbott, Philip C., Trade and Development: Lessons from Vietnam's Past Trade Agreements, World Development, 37, 2, pp. 341-353, (2009); Almeida, Lucas Milanez de Lima, Application of multivariate analysis as complementary instrument in studies about structural changes: An example of the multipliers in the US economy, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 53, pp. 189-207, (2020); Barker, Tom, Vietnam: The next asian Tiger?, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 47, pp. 96-118, (2019); Dempster, Gregory M., Structural change in the U.S. economy: 1850-1900, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 31, pp. 112-123, (2014); Dhahri, Sabrine, Foreign capital towards SDGs 1 & 2—Ending Poverty and hunger: The role of agricultural production, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 53, pp. 208-221, (2020); Dietzenbacher, Erik, Structural decomposition techniques: Sense and sensitivity, Economic Systems Research, 10, 4, pp. 307-324, (1998); Doré, Natalia Izelli, The role of human capital, structural change, and institutional quality on Brazil's economic growth over the last two hundred years (1822–2019), Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 66, pp. 1-12, (2023); Erumban, Abdul Azeez, Structural change and economic growth in India, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 51, pp. 186-202, (2019); Franke, Reiner, Structural change in the manufacturing sector and its impact on business-related services: An input-output study for Germany, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 16, 4, pp. 467-488, (2005); Freire, Clovis, Economic diversification: A model of structural economic dynamics and endogenous technological change, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 49, pp. 13-28, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277099","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011734724"

This paper contributes to the limited evidence in middle-income countries by investigating this causal relationship in Vietnam. Methods We utilized a national survey on older persons for data analysis (N = 2,123). Since individuals' decisions to retire are potentially endogenous to their cognitive functioning due to omitted factors, we exploited the official retirement ages for men and women in Vietnam as an instrumental variable for the retirement decision. Results We found that retirement improved cognitive functioning. This effect was more pronounced in rural areas but appeared homogeneous across gender and types of occupation. Further investigations on mechanisms suggest that increased hours spent on self-care, social activity engagement, media usage, and sexual activity could be potential pathways through which retirement enhances cognitive functioning. Discussion Our findings suggest that activities or interventions aimed at promoting active aging, family solidarity, and community cohesion are crucial for maintaining and improving cognitive functioning in old age. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Health; Instrumental Variables; Middle-income Countries; Pension; Adult; Article; Cognition; Developed Country; Female; Healthy Aging; Human; Instrumental Variable Analysis; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Income Country; Pension; Retirement; Rural Area; Self Care; Sexual Behavior; Social Behavior; Solidarity; Very Elderly; Viet Nam; Aged; Aging; Epidemiology; Physiology; Psychology; Rural Population; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Aging; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retirement; Rural Population; Vietnam","adult; article; cognition; developed country; female; healthy aging; human; instrumental variable analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; middle income country; pension; retirement; rural area; self care; sexual behavior; social behavior; solidarity; very elderly; Viet Nam; aged; aging; epidemiology; physiology; psychology; rural population; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retirement; Rural Population; Vietnam","","","","Angrist, Joshua D., Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion, (2008); Long Term Care for Older People in Viet Nam the Current Scenario and Next Steps Toward A Healthy Aging Population, (2022); Atalay, Kadir, The effect of retirement on elderly cognitive functioning, Journal of Health Economics, 66, pp. 37-53, (2019); Banks, James, The Effect of Education on Old Age Cognitive Abilities: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design, Economic Journal, 122, 560, pp. 418-448, (2012); Bianchini, Laura, Retirement and memory in Europe, Ageing and Society, 36, 7, pp. 1434-1458, (2016); Bingley, Paul, Mental retirement and schooling, European Economic Review, 63, pp. 292-298, (2013); Bonsang, Éric, Does retirement affect cognitive functioning?, Journal of Health Economics, 31, 3, pp. 490-501, (2012); Celidoni, Martina, Retirement and cognitive decline.

Using Tram Chim National Park (TCNP) in Vietnam as a case study, it employs a mixed-method approach, including in-depth interviews with ten local conservation managers and semi-structured interviews with 30 community members. Research results have shown that since 2003, international conservation schemes have catalyzed reshaping Vietnam’s wetland management policies, enhancing community engagement and contributing to wetland conservation and sustainable utilization. The wetland management policies in Vietnam have transitioned from state-based to co-management involving local communities. However, these policy-level transformations have not effectively translated into practical co-management or Wise Use practices. The Resource Use Groups (RUGs), conceived as part of co-management, yielded only transient gains in augmenting community participation in TCNP wetland management. Tourism development as a manifestation of Wise Use practices has demonstrated only partial efficacy, as the beneficiaries of local tourism did not include impoverished individuals who relied on wetland resources. Despite the long-standing recognition of the role of local communities in wetland conservation due to international schemes and national policies, the execution of wetland management in the TCNP has remained entrenched in conservation without actively encouraging community participation in managing wetland resources. Based on these findings, this study concludes that without a fundamental shift in internal paradigms within the host country, international conservation endeavors can only generate transient co-management systems and incomplete Wise Use practices in developing countries such as Vietnam. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-management; Ramsar Convention; Resource User Groups; Vietnam; Wetland Management; Developing World; Local Participation; National Park; Ramsar Convention; Tourism Development; Wetland Management; Viet Nam","developing world; local participation; national park; Ramsar Convention; tourism development; wetland management; Viet Nam","","","We thank JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 22K01045 and the Research Grant for Encouragement of Students, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, for partly funding this study.

A combination of the emission model and financial model, along with secondary data, was adopted to simulate the environmental and economic impacts of three bus technologies (i.e. diesel buses, compressed natural gas buses, and electric buses). The environmental aspects were evaluated by setting the energy flow of CO<inf>2</inf> emission simulation, considering both direct and indirect emissions. The economic impacts of e-bus versus baseline diesel and CNG alternatives were estimated using the metric total cost of ownership (TCO) per km. We determined that although the mandatory e-bus program might represent a viable option when compared to the combustion alternatives from an environmental standpoint, e-buses are less appealing to bus companies due to their significantly lower cost-competitiveness under a traditional (current) business model. In contrast, a fleet leasing model brings large financial benefits to bus companies, increasing more probability of acceptability and intention of compliance from bus operators. Specifically, our analysis estimates that implementing the e-bus mandatory program with a new leasing model will result in a maximum of 47 %, 90, and 97 % emission removal in 2030, 2040, and 2050 respectively. In the same period, the TCO per km reduces a maximum of 41.8 %, 31.0 %, and 17.4 %, respectively, compared to the traditional business model.

Yet Japanese acceptance of medical AI, especially patient care, largely depends on the degree of ‘humanness’ that can be integrated into intelligent technologies. As empathy is considered a core value in the practice of healthcare workers, artificially intelligent agents must have the ability to perceive human emotions and respond in an affective, human-like manner. This paper presents the results of a nationwide survey in Japan 2023 about the public perception of the use of emotionalized AI (EAI) in healthcare. The sample included 2000 Japanese citizens from 20 to 69 years old with an average age of 45 years. The questionnaire included 65 items in six categories: demographic, perception of the existing healthcare system, attitude towards the use of AI, and EAI in healthcare, trust and privacy concerns and fear of AI, and seeking literacy on new technologies. The analysis of the responses demonstrates that overall, the Japanese population has a limited knowledge of AI, EAI, and smart technologies but trusts the healthcare system, physicians, and staff to use it properly, with little worries over the potential pitfalls related to data security and safety. However, they prefer the use of more human resources and are concerned about privacy and the high cost of new technology, and believe little information is being provided to them through government and media. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai; Ai Acceptance; Chatbot; Companion Ai; Emotion; Emotional Ai; Empathic Surveillance; Healthcare; Japan; Robots; Technology; Medical Robotics; Robots; Artificial Intelligence Acceptance; Chatbots; Companion Artificial Intelligence; Emotion; Emotional Artificial Intelligence; Empathic Surveillance; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Japan; Technology","Medical robotics; Robots; Artificial intelligence acceptance; Chatbots; Companion artificial intelligence; Emotion; Emotional artificial intelligence; Empathic surveillance; Healthcare; Healthcare systems; Japan; Technology","","","This work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Award FA2386-23-1-4065.","Abdollahi, Hojjat, Artificial Emotional Intelligence in Socially Assistive Robots for Older Adults: A Pilot Study, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 14, 3, pp. 2020-2032, (2023); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Aung, Myo Nyein, Digitally Inclusive, Healthy Aging Communities (DIHAC): A Cross-Cultural Study in Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Thailand, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 12, (2022); Bagheri, Elahe, An autonomous cognitive empathy model responsive to users' facial emotion expressions, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 10, 3, (2020); Bagheri, Elahe, A Reinforcement Learning Based Cognitive Empathy Framework for Social Robots, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 5, pp. 1079-1093, (2021); Barrot, Jessie S., Using ChatGPT for second language writing: Pitfalls and potentials, Assessing Writing, 57, (2023); Béchade, Lucile, Towards metrics of evaluation of pepper robot as a social companion for the elderly, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 510, pp. 89-101, (2019); Beets, Becca, Surveying Public Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care in the United States: Systematic Review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 25, (2023); Berube, Caterina, Voice-based conversational agents for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions: Systematic literature review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 23, 3, (2021); Beyer-Wunsch, Pia, Effects of a humanoid robot on the well-being for hospitalized children in the pediatric clinic - An experimental study, Procedia Computer Science, 176, pp. 2077-2087, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09515666; 14355655","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209194835"

Therefore, identifying a cost-effective feeding mode can help farmers cope with this problem. This study compared the effects of two popular feeding modes, commercial feed and combination feed (mixing instant feed with agricultural byproducts), on the technical efficiency (TE) of small pig holders in Vietnam. The data envelopment analysis approach and meta-frontier were used to measure and compare the TE of commercial and combination feeds. Additionally, this study used a Tobit regression to analyze the factors affecting TE. TE was 75.06, 86.56, and 78.76% with the meta-frontier, commercial, and combination feeding group frontiers, respectively. The corresponding meta-technology ratios of these groups were 83.89 and 97.24%, respectively, indicating that the TE of the combined feeding mode is higher than that of the commercial feeding mode. This finding confirms the economics of combination feed in the context of increasing the import price of raw materials for feed production. The results of the Tobit models show that the education of household heads, access to credit, pig density, family income, herd size, and percentage of own-produced piglets are determinants of TE. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Envelopment Analysis; Feeding Mode; Meta Frontier; Pig Production; Technical Efficiency; Feeding Behavior; Instrumentation; Pig; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Technical Efficiency; Hanoi; Viet Nam","feeding behavior; instrumentation; pig; spatiotemporal analysis; technical efficiency; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.01-2021.47.

This paper aims to conduct a rational statistical approach to evaluate the current situation of surface water quality in the Mekong Delta, applying Factor Analysis (FA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) to a database of 3117 samples collected by national and provincial monitoring stations. The results revealed significant contamination with organic pollutants (BOD5: 3.50–172.870 mg/L, COD: 6.493–472.984 mg/L), pesticides (e.g., DDTs: n.d to 1.227 mg/L), trace metals (As: 0.006–0.046 mg/L, Cr: n.d–1.960 mg/L), and microbial indicators (Coliforms: n.d–45,100 MPN/100 mL), often higher than the WHO drinking water threshold. PCA/AHC analysis identified the following five major pollution components: (1) organic pollution and sewage/industrial and deposited chemicals (PCA1—23.08% variance); (2) pesticide and agricultural runoff derived contamination with Hg (PCA2—15.44%); (3) microbial pollution of the water was found to correlate positively with Zn and Cu content (PCA3—8.90%); (4) salinity was found to mobilize As and Cr (PCA4—8.00%); (5) nutrient/microbial pollution presumably from agricultural and sewage inputs (PCA5—7.22%). AHC showed some spatial variability that grouped samples in urban/industrial (Cluster 1), rural/agricultural (Cluster 2), and a highly contaminated one, where water was toxic and presented with microbial and Cd contamination (Cluster 3). Levels of pesticides, Cr, and microbial pollution were higher than reported in previous Mekong Delta studies and exceeded regional trends. These results emphasize the importance of holistic water management strategies, including better wastewater treatment, pesticide control, sustainable farming, and climate-adaptive measures to reduce saltwater intrusion and safeguard drinking water quality for the Mekong Delta. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering; Factor Analysis; Mekong Delta; Principal Component Analysis; Water Quality; Agricultural Runoff; Drinking Water; Pesticide; Salinity; Surface Water; Water Management; Water Quality; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","agricultural runoff; drinking water; pesticide; salinity; surface water; water management; water quality; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Vietnam, through two projects: \u201CStudy on the Mechanism of Transport, Accumulation, and Dispersion of Pollutants in Coastal Waters from Vung Tau to Kien Giang\u201D (Project Code: \u0110T\u0110L.CN-57/21), and \u201CStudy on the Development of Characteristic Lines of Meteoric, Surface, and Groundwater to Determine the Contribution Ratio of Upstream Water Sources to the Mekong Delta\u201D (Project Code: \u0110T\u0110L.CN-54/22).

Yet, this heritage is rapidly declining: from over 240 structures in 2000, fewer than 100 remain today. This study introduces a heritage-based evaluation framework to assess and preserve French colonial buildings using Le Loi Street, Hue’s historic “Western quarter” as a pilot site. Fourteen colonial-era buildings were systematically assessed through field surveys and expert consultation. A total of 40 specialists participated in the criteria development process, and eight selected experts conducted detailed building evaluations. The final framework includes three main categories and nine specific criteria, based on a 100-point scale, incorporating architectural integrity, historical and cultural significance, contextual fit, and adaptive reuse potential. The results show that all the surveyed buildings qualify as Group A or B, warranting strict conservation or minimal renovation. The study emphasizes the value of localized, expert-informed approaches to heritage planning.

Cheapfakes can be produced easily and spread quickly; a common type is out-of-context misinformation. It is worth investigating a proper algorithm that can efficiently detect such types of misinformation. In this work, we study a new approach to the detection problem of cheapfakes by using graphical neural networks to detect out-of-context samples using the dataset from the ICME 23 Grand Challenge on Detecting Cheapfakes. Specifically, our model utilizes scene graph matching and a language model pre-trained for the natural language inference task to solve task 1 of the challenge. We also propose effective methods to generate labeled data from an unlabeled training set of the challenge. Our proposed method achieved an F1 score of 85.69% and an accuracy score of 85.50% on the public testing set, surpassing the baseline by 4.69% and 3.60%, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cheapfakes; Graph Embedding; Misinformation; Scene Graphs","","","","","Aneja, Shivangi, COSMOS: Catching Out-of-Context Image Misuse with Self-Supervised Learning, 37, pp. 14084-14092, (2023); Wang, Sijin, Cross-modal scene graph matching for relationship-aware image-text retrieval, pp. 1497-1506, (2020); Nguyen, Manh Duy, A Deep Local and Global Scene-Graph Matching for Image-Text Retrieval, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, 337, pp. 510-523, (2021); Johnson, Justin, Image retrieval using scene graphs, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 07-12-June-2015, pp. 3668-3678, (2015); Wang, Yulu, Hi-SIGIR: Hierachical Semantic-Guided Image-to-image Retrieval via Scene Graph, pp. 6400-6409, (2023); Papadopoulos, Stefanos Iordanis, VERITE: a Robust benchmark for multimodal misinformation detection accounting for unimodal bias, International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 13, 1, (2024); Pham, Kha Luan, Ookpik- A Collection of Out-of-Context Image-Caption Pairs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 14557 LNCS, pp. 132-144, (2024); Tufchi, Shivani, A comprehensive survey of multimodal fake news detection techniques: advances, challenges, and opportunities, International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 12, 2, (2023); Proceedings of the 12th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, (2021); La, Tuanvinh, Leverage Boosting and Transformer on Text-Image Matching for Cheap Fakes Detection †, Algorithms, 15, 11, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","2192662X; 21926611","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005224518"

To address the potential endogeneity of IPV, we employed the mother-in-law’s IPV history as an instrumental variable (IV) and analyzed data from the National Survey on Domestic Violence against Women in Vietnam. We found that a one standard deviation increase in the IPV index was associated with a significant increase in the use of medication (36.1%) and outpatient visits (37.4%). Further analysis showed that these effects varied based on women’s and their husbands’ education, place of residence, and ethnicity. Mechanism analysis showed that IPV negatively impacted women’ health, potentially leading to increased healthcare utilization. These findings highlight the detrimental consequences of IPV on women’s health and healthcare utilization in the Vietnamese context, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions that address the diverse experiences of women and the social factors influencing healthcare access in the face of IPV. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestic Violence; Health; Healthcare Utilization; Instrumental Variable; Intimate Partner Violence; Vietnam","","","","","undefined, (2013); Bhattacharya, Haimanti, Spousal Violence and Women's Employment in India, Feminist Economics, 21, 2, pp. 30-52, (2015); Bonomi, Amy E., Health care utilization and costs associated with physical and nonphysical-only intimate partner violence, Health Services Research, 44, 3, pp. 1052-1067, (2009); Bound, John, The dynamic effects of health on the labor force transitions of older workers, Labour Economics, 6, 2, pp. 179-202, (1999); Bui, Quang Nhat, The effect of domestic violence against women on child welfare in Vietnam, Children and Youth Services Review, 94, pp. 709-719, (2018); Chen, Lu, The hidden cost of informal care: An empirical study on female caregivers’ subjective well-being, Social Science and Medicine, 224, pp. 85-93, (2019); Coll, Carolina De Vargas Nunes, Intimate partner violence in 46 low-income and middle-income countries: An appraisal of the most vulnerable groups of women using national health surveys, BMJ Global Health, 5, 1, (2020); Dang, Truc Ngoc Hoang, Socioeconomic Inequalities in Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence from Vietnam, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 40, 1-2, pp. 31-55, (2025); Estimation and Inference in Econometrics, (1993); Devries, Karen M., Violence against women is strongly associated with suicide attempts: Evidence from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women, Social Science and Medicine, 73, 1, pp. 79-86, (2011)","","Springer","","","","","","15737152; 15695239","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003941165"

However, studies of personhood and childhood in archaeological hunter-gatherer (or forager) contexts remain limited, particularly for Southeast Asia. Here, we explore aspects of personhood and the lived experiences of preadults at Con Co Ngua, an early seventh millennium BP sedentary hunter-gatherer community in northern Vietnam. We approach this analysis by way of our knowledge of skeletal representation, grave construction, body positioning, corpse manipulation (including extensive mutilation of certain individuals), and the integration of previous research into lifeways and environment. The results of our analyses provide support for a degree of differential preadult mortuary treatment, primarily manifested through body treatment and positioning. However, interpretations of these treatments are complicated by the highly fragmented and disaggregated nature of the majority of preadult burials. We contend that the comparatively more dispersed and fragmentary nature of the preadult burials at the site is caused by intentional human action at the site, rather than differential preservation or recovery biases, and such apparent biases may actually stem from deliberate human intervention. That is, socially appropriate mortuary treatments regarding constructions of personhood, social memory, or collective identity may have led to the dispersal of preadults throughout the mortuary contexts of the site. More broadly, the mortuary evidence from Con Co Ngua supports the conclusion that all of those buried at Con Co Ngua were bestowed some degree of personhood by their community, as demonstrated through the inclusion of all in the cemetery, from foetuses to elderly adults. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Childhood; Hunter-gatherer; Mortuary Archaeology; Personhood; Vietnam","","","","Many thanks to Professor Lynley Wallis for taking hundreds of photographs during the 2015 post-excavation season in Hanoi.

Moreover, existing linear economy has also worsened status of plastic pollution. Thus, controlling plastic pollution and transitioning from linear economy to circular economy are becoming urgent. Municipal solid waste management plays a fundamental role in plastic pollution control and transition to circular economy. This study aimed at understanding status of plastic leakage and clarifying reversed logistic system in Danang city, Vietnam. The waste flow diagram (WFD) and material flow analysis (MFA) based on principle of mass balance were applied in this study. Yearly unmanaged plastic waste was estimated at 2198 tonnes. The amount of plastic waste leaked into aquatic environment was estimated at 0.99 kg/cap/year. Majority of unmanaged plastic waste mainly originated from uncollected waste (78.05% of total unmanaged plastic waste) and collection service (21.36% of total unmanaged plastic waste). Regarding informal reversed logistic system, itinerant buyers and waste pickers considerably contributed to recyclable waste recovery, collecting with about 69.34 tonnes (79.32% of total recovered recyclable waste) of recyclable material on a daily basis. Despite potential for circulation, other types of recyclable waste — glass, textile and leather, wood, as well as rubber — have not been widely collected for recovery. Results of this study offer scientific base for managers, policymakers, decision makers and related stakeholders of solid waste management system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular Economy; Informal Sector; Material Flow Analysis (mfa); Vietnam; Waste Flow Diagram (wfd); Bioremediation; Energy Conservation; Land Fill; Plastic Recycling; Wood Wastes; Circular Economy; Informal Sector; Material Flow Analyze; Materials Flow Analysis; Plastic Pollutions; Plastics Waste; Recyclable Wastes; Viet Nam; Waste Flow Diagram; Waste Flow Diagrams; Municipal Solid Waste","Bioremediation; Energy conservation; Land fill; Plastic recycling; Wood wastes; Circular economy; Informal sector; Material flow analyze; Materials flow analysis; Plastic pollutions; Plastics waste; Recyclable wastes; Viet Nam; Waste flow diagram; Waste flow diagrams; Municipal solid waste","","","The authors would like to be grateful to Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) for offering scholarship to first author.

Two-stage least squares regressions show that a one standard deviation increase in the IPV index led to a 0.378-point increase in the child behavioral problem score. The effect was mainly driven by children living in rural areas and less wealthy households.

The rise of IoT has expanded the cyber attack surface, making traditional centralized machine learning methods insufficient due to concerns about data availability, computational resources, transfer costs, and especially privacy preservation. A semi-supervised federated learning model was developed to overcome these issues, combining the Shrink Autoencoder and Centroid one-class classifier (SAE-CEN). This approach enhances the performance of intrusion detection by effectively representing normal network data and accurately identifying anomalies in the decentralized strategy. Additionally, a mean square error-based aggregation algorithm (MSEAvg) was introduced to improve global model performance by prioritizing more accurate local models. The results obtained in our experimental setup, which uses various settings relying on the N-BaIoT dataset and Dirichlet distribution, demonstrate significant improvements in real-world heterogeneous IoT networks in detection accuracy from 93.98 ± 2.90 to 97.30 ± 0.49, reduced learning costs when requiring only 50% of gateways participating in the training process, and robustness in large-scale networks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Federated Learning; Internet Of Things; Intrusion Detection System; Machine Learning; Adversarial Machine Learning; Network Intrusion; Self-supervised Learning; Centralised; Computational Resources; Cyber-attacks; Data Availability; Intrusion Detection Systems; Learning Approach; Machine Learning Methods; Machine-learning; Network Intrusion Detection; Semi-supervised; Federated Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Network intrusion; Self-supervised learning; Centralised; Computational resources; Cyber-attacks; Data availability; Intrusion Detection Systems; Learning approach; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Network intrusion detection; Semi-supervised; Federated learning","","","","AbdulRahman, Sawsan, A survey on federated learning: The journey from centralized to distributed on-site learning and beyond, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 7, pp. 5476-5497, (2021); Breunig, Markus M., LOF: Identifying density-based local outliers, SIGMOD Record, 29, 2, pp. 93-104, (2000); Cao, Van Loi, A hybrid autoencoder and density estimation model for anomaly detection, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9921 LNCS, pp. 717-726, (2016); Cao, Van Loi, Learning Neural Representations for Network Anomaly Detection, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 8, pp. 3074-3087, (2019); Chandola, Varun, Anomaly detection: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 41, 3, (2009); Derawi, Mohammad Omar, Internet-of-Things-Based Smart Transportation Systems for Safer Roads, (2020); Deep Learning, (2015); Guendouzi, Souhila Badra, A systematic review of federated learning: Challenges, aggregation methods, and development tools, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 220, (2023); Jimenez-Gutierrez, Daniel Mauricio, FedArtML: A Tool to Facilitate the Generation of Non-IID Datasets in a Controlled Way to Support Federated Learning Research, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 81004-81016, (2024); Huang, Jin, Using AUC and accuracy in evaluating learning algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 3, pp. 299-310, (2005)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01674048","","CPSED","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216459406"

This study proposes an innovative methodology to enhance evacuation shelter suitability in response to geo-hydrological hazard scenarios, focusing on vulnerable regions like India's Western Ghats. Our approach integrates susceptibility assessments for floods and landslides, employing Variable Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to ensure predictor variable independence. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) augmented with an attention mechanism and refined through Bayesian optimization, our model accurately predicts landslide and flood susceptibility, facilitating robust evacuation planning. Additionally, our methodology incorporates constraint factors and a Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) to address multi-hazard scenarios, providing a comprehensive framework for emergency response strategies. Implemented in the complex terrain of the Western Ghats, our model demonstrates exceptional accuracy metrics, with optimized CNN models achieving over 91 % accuracy, precision, and recognition rate. Evacuation zone mapping identifies highly suitable areas (18 %), unsuitable areas (47 %), and moderate to low suitability zones (14 % and 21 % respectively), offering valuable insights for resilience-building efforts in hazard-prone regions. This integrative approach not only precisely identifies hazard-prone areas, but also provides a robust framework for refining emergency response strategies, contributing to sustainable development and resilience in vulnerable environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn; Emergency Response; Evacuation Shelter; Flood And Landslide; Multi-hazard; Western Ghats","","","","The study received funding through the Junior Research Fellowship from the University Grants Commission (India) (UGC-Ref.

Grasping the root causes of this behavior is crucial for implementing effective interventions amid escalating flood risks. While existing literature offers insights into evacuation decisions for various hazards, it overlooks key motivations and barriers specific to flood evacuation in rural Vietnam. This study endeavors to bridge this gap by investigating the factors influencing rural households' evacuation decisions in response to the significant 2020 floods in Central Vietnam. Data for analysis were gathered through in-person interviews with 407 households across Phong Dien, Quang Dien, and Huong Tra districts of Thua Thien Hue Province. The logistic regression model results disproved the influence of variables associated with sociodemographic characteristics, hazard proximity, and flood risk experience. The findings, meanwhile, underscore the impact of those related to threat appraisal, coping appraisal, trust in external support, and perceived evacuation barriers. Proper assessment of flood threats has emerged as a critical factor in promoting evacuation, whereas overconfidence in one's coping capacity and the overestimation of external support adversely affect evacuation decisions. Concerns about potential property loss further hinder evacuation motivation. The proposed interventions encompass prioritizing educational campaigns to clarify flood risk dynamics, categorizing household structure resilience against floods, highlighting challenges associated with self-evacuation, mitigating reliance on external support, enhancing living conditions in evacuation sites, and implementing security measures during flood seasons. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Evacuation Behavior; Evacuation Decisions; Flood Evacuation; Flood Risk; Natural Disasters","","","","This work was partially supported by the University of Economics, Hue University (Grant No. NNC.\u0110HKT.2023.05).","Human Cost of Disasters an Overview of the Last 20 Years 2000 2019, (2020); Climate Change 2013 the Physical Science Basis, (2025); State of the Global Climate 2020, (2021); Global Climate Risk Index 2021, (2021); People in Harms Way Flood Exposure and Poverty in 189 Countries, (2020); Ha, Vo Hoang, Post-flood recovery in the central coastal plain of Vietnam: determinants and policy implications, Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science, 6, 3, pp. 899-929, (2022); Dinh, Nguyen Cong, Long-Term Improvement in Precautions for Flood Risk Mitigation: A Case Study in the Low-Lying Area of Central Vietnam, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 12, 2, pp. 250-266, (2021); Dinh, Nguyen Cong, How do social connections accelerate post-flood recovery?

Since 2012, the GG initiatives have focused on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and enhancing energy efficiency by promoting a shift from private to public transport. The transport equity impacts of these initiatives are studied and quantified using comprehensive data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) between 2014 and 2020. To explore horizontal and vertical equity, we developed a transit service index to measure changes in the implementation of GG initiatives and employed the Entropy weighting analysis (EWA) method, cluster analyses alongside the Lorenz curves, and the Gini index. The spatial distribution of transport equity changes is mapped to illustrate regional variations in response to GG initiatives. Results are presented through Lorenz curves, showcasing improvements in horizontal transport equity across Vietnam's regions, while vertical equity among provinces is assessed using the Gini index. The study contributes in practice by providing evidence to policymakers for a better understanding of the GG initiatives’ impacts. Finally, the study proposes several implications for policymakers to create efficient GG measures to retain transport equity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entropy Weighting Analysis; Green Growth; Transit Service Index; Transport Equity","","","","This work was supported by the VinUni (Digital Twin Platform for Green and Sustainable Management of Transportation [Digital Twin for Green Transportation] VUNI.GT .NTKH.09) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23\u202FK04063).","Abid, Nabila, Green growth and sustainable development: dynamic linkage between technological innovation, ISO 14001, and environmental challenges, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 17, pp. 25428-25447, (2022); Bandegani, Milad, Evaluation of horizontal equity under a distance-based transit fare structure, Journal of Public Transportation, 19, 3, pp. 161-172, (2016); Bø, Eirill, Use of GPS-data to improve transport solutions in a cost and environmental perspective, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives, 13, (2022); Browne, David, Comparative analysis of evaluation techniques for transport policies, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 31, 3, pp. 226-233, (2011); Cao, Yaru, Impact of environmental regulation on green growth in China’s manufacturing industry–based on the Malmquist-Luenberger index and the system GMM model, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 33, pp. 41928-41945, (2020); Carleton, Phillip R., A comparative analysis of the challenges in measuring transit equity: definitions, interpretations, and limitations, Journal of Transport Geography, 72, pp. 64-75, (2018); Chen, Zhenhua, Impact of high-speed rail on regional economic disparity in China, Journal of Transport Geography, 65, pp. 80-91, (2017); Delbosc, Alexa Reynolds, Using Lorenz curves to assess public transport equity, Journal of Transport Geography, 19, 6, pp. 1252-1259, (2011); undefined, (2005); undefined, (1912)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","25901982","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217227068"

We use Zimbabwe’s 1980 expansion of secondary education as a natural experiment to explore its effects on various aspects of women’s empowerment, such as reproductive self-determination, household decision-making power, and attitudes towards and experiences of domestic violence. Results indicate that women affected by the reform received an average of 2.73 additional years of education compared to their peers. The impact is particularly significant for women in rural areas and those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. One additional year of education resulted in a 0.43-year delay in first cohabitation, a 0.26-year delay in first birth, a 5 percentage point increase in household purchase decision-making, and a 1.2 percentage point increase in decision-making power regarding contraceptive use. Furthermore, there was a 4.1 percentage point decrease in agreement on beating by a partner is justified for any reason, a 3.7 percentage point reduction in agreement on beating is justified if a woman refuses to have sex with her partner, and a 0.6-percentage point decrease in the probability of experiencing unwanted sexual intercourse. The study remains robust through various checks. The mechanism is elucidated, demonstrating that secondary education reform significantly promoted women’s empowerment through improved access to information, assortative matching, and labor market involvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal Analysis; Demographic Health Survey; Secondary Education; Women’s Empowerment; Zimbabwe; Domestic Violence; Education Reform; Empowerment; Health Survey; Secondary Education; Womens Status; Zimbabwe","domestic violence; education reform; empowerment; health survey; secondary education; womens status; Zimbabwe","","","We acknowledge the financial support that we received from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up (Grant No. 23K18795).","Acosta, Mariola, What does it Mean to Make a ‘Joint’ Decision?

Although low-quality fertilizer is often reported in the global south, little is said about how to solve the problem. Purpose: We examine how the government, fertilizer manufacturers and dealers, and farmers have dealt with fertilizer quality in Vietnam. We evaluate the quality of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) fertilizer samples in the Mekong Delta, a hub of rice production. Approach and methods: We conducted in-depth interviews and discussions with stakeholders to understand the mechanisms for ensuring fertilizer quality and their effectiveness. It became clear that concerns about fertilizer quality were not regarding products from large state enterprises that dominate the market, but rather about fertilizer from smaller, often newer, manufacturers. We collected 141 samples of NPK fertilizers from smaller manufacturers in the Mekong Delta to compare the measured levels of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potassium (K) with their declared levels. Findings: Three complementary strategies for ensuring fertilizer quality have been identified: (1) government regulation and oversight through licensing, mandatory quality labelling, and random inspections; (2) manufacturer initiatives to establish brand reputation through warranties and dealer certification; and (3) farmer observations of fertilizer effectiveness that are communicated back to local dealers. The overall quality of fertilizers in the market was notably high, with the main brands from state enterprises capturing 95% of the market share. However, concerns were raised regarding the quality of lesser-known fertilizer brands from newer manufacturers. Analysis of 141 fertilizer samples revealed that 48.9% of the minor-brand fertilizers were lacking in at least one nutrient, exceeding the legally allowed deviation of 10%. Samples usually had excessive nitrogen and insufficient potassium. Policy implications: These findings highlight the necessity of coordinated government and market efforts to ensure fertilizer quality. Government regulation alone may not eliminate substandard fertilizer from the market, but it can be effective when combined with market initiatives from fertilizer manufacturers, dealers, and farmers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Experience Goods; Low-quality Fertilizer; Vietnam; Crop Yield; Fertilizer; Market Conditions; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; State Role; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","crop yield; fertilizer; market conditions; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; state role; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","This research is financially supported by IDE\u2010JETRO [2018_2_40_016], JSPS KAKENHI [18H00844], and the Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University.","Ariga, Joshua, Can improved agricultural technologies spur a green revolution in Africa?

To achieve an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable energy transition in the region, it is vital to utilize all available renewable energy sources to the greatest extent possible. It is therefore essential to gain an understanding of how citizens in each country perceive the available renewables. However, the majority of existing literature in this region has been constrained by a narrow focus on a comparison between fossil and renewable energy. Furthermore, while previous research has predominantly concentrated on single-country analyses, there are significant implications that could be disseminated across ASEAN countries. In light of the aforementioned limitations of existing literature, this paper aims to make a contribution by undertaking a comparative analysis of public preferences for renewable energy sources in eight major urban areas in seven Southeast Asian countries. The findings of this study indicate that, while climate change (or global warming) is perceived as a significant issue, it is often regarded as a secondary concern compared to other environmental issues. This is despite the fact that many of these issues are closely interlinked with and would be exacerbated by climate change. Furthermore, the findings suggest that solar energy is the most preferred renewable source across all urban areas surveyed. In contrast, bioenergy (or biomass) is generally the least preferred source of energy in all cities. There is considerable variation in perceptions of wind, hydro, and geothermal energy, with a high degree of variability between and within countries. These similarities and differences in preferences for renewable energy sources appear to be associated with varying levels of knowledge or familiarity with each source, which is consistent with differing willingness to pay for each source. These findings highlight the necessity for policies that address this apparent lack of understanding of how the transition to a sustainable energy system and each renewable energy technology can help mitigate the impact of environmental problems highlighted in each society. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asean; Biomass; Geothermal; Hydropower; Public Preferences; Renewable Energy; Solar; Willingness To Pay; Wind","","","","Funding text 1: Open Access funding provided by The University of Tokyo.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).

Therefore, this study uses panel data collected through three survey rounds in June and September 2020 and January 2021 to analyze changes in household food expenditure and consumption behaviors and to investigate the association between household characteristics and food insecurity. The results show that households with diverse income sources, including multiple farm products, non-farm businesses, and remittances from absent members, are less likely to reduce food consumption quality and quantity, and be in the lower tail of food expenditure distribution. -However, households in the upper tail of the food expenditure distribution aggressively stock up on food in the second quarter of the year, fearing that lockdown measures would interrupt the food supply. These households tend to have an urban way of living characterized by salaried jobs, small family size, high educational attainment, and proximity to the capital city. The levels of food expenditure remain high even after the lifting of lockdown and movement restrictions, and the reason might be possible uncertainty about crop harvests, despite the eventual good harvests in the year. Overall, these findings suggest that diversification of income sources for rural households in developing countries can help households cope with disruptions to food production and supply chains. The findings also suggest that policies to ensure food access during the pandemic should target households with limited income sources and those in the lower tail of the food expenditure distribution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Food Insecurity; Panel Data; Panic Buying; Rural Bangladesh; Covid-19; Food Consumption; Food Production; Food Security; Panel Data; Rural Area; Supply Chain Management; Bangladesh","COVID-19; food consumption; food production; food security; panel data; rural area; supply chain management; Bangladesh","","","","Ahmed, Firoz, Determinants and dynamics of food insecurity during COVID-19 in rural Bangladesh, Food Policy, 101, (2021); Alam, GM Monirul, Impact of COVID-19 on vegetable supply chain and food security: Empirical evidence from Bangladesh, PLOS ONE, 16, 3 March 2021, (2021); Alston, Margaret M., Are climate challenges reinforcing child and forced marriage and dowry as adaptation strategies in the context of Bangladesh?, Women's Studies International Forum, 47, PA, pp. 137-144, (2014); Andress, Lauri, Juggling the five dimensions of food access: Perceptions of rural low income residents, Appetite, 105, pp. 151-155, (2016); Barrett, Christopher B., Measuring food insecurity, Science, 327, 5967, pp. 825-828, (2010); Labor Migration in Asia Impacts of the Covid 19 Crisis and the Post Pandemic Future, (2021); Bentall, Richard P., Pandemic buying: Testing a psychological model of over-purchasing and panic buying using data from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, PLOS ONE, 16, 1 January, (2021); South Asian Survey, (2021); Dercon, Stefan, Rural poverty: Old challenges in new contexts, World Bank Research Observer, 24, 1, pp. 1-28, (2009); Devereux, Stephen, Conceptualising COVID-19’s impacts on household food security, Food Security, 12, 4, pp. 769-772, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18764525; 18764517","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212387383"

This study employs an economy-wide material flow analysis to assess the ASEAN community's material use, waste generation, emissions, resource efficiency, and circularity rate. The analysis encompasses the entire ASEAN economy, with a detailed focus on four member countries: Thailand, Laos, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In 2018, ASEAN countries collectively extracted 6449 million metric tons (Mt) of resources, exported 1302 Mt, and recorded a domestic material consumption (DMC) of 6376 Mt. Approximately 40% of this DMC contributed to material stock accumulation. Of the domestic processed output, 58% was released as air emissions, and the end-of-life recycling rate was 1.3%. Resource efficiency trends from 1970 to 2021 reveal a general improvement across the region, although Laos and Vietnam exhibited lower efficiency levels than the ASEAN average. The study concludes by comparing the sustainability policy capacities of the four selected countries with their material flows, identifying key areas requiring policy intervention and improvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular Economy; Environmental And Sustainability Policy; Industrial Ecology; Material Flow Analysis; Sustainable Materials Management; Waste And Emissions; Sustainable Development Goals; Association Of Southeast Asian Nations; Circular Economy; Environmental Policy; Industrial Ecology; Materials Flow Analysis; Materials Management; Sustainability Policy; Sustainable Material Management; Sustainable Materials; Wastes And Emissions; Asean; Circular Economy; Environmental Policy; Industrial Ecology; Material Flow Analysis; Recycling; Resource Allocation; Sustainability; Waste Management; Laos; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","Sustainable development goals; Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Circular economy; Environmental policy; Industrial ecology; Materials flow analysis; Materials management; Sustainability policy; Sustainable material management; Sustainable materials; Wastes and emissions; ASEAN; circular economy; environmental policy; industrial ecology; material flow analysis; recycling; resource allocation; sustainability; waste management; Laos; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the ongoing collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme International Resource Panel and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.; Funding text 2: International support has played a crucial role in advancing Laos's sustainability efforts, with initiatives such as SWITCH\u2010Asia, funded by the European Union (Switch Asia, 2022 ).

However, the adoption of organic fertilizers among farming households has been slow, spontaneous, and fragmented. The absence of credible information and advisory sources is reported to be a critical constraint. The sharing of information and experiences among social networks is expected to play an important role in overcoming this constraint, although strong causal evidence remains scarce. Therefore, this study employs an instrumental variable approach with observational village-census data to identify the causal impacts of social networks on the adoption of organic fertilizers and explores the underlying information-sharing mechanism within social networks, providing rich information about existing social networks for both men and women separately. The estimation results show that in farming households, the wife's social networks have a positive and significant effect on the diffusion of organic fertilizers.

With observational data from 1383 surveyed households, we use an estimation strategy combining inverse probability weighting, regression adjustment, and two-stage least squares to address selection bias and omitted variable bias in two variables of interest. We find that while these two interventions are individually effective in alleviating poverty, their combination is not necessarily as effective. Our results show that commercialisation only reduces poverty among non-supported households, while government supports are more effective among non-commercial households. This substitution of effects comes from the nature of support targeting and commercialisation. Households receiving supports often have lower capacity, making commercialisation ineffective or even impossible. Furthermore, current support policies are insufficient to enhance the impact of commercialisation. These results suggest that there could be more effective ways to combine external interventions and self-help efforts to better alleviate poverty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-poverty Policy; Commercialisation; Multidimensional Poverty; Commercial Activity; Decision Making; Poverty Alleviation; State Role; Viet Nam","commercial activity; decision making; poverty alleviation; state role; Viet Nam","","","We would like to thank Anne Stenger (France\u2019s National Research Institute for Agri- culture, Food and Environment) and Phu Nguyen-Van (University of Paris Nanterre) for their comments during the Sustainability, Public Action, and Well-Being Workshop (2022).

However, the ways in which to quantify the degree of landscape change to guide spatial management have remained underexplored. Taking rapidly changing Hàng Buồm Street, Hanoi, Vietnam, as case study, we developed a numerical score for HULs to capture change tendencies. From onsite surveys, we defined the intensity and speed of change in trade and façades and identified vulnerable spots by mapping the scores for 131 units in 2015, 2017, and 2019. Our results showed that superficial façade changes happened regardless of the degree of trade change, and that the intense façade and trade changes happened around junctions with heavily touristified streets. We also found that aside from conventional tourism, newly emerging nighttime economies, wellness tourism, and multifunctional complexes had more intense façade changes. Based on these findings, we propose refining current management strategies by preparing stricter guidelines to control the aforementioned highly influential trades, establishing urban design project for old street to improve management of junctions especially with heavily touristified streets, and providing detailed examples of appropriate signboards that can easily be referenced by merchants and investors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian Historic Urban Landscape; Change Management; Commercial District; Score; Facades; Investments; Tourism; Asian Historic Urban Landscape; Change Management; Commercial District; Dynamic Changes; Exposed To; Landscape Changes; Score; Spatial Management; Urban Landscape; Viet Nam; Urban Planning","Facades; Investments; Tourism; Asian historic urban landscape; Change management; Commercial district; Dynamic changes; Exposed to; Landscape changes; Score; Spatial management; Urban landscape; Viet Nam; Urban planning","","","This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, under the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [19K15164].","Doctoral Dissertation Submitted to the Graduate School of Science and Engineering, (2015); Bandarin, Francesco, The Historic Urban Landscape: Managing Heritage in an Urban Century, (2012); Ci to Xay Dng Mi Trong Ph C Ha Ni Renovation New Construction in the Ancient Quarter of Hanoi, (2014); Inventaire Des Metiers Par Ligne De Rue Action 1 Maintenir Les Metiers Traditionnels Bureau De Gestion Du Quartier Ancien Hanoi 2004 2005, (2005); 36 Guild Streets Area Hanois Haq Historic Center of the Citys Prosperity, (2008); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2015); Dillette, Alana K., Dimensions of holistic wellness as a result of international wellness tourism experiences, Current Issues in Tourism, 24, 6, pp. 794-810, (2021); Conservation of Historic Buildings, (1982); Showa Women S University Institute of International Culture Bulletin, (2010); American Journal of Sociology, (1955)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13472852; 13467581","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209068095"

Our PSM estimation showed that experiencing elder abuse significantly increased depressive symptom index by 0.331 points. This result remained robust across multiple sensitivity checks. Heterogeneity analysis further showed that the impact of elder abuse was more pronounced among older women and individuals with lower education, highlighting the intersection of gender-based violence and socioeconomic disparities in the experience of elder abuse.

A meaning-recall vocabulary levels test and a reading comprehension test were administered to 304 tertiary-level Vietnamese learners of English.

Utilizing panel data regression models and SPSS 26 software, the findings reveal that four out of the five variables significantly affect dividend policy, though their impact varies across different phases. Notably, the previous year’s DPR consistently exerts the strongest influence, while EPS and ROA also play pivotal roles. The revenue growth rate negatively impacts dividend policy during the pre-pandemic period but loses significance during the pandemic. Liquidity, however, shows no notable correlation across all three periods. These results align with existing studies on dividend policy determinants (Ahmed & Javid, 2008; Khalaf et al., 2023), reinforcing the importance of profitability, historical trends, and resilience during economic fluctuations. The results underscore the importance of strategic dividend decisions, especially during economic disruptions like COVID-19. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Dividend; Dividend Policy; Finance; Listed Enterprises","","","","","Dynamics and Determinants of Dividend Policy in Pakistan, (2008); Corporate Ownership and Control, (2021); International Journal of Applied Economics and Finance, (2011); DeAngelo, Harry, Dividend policy and the earned/contributed capital mix: a test of the life-cycle theory, Journal of Financial Economics, 81, 2, pp. 227-254, (2006); Vnu Journal of Science Economics and Business, (2018); Journal of Economics Development, (2024); Corporate Ownership Control, (2021); Multivariate Data Analyses, (1998); Henseler, Jörg, Common Beliefs and Reality About PLS: Comments on Rönkkö and Evermann (2013), Organizational Research Methods, 17, 2, pp. 182-209, (2014); Analysis of Research Data with Spss, (2008)","","Virtus Interpress","","","","","","22209352; 23066784","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003426617"

Conducting a survey of 1,335 motorcycle freight riders in Hanoi, Vietnam, the study aims to explore their perceptions regarding the adoption of cargo EVs. Using latent class cluster analysis, the research identifies two distinct groups of cargo MC drivers based on their intention to use cargo EVs. The study characterizes each cluster to gain insights into different client categories for cargo EVs. Results indicate that nearly two-thirds of respondents would not opt for cargo EVs, citing high costs and ambiguous battery capacity as primary obstacles. The study underscores cargo EV manufacturers' importance in ensuring optimal performance, especially regarding battery components, to attract carriers expressing interest in cargo EVs. Additionally, a collaboration between manufacturers and government bodies is recommended to introduce financial incentives for early adopters, facilitating the transition from conventional cargo vehicles to cargo EVs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cargo-evs; Latent Class; Policy Options","","","","","Ipcc Fifth Assessment Synthesis Report Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, (2014); International Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems Research, (2025); Lebeau, Philippe, Exploring the choice of battery electric vehicles in city logistics: A conjoint-based choice analysis, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 91, pp. 245-258, (2016); Ngoc, An Minh, Determinants of carriers' intentions to use electric cargo vehicles in last-mile delivery by extending the technology acceptance model: a case study of Vietnam, International Journal of Logistics Management, 34, 1, pp. 210-235, (2023); Egbue, Ona, Barriers to widespread adoption of electric vehicles: An analysis of consumer attitudes and perceptions, Energy Policy, 48, pp. 717-729, (2012); Morganti, Eleonora, Technical and operational obstacles to the adoption of electric vans in France and the UK: An operator perspective, Transport Policy, 63, pp. 90-97, (2018); Jie, Wanchen, The two-echelon capacitated electric vehicle routing problem with battery swapping stations: Formulation and efficient methodology, European Journal of Operational Research, 272, 3, pp. 879-904, (2019); Quak, H.

However, in large cities facing traffic jams, travel time always fluctuates. If we change the travel time variable, the traffic equilibrium will change and we need to run the model again. The calculation time will be very large if we have to run the model many times to find the optimal model. To solve the above problem, a sensitivity analysis method of the travel time variable without using route-based variables is proposed in this paper. Based on the depth-first search algorithm, the general formulation of the derivative of the implicit function, and the chain rule of differentiation, the change in traffic flow on links concerning the variable travel time has been effectively calculated. Therefore, the approximate equilibrium could be calculated without having to rerun the model to save computational time. Finally, a hypothetical road network and a real traffic network in Japan will be used to evaluate the computational efficiency of the proposed method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Q-generalization Logit; Sensitivity Analysis; Traffic Assignment; Urban Planning","","","","","A Study of the Semi Dynamic Traffic Assignment Using the Sensitivity Analysis, (2020); Introduction to Algorithms, (2001); Dial, Robert B., A probabilistic multipath traffic assignment model which obviates path enumeration, 5, 2, pp. 83-111, (1971); Friesz, Terry L., Sensitivity analysis based heuristic algorithms for mathematical programs with variational inequality constraints, Mathematical Programming, 48, 1-3, pp. 265-284, (1990); Leurent, Fabien M., Curbing the computational difficulty of the logit equilibrium assignment model, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 31, 4 PART B, pp. 315-326, (1997); Liu, Henry X., Method of successive weighted averages (MSWA) and self-regulated averaging schemes for solving stochastic user equilibrium problem, Networks and Spatial Economics, 9, 4, pp. 485-503, (2009); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Nakayama, Shoichiro, Unified closed-form expression of logit and weibit and its extension to a transportation network equilibrium assignment, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 81, pp. 672-685, (2015); Urban Transportation Networks Equilibrium Analysis with Mathematical Programming Methods, (1985); Tobin, Roger L., Sensitivity analysis for equilibrium network flow, Transportation Science, 22, 4, pp. 242-250, (1988)","Bui Nhat, M.; Thac Quang, N.; Van Phuc, L.; Thu, T.; Dosho, Y.","Elsevier B.V.","","1st International Conference on Sustainable Development and Climate Change Adaptation in Transportation, SDCAT 2023","","Ho Chi Minh City","207652","23521457; 23521465","9798331320560; 9781713870890; 9781713870906; 9781713870913","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001921363"

To forecast it, it is necessary to understand the mechanism. However, its mechanism has yet to be studied. Based on the numerical simulation results, this study discusses abnormal water level change in a case study during the afternoon of August 2–3, 2019, and 11 July 2022. A coupled model of surge wave and tide (called SuWAT) was applied to simulate the tide, surge, and wind wave. SuWAT’s simulations were validated with the observational data of total water level and significant wave height, and the model could sufficiently reproduce the tidal, wind-induced surge and wave. The findings indicate that the unusual water level fluctuations along the western coast of the Ca Mau Peninsula resulted from a combination of high astronomical tides, storm surges, and waves. Notably, long-period swells substantially contributed to the overall water level, with peak measurements reaching 0.52 m on 3 August 2019, and 0.53 m on 11 July 2022. These surges and swell effects are mainly attributed to the study area’s prolonged and intense southwest monsoon. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abnormal Water Level Rise; Suwat; Swell; Vietnam; West Coast Of Ca Mau Peninsula","","","","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This study provides empirical evidence from two ethnic minorities in Vietnam, highlighting how perceptions of livelihood resilience vary by gender, geographical context, and ethnicity, with a particular emphasis on their intersections. Over 13 months, data were gathered through 3 focus group discussions, in-depth interviews with 9 key informants, field observations, and surveys of 136 households. The findings revealed a low average Household Livelihood Resilience (HLR) score of 0.434, indicating limited resilience among forest-dependent households facing external shocks. Notably, a significant gender gap was evident, with men demonstrating higher resilience levels than women, a disparity attributed to entrenched social norms and cultural practices. Women, often confined to domestic roles, faced barriers to community involvement and access to financial resources, which weakened their ability to cope with and recover from adverse events. To address these issues, the study advocates for climate actions that prioritize gender equality and aim to enhance women's resilience. This includes amplifying their voices through tailored training programs and initiatives such as women-managed microfinance groups. The study also emphasizes the policy implications for advancing gender equality, sustainable forest management, and livelihood resilience.

This energy poverty, particularly among the elderly, continues to affect well-being and health as the population ages. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty on the life satisfaction of elderly individuals, using data from the 2011 Vietnam National Aging Survey. As one of the first studies to explore this relationship in Vietnam, it contributes to the literature by providing valuable empirical evidence of the causal link between energy poverty and life satisfaction, shedding light on the mechanisms behind the observed effects. By adopting a multidimensional approach, we measure energy poverty across three distinct thresholds. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we employ a two-stage least squares regression, using provincial-level information and communications technology infrastructure as an instrumental variable. Our findings consistently demonstrate that energy poverty significantly and negatively impacts the life satisfaction of the elderly across all three measures. To ensure the robustness of our results, we conduct additional tests, including alternative constructions of energy poverty and the use of different instrumental variables, such as the number of Internet users per 100 population at the provincial level. We further validate our conclusions through other methods, including plausible exogenous instrumental variables and double/debiased machine learning, confirming the stability and reliability of our findings. Additionally, we identify two key pathways through which energy poverty affects life satisfaction: physical health and mental health.

In more detail, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of witnessing others’ i-deals on coworker’s emotional response (malicious envy), and the moderating effect of individualistic values on that response at both individual and national level. In addition, this study examines the impact of two types of witnessing others’ i-deals which include not only the other’s i-deals that the coworker directly observes, but also the generalized others’ i-deals which is an aggregated perception as a result of frequent observation of idiosyncratic deals enjoyed by multiple others. Data were collected from 450 employees from 5 Asian countries at two points. We adopted a hierarchical linear model (HLM) because we assume two levels for both i-deals and individualism. The results show that witnessing other’s i-deals is positively related to malicious envy. In addion, individual-level individualism was found to moderate the relationship between witnessing coworkers’ i-deals and malicious envy. Interestingly, it is not individualism at the country level, but that at the individual level that moderates the relationship between witnessing i-deals and malicious envy. This study indicates that i-deals studies on coworkers’ reactions to others’ i-deals should focus more on the moderating effect of individual cultural values. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coworker Reactions; Idiosyncratic Deals; Individualism; Malicious Envy","","","","","Social Psychology Quarterly, (1993); Matthijs Bal, P.

A framework adapted from the ASEAN Comprehensive School Safety Framework and School Disaster Resilience Assessment is utilized to evaluate policy coverage and implementation level of school safety in Vietnam. The study systematically reviewed legal documents at national level, followed by questionnaire surveys conducted for primary schools in Da Nang City, which was selected as a pilot evaluation site owing to its vulnerability to natural disasters and extensive records of school safety practices. Results show that the most critical elements of school safety have been reflected in existing policy documents and regulations. However, the gap between policies and implementation remains due to the inadequacy of school safety viewpoint, designated roles and responsibilities, resources, and guidelines for supporting the school safety practices at the local level.

We propose a set of indicators suitable to Vietnam’s social-ecological conditions based on the IUCN concepts of management effectiveness and the consultation dialogues with relevant BR stakeholders. This set includes 58 indicators, 20 headline indicators according to 6 management elements of BR: Context, Planning, Inputs, Process, Outputs and Outcomes. Management effectiveness value is divided into 5 levels (0, 25, 50, 75, 100) and thereafter categorised into 4 ranges according to the corresponding value (Very low: 0–25 points; Low: 25–50 points; Average: 50–75 points; High: 75–100 points) with the higher the value, the greater the effectiveness. Based on the indicators, we evaluated the management effectiveness of Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An BR (designated in 2009). The results of evaluating management effectiveness for this BR have determined that the overall management effectiveness for the whole BR is 78.2 out of 100 scores, equivalent to high management effectiveness. Results for management elements: element 1 (Context-85.8 score), element 2 (Planning-83.5 score), element 3 (Inputs-73.4 score), element 4 (Process-76.3 score), element 5 (Outputs-68.3 score) and element 6 (Outcomes-81.9 score). Although the indicators presented a useful analysis of management effectiveness in this particular case, owing the diversity of BRs in Vietnam in terms of socio-ecological conditions, total area, governance model and administration, caution should be applied in the treatment and/or selection of these indicators for all BR cases and the 58 indicators should be used as a guide for each specific BR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biosphere Reserves; Cu Lao Cham-hoi An; Evaluation; Management Effectiveness Indicators; Sustainable Development; Vietnam; Biosphere; Environmental Planning; Management Practice; Nature Reserve; Sustainable Development; Unesco; Viet Nam","biosphere; environmental planning; management practice; nature reserve; sustainable development; UNESCO; Viet Nam","","","We thank the Project \u201CResearch on the theoretical and practical basis and propose a guiding framework for management of world biosphere reserves recognized by UNESCO in Vietnam\u201D Code DTDLXH-06/21 and \u201CThe Japan Prize Heisei Memorial Grant\u201D (PI: Toshinori Tanaka) for financial and technical support to conduct this research.","Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, (1996); German Commission for Unesco Management Manual for Unesco Biosphere Reserves in Africa A Practical Guide for Managers, (2015); Unesco Mab Technical Guidelines for Biosphere Reserves, (2021); Unesco Mab Madrid Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves, (2008); Unesco Mab Mab Strategic Action Plan 20152025, (2015); Lima Action Plan, (2016); World Network of Biosphere Reserves, (2024); Evaluating Effectiveness A Framework for Assessing the Management of Protected Areas, (2000); International Journal of Unesco Biosphere Reserves, (2017); Unesco Biosphere Reserves Supporting Biocultural Diversity Sustainability and Society, (2019)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629984","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202731923"

We also explore the joint effect of ICT efficiency and ER on LCET. Moreover, the impact mechanisms are fully explored. The findings are as follows: (1) ICT efficiency and ER both have positive impacts on LCET, which means that they have individual low-carbon technological innovation effects. (2) The interaction of ICT efficiency and ER contributes to the rise of LCET. In other words, these two factors work synergistically to promote the development of LCET. (3) Heterogeneous effect suggests that the combined promotion effect of ICT efficiency and ER on LCET is more remarkable in regions with better economic development. (4) ICT efficiency affects LCET by encouraging R&D and fiscal spending on the environment, which means that R&D and fiscal spending on the environment are two transmission mechanisms between ER and LCET.

The dimensions of the flume were 9 m (length), 1 m (width), and 1 m (depth). The weathered granite sand from the actual landslide site at Da Nang City, Vietnam was used. The pore water pressure was measured by a pore-water pressure transducer at two depths (middle and bottom) to determine the process of rainwater infiltration into the soil. The surface deformation was measured with extensometers at three positions of the slope. The deformation of the entire slope was determined by the 160 cylindrical-shaped makers evenly spaced in the slope and three cameras. Results: The results showed that the rainfall infiltrated into the slope process, increasing from negative pore water pressure to approximately 0. The maximum shear strain contour has been plotted in total and in time increments. The shear band was detected from the time increments maximum shear strain contour. The localization in the shear band formed just before failure. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scale laboratory test ever conducted to calculate the shear band. Moreover, it was found that the failure occurred when the sand was in an unsaturated phase. Failure does not seem to depend on the increase in pore water pressure but on the maximum shear strain. This feature can be used to explain the phenomenon of landslides that occur even when the groundwater level does not increase but large deformation occurs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Failure Surface; Flume Experiment; Maximum Shear Strain; Pore Water Pressure; Rainfall-induced Landslide","","","","We are grateful to Mr. Huynh Dang Vinh, Mr. Chu Quoc Dung, Mr. Nguyen Van Hung, Ms. Nguyen Minh Hien and other colleagues at Institute of Transport and Technology, Vietnam and Japanese experts in the JICA-JST SATREPS project named \u201CDevelopment of landslide risk assessment technology along transportation arteries in Vietnam\u201D for their cooperation during this research.","Abe, Shinro, Topography and landslides in weathered granitic rock areas—Hai Van landslide in central Vietnam, Landslides, 15, 8, pp. 1675-1689, (2018); Ahmadi-Adli, Mohammad, Rainfall-triggered landslides in an unsaturated soil: a laboratory flume study, Environmental Earth Sciences, 76, 21, (2017); Alshibli, Khalid Ahmed, Shear band formation in plane strain experiments of sand, Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering - ASCE, 126, 6, pp. 495-503, (2000); Mechanics of Soils and Foundations, (2007); Cogan, Jacob, A study on the effect of rainfall and slope characteristics on landslide initiation by means of flume tests, Landslides, 16, 12, pp. 2369-2379, (2019); Cuomo, Sabatino, Material point method (Mpm) hydro-mechanical modelling of flows impacting rigid walls, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 58, 11, pp. 1730-1743, (2021); Desrues, Jacques, Shear band analysis and shear moduli calibration, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 39, 13-14, pp. 3757-3776, (2002); J Jpn Landslide Soc, (2018); Hungr, Oldrich, The Varnes classification of landslide types, an update, Landslides, 11, 2, pp. 167-194, (2014); Iverson, Richard M., Scaling and design of landslide and debris-flow experiments, Geomorphology, 244, pp. 9-20, (2015)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21978670","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197438920"

This, together with increased climate-change-driven hazards, and deplorable slum characteristics has led to considerably higher flood impacts in slum settlements. As such, there is a need for specialized flood vulnerability assessment tools that integrate features specific to the urban slums. Studies have consecrated efforts to integrated and multidimensional flood vulnerability studies. However, assessments that include social, economic, structural, and institutional realities of the slum settlements are rare in developing countries. This study comprehensively assessed the flood vulnerability in urban slums. It offers a simplified perspective of vulnerability in urban slums, capturing data from slum inhabitants, local councils, experts, and local NGOs since they often have profound insights into essential service availability, access, and quality within the study area. Utilizing data encompassing 40 indicators (exposure, susceptibility, and resilience), we assess the physical/structural, social, and economic/psychological vulnerability indices for slum households and the institutional vulnerability of 41 entities. Despite significant challenges of poor infrastructure and lack of basic disaster management tools, slum residents have developed recognizable strategies to overcome flooding. Institutions carrying out intervention activities in the slums were largely incompetent and plagued with challenges ranging from lack of technical know-how to access to funds and coordination. Finally, a significant gap exists between state efforts and the impacts of these efforts on the residents of these slums. These findings complement household-level data and provide an expanded understanding of vulnerability patterns, thus informing policymakers about interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flood Vulnerability Index (fvi); Household Surveys; Resilience; Risk Communication; Urban Slums","","","","This work was supported by the Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology, and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), the Research Unit for Realization of Sustainable Society (RURSS) at Kyoto University, and the JSPS Core-to-Core Program (Grant Number: JPJSCCB20220004).

This study aims to assess the current state of water scarcity in the HRB and assesses its vulnerability to these pressures in future. To evaluate the baseline water scarcity in the HRB, a calibrated and validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was established. Five General Circulation Models (GCMs) were employed to project the future climate under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) for the HRB. Sector-specific indicators were also used to assess the temporal and altitudinal sensitivity of the basin to climate change. These climate projections were incorporated in the SWAT model to simulate flows for three different periods: Early Future (EF; 2010–2039), Mid Future (MF; 2040–2069), and Far Future (FF; 2070–2099). The SWAT model results indicate significant increase in mean flows simulated by SWAT, ranging from 15.27 to 52.78 m3/s under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 compared to baseline flows at HRB. Additionally, the study examines the temporal variation in basin stress and scarcity levels using Falkenmark and Water scarcity indicators. The findings indicate a general decrease in the basin's stress and scarcity levels, potentially benefiting water users of the HRB, especially under RCP8.5. This study offers crucial insights for shaping policies and strategies to adapt to climate change and population growth, ultimately aiming to minimize their impacts on HRB's water resources. By informing water managers and promoting sustainable water management practices, this research can help prevent future conflicts over water allocation and infrastructure development linked with the HRB. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Climate Projections; Pakistan; Representative Concentration Pathways (rcp); Soil And Water Assessment Tool (swat); Transboundary River Basin; Water Scarcity; River Basin Projects; Climate Projection; Pakistan; Population Growth; Representative Concentration Pathway; River Basins; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Soil And Water Assessment Tools; Transboundary River Basin; Transboundary Rivers; Water Scarcity; Climate Change; Resource Management; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Water Management; Water Resource","River basin projects; Climate projection; Pakistan; Population growth; Representative concentration pathway; River basins; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil and Water assessment tools; Transboundary river basin; Transboundary rivers; Water scarcity; climate change; resource management; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; water management; water resource","","","The authors are grateful to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) for data provision for research.","Ahsan, Shafkat, Hydrological extremes and climatic controls on streamflow in Jhelum basin, NW Himalaya, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 151, 3-4, pp. 1729-1752, (2023); Al Musabbir, Abdullah, Performance Evaluation of New Rotary Blades and Roller Cutter of Versatile Multi-Crop Planter on Residue Management, Sarhad Journal of Agriculture, 38, 5, pp. 211-221, (2022); Ali, Shaukat, Twenty first century climatic and hydrological changes over Upper Indus Basin of Himalayan region of Pakistan, Environmental Research Letters, 10, 1, (2015); Carriel, Orlando Aparecido, The temperature increase due to climate warming can affect the photosynthetic responses of aquatic macrophytes from tropical lotic ecosystems, Tropical Ecology, 64, 4, pp. 612-619, (2023); Ashraf, Saqib, Impacts of climate and land-use change on groundwater recharge in the semi-arid lower Ravi River basin, Pakistan, Groundwater for Sustainable Development, 17, (2022); Bhatta, Binod, Evaluation and application of a SWAT model to assess the climate change impact on the hydrology of the Himalayan River Basin, Catena, 181, (2019); El-Rawy, M.

The primary objective is to evaluate changes in precipitation, temperature, and water balance components under different climate scenarios. We employed a multi-modal ensemble (MME) approach to enhance the accuracy of climate projections, integrating historical climate data spanning from 1950 to 2014 with downscaled projections for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, covering future periods from 2040 to 2100. Our methodology involved calibrating and validating the SWAT model against observed hydrological data to ensure reliable simulations of future climate scenarios. The model’s performance was assessed using metrics such as R2, NSE, KGE, and PBIAS, which closely aligned with recommended standards. Results reveal a significant decline in mean annual precipitation, with reductions of up to 37.86% by mid-century under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. This decline is projected to lead to substantial reductions in surface runoff, evapotranspiration, and water yield, alongside a marked decrease in mean monthly stream flow, critically impacting agricultural, domestic, and ecological water needs. The study underscores the necessity of adaptive water resource management strategies to address these anticipated changes. Key recommendations include implementing a dynamic reservoir operation system, enhancing forecasting tools, and incorporating green infrastructure to maintain water quality, support ecosystem resilience, and ensure sustainable water use in the RRB. This research emphasizes the need for localized strategies to address climate-driven hydrological changes and protect future water resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Strategies; Climate Change; Hydrological Dynamics; Ruzizi River Basin; Water Resource Management; Evapotranspiration; Resource Allocation; Water Management; Adaptive Strategy; Future Projections; Historical Data; Hydrological Dynamic; Management Strategies; Model Outputs; River Basins; Ruzizi River Basin; Water Resources Management; Waters Resources; Rivers; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Climate Modeling; Future Prospect; Hydrodynamics; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Strategic Approach; Water Budget; Water Management; Water Resource; Water Use; East African Lakes; Lake Tanganyika","Evapotranspiration; Resource allocation; Water management; Adaptive strategy; Future projections; Historical data; Hydrological dynamic; Management strategies; Model outputs; River basins; Ruzizi river basin; Water resources management; Waters resources; Rivers; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; future prospect; hydrodynamics; soil and water assessment tool; strategic approach; water budget; water management; water resource; water use; East African Lakes; Lake Tanganyika","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), Research Unit for Realization of Sustainable Society (RURSS) at Kyoto University, JSPS Core-to-Core Program (Grant Number: JPJSCCB20220004).

When combined with the clinical, historical, and epidemiological literature on scurvy, survivorship analysis, a form of statistical analysis to assess the relationship between the presence of diseases in the archeological record and survival, helps determine the overall burden of the disease both in terms of morbidity and mortality. This article explores the relationship between scurvy and survivorship in 26 adults from Man Bac, a Neolithic site from northern Vietnam together with prepublished evidence of scurvy in the nonadult population (n = 44). Methods: Diagnosis of scurvy included differential diagnosis combined with the Snoddy, A. M. E., Buckley, H. R., Elliott, G. E., Standen, V. G., Arriaza, B. T., & Halcrow, S. E. (2018).

Assessing diagnostic certainty for scurvy and rickets in human skeletal remains. American Journal of Biological Anthropology, 181, 637–645 diagnostic certainty approaches. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were produced to assess the relationship between the presence of probable scurvy and age-at-death. Results: The prevalence of probable scurvy in adults (35%) was considerably lower than reported for the nonadults (80%). Almost all lesions observed in the adults were in a mixed stage of healing. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in survivorship between infants and children (<15 years) with or without probable scurvy, whereas a meaningful difference was observed for the adults and adolescents (15+ years). Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that scurvy considerably decreased survivorship to older age categories. The degree of lesion remodeling, however, indicates that scurvy was not necessarily the direct cause of death but contributed to an overall disease burden that was ultimately fatal. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Transition; Demography; Osteological Paradox; Survivorship; Vietnam; Adult; Agricultural Transition Site; Agriculture; Anemia; Archeology; Article; Body Remains; Bone Remodeling; Clinical Article; Cohabitation; Demography; Diagnostic Accuracy; Differential Diagnosis; Enamel Hypoplasia; Female; Fracture; Gingivitis; Head Circumference; Hematoma; Human; Hypothalamus Hypophysis Adrenal System; Immediate Cause Of Death; Inflammation; Kaplan Meier Method; Lethargy; Male; Marine Environment; Maternal Mortality; Mental Health Service; Morbidity; Mortality; Neolithic; Osteopenia; Osteoporosis; Parasite Load; Pellagra; Periodontal Disease; Physical Anthropology; Population Growth; Prevalence; Pubic Symphysis; Respiratory Failure; Rickets; Risk Factor; Scurvy; Seasonal Variation; Southeast Asia; Survivorship; Tooth Disease; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Aged; Child; Epidemiology; History; Infant; Middle Aged; Preschool Child; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Scurvy; Survivorship; Vietnam; Young Adult","adult; agricultural transition site; agriculture; anemia; archeology; Article; body remains; bone remodeling; clinical article; cohabitation; demography; diagnostic accuracy; differential diagnosis; enamel hypoplasia; female; fracture; gingivitis; head circumference; hematoma; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; immediate cause of death; inflammation; Kaplan Meier method; lethargy; male; marine environment; maternal mortality; mental health service; morbidity; mortality; Neolithic; osteopenia; osteoporosis; parasite load; pellagra; periodontal disease; physical anthropology; population growth; prevalence; pubic symphysis; respiratory failure; rickets; risk factor; scurvy; seasonal variation; Southeast Asia; survivorship; tooth disease; Viet Nam; adolescent; aged; child; epidemiology; history; infant; middle aged; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Scurvy; Survivorship; Vietnam; Young Adult","","","We would like to thank Dr. Ngo Anh Son, Dr. Bui Van Khanh, and Dr. Nellissa Ling for their assistance with the radiographs.

In emerging Asia, where small family businesses play central roles in their economies, previous studies found that the sector was particularly hard hit by the pandemic. However, little is known about how households have mitigated the negative shocks on their family business during the pandemic. Using datasets from representative household surveys in seventeen Asian countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) regions, this study investigates the role of business coping strategies and government financial aid in mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic on family business conditions in the short run. We find that (i) adoption of coping strategy is associated with a lower probability of both a decline in family business income and family business closure; and (ii) government financial aid is associated with a lower probability of a decline in family business income and a higher probability of adopting coping strategies. This study is one of the first to provide empirical evidence on mitigation mechanisms of family business in emerging Asia. This is important to understand what policies will enable the family business sector to perform better during the future pandemics and other economic crises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Asia; Coping Strategy; Covid-19; Family Business; Financial Aid; Southeast Asia; Asean; Business Development; Coping Strategy; Covid-19; Finance; Household Survey; Humanitarian Aid; State Role; Central Asia","ASEAN; business development; coping strategy; COVID-19; finance; household survey; humanitarian aid; state role; Central Asia","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI).

However, research on the impacts of ETS in Vietnam is still unclear, especially since there is no study on ETS revenue redistribution policies. By developing a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this paper simulates the potential impacts of the ETS with different revenue redistribution options. The results indicate that to achieve Vietnam's target of 15.8% carbon emission reduction, the carbon price would significantly affect the economy with a GDP drop of 3.7% and a welfare loss of 2.89% of GDP. The revenue redistribution policies would lighten these negative impacts. While transferring to government activities reduces GDP loss, reducing income tax policy results in welfare improvement.

Among the various coastal protection measures, seawalls have been widely implemented to mitigate erosion and protect coastal assets. However, the interrelationship between beach erosion and seawalls remains a critical topic for investigation to ensure effective and sustainable coastal management strategies. Seawalls impact the shoreline, particularly through the “end effect”, where the seawall functions similarly to a groin, causing erosion on the downdrift side relative to the direction of wave approach. This study provides a detailed analysis of the interplay between beach erosion and seawall structures in Loc An, Vietnam, employing both remote sensing and numerical approaches. Sentinel-2 images were employed together with an analytical solution to observe the shoreline change at the Loc An sand spit and to determine input values for the numerical model. Based on the shoreline dynamics, a numerical scheme was employed to study the shoreline evolution after the construction of a seawall. Our findings show that the shoreline evolution can be divided into three stages: (1) The first stage corresponds to the elongation of the sand spit without interference from coastal structures. (2) The second stage shows the effect of jetties on the shoreline, as signaled by the buildup of sand updrift of the jetties. (3) The third stage shows the effectiveness of the seawall, where the shoreline reaches its equilibrium condition. The study provides a quick and simple method for estimating shoreline diffusivity (ε) in situations where measured data is scarce. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytical; Beach Erosion; Coastal Erosion; Numerical; Remote Sensing; Seawall; Shoreline Dynamics; Vietnam; Digital Elevation Model; Erosion; Jetties; Jurassic; Soil Erosion; Analytical; Beach Erosion; Coastal Erosion; Coastal Protection; Numerical; Remote-sensing; Sand Spits; Shoreline Dynamic; Shoreline Evolutions; Viet Nam; Beaches; Beach Erosion; Coastal Evolution; Coastal Protection; Coastal Zone Management; Remote Sensing; Shoreline Change","Digital elevation model; Erosion; Jetties; Jurassic; Soil erosion; Analytical; Beach erosion; Coastal erosion; Coastal protection; Numerical; Remote-sensing; Sand spits; Shoreline dynamic; Shoreline evolutions; Viet Nam; Beaches; beach erosion; coastal evolution; coastal protection; coastal zone management; remote sensing; shoreline change","","","","Oceans and Coasts at Rio 10 Global Conference, (2001); Almar, Rafael, Shoreline response to a sequence of typhoon and monsoon events, Water (Switzerland), 9, 6, (2017); Nguyen, Thanh Viet, Study on the effect of morphology change on salinity distribution in the Dinh an estuary, lower mekong river of Vietnam, Journal of Coastal Research, SPEC.

Although research on Vietnam tourism has grown in number, a macro analysis of national tourism governance and policies has largely been missing. Design/methodology/approach: This synthesis paper offers a systemic analysis of Vietnam’s tourism accommodating intensified government intervention and dramatic market changes in recent decades. The authors offer a chronological analysis of tourism development along with the major political and economic turns of the country. Findings: The patterns of tourism development reflect a compromise between centralization and decentralization of the governance system and a trade-off between economic and social objectives of development. Balancing these opposites, the internal strength of the domestic market and the resilience of communities and businesses become key assets for growth in circumstances where the socialist market economy continues to inform the current and future development of the industry. Research limitations/implications: Although the case of Vietnam is unique, the adaptive mechanism of the tourism industry highlighted in this paper offers a useful lesson for other developing countries. The research addresses tourism in the political economy in developing countries, which is valuable for researchers, policy analysts as well as practitioners in tourism. Practical implications: The practical contribution of the study is derived from authors’ academic and industrial backgrounds. Findings from the study serve as a useful reference for those who embark on the study of tourism governance and policy-making in developing countries and problems associated with the economic transitional process. Those problems of the disparity between centralization and decentralization of the political system might not be only significant in Vietnam, but also prevail in developing countries. Thus, this study offers a point of departure for future empirical and comparative research on the kindship of tourism and political economy in a full scale. Social implications: The transitional economy as viewed through the tourism industry is prominently presented in the “evolutionary” approach to the transitional economy, which exhibits several unique features: the transition from a centrally planned (command) economy to a market economy and the manifestations of a socialist orientation in the modern economic management system (Vuong et al., 2019). While data from this study is mainly illustrative of the first point, the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, the second characteristic, the manifestation of a social orientation has only slightly been addressed and will need further elaboration in a future study. While Vietnam’s tourism positions itself in a socialist market-oriented economy might set a unique case, the study highlights the politics of tourism is shaped by the politico-economic system. The authors conclude that the adaptation of Vietnam tourism to a socialist market-orientated economy is better perceived as a social evolution achievement rather than a feature of capitalism. Originality/value: The latest study on tourism governance (Bui et al., 2022) has outlined the evolution of the tourism administrative system and markets in the country; however, linkages of tourism to the broader political economic system have yet to be addressed. Addressing this gap, the authors carry out analysis of policies and governance from the insider’s viewpoint, when team members have been involved in numerous tourism planning and development projects, both on international and national scales. The practical experience along with thorough review of literature and statistical data contributes to shaping a fresh understanding of tourism in a transitional economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Centralization; Decentralization; Governance; Planning; Socialist Market Economy","","","","The project is funded through Japan Society for Promotion of Sciences, grant number 22H03859.","Journal of Vietnamese Studies, (2018); Tourism in Southeast Asia Challenges and New Direction, (2009); Britton, Stephen G., Tourism, capital, and place: towards a critical geography of tourism, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 9, 4, pp. 451-478, (1991); Britton, Stephen G., The political economy of tourism in the third world, Annals of Tourism Research, 9, 3, pp. 331-358, (1982); Austrian Journal of South East Asian Studies, (2011); Global Climate Change and Coastal Tourism, (2017); Tourism and Development in Southeast Asia, (2020); Bui, Huong T., The History and Evolution of Vietnam Tourism, pp. 12-27, (2022); Bui, Huong T., The adaptive resilience of living cultural heritage in a tourism destination, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 28, 7, pp. 1022-1040, (2020); Bui, Huong T., Tourism Policies and Governance, pp. 28-44, (2022)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","16605373; 17598451","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191759457"

Although meaning-recognition is generally more convenient, think-aloud protocols have revealed that in comparison to meaning-recall, meaning-recognition is more susceptible to blind guessing and the use of construct-irrelevant test strategies. Perhaps because of this, meaning-recall tends to be a stronger predictor of reading ability. Following Budescu (1988), this article reports on three studies that investigated an extended-matching test (EMT) format that was designed to address these limitations of meaning-recognition while retaining its convenience. An EMT with 90 target words was developed. It contained three clusters, each with a 30:130 ratio of target words to Vietnamese L2 response options. In comparison to meaning-recall criterion measures, the EMT did not meaningfully differ in terms of internal reliability, mean scores, and, importantly, the strength of the correlation with reading comprehension scores. The consistency of correct/incorrect response classifications ranged from 83 % to 86 %. These initial findings suggest that the EMT format may be used interchangeably with meaning-recall for many research purposes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assisted Meaning-recall; Extended-matching; Meaning-recall; Meaning-recognition; Second Language Vocabulary Testing","","","","","Aviad-Levitzky, Tami, The New Computer Adaptive Test of Size and Strength (CATSS): Development and Validation, Language Assessment Quarterly, 16, 3, pp. 345-368, (2019); Barr, Dale J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal, Journal of Memory and Language, 68, 3, pp. 255-278, (2013); undefined, (2020); Vocabulary Education and Research Bulletin, (2012); Brysbaert, Marc, Power analysis and effect size in mixed effects models: A tutorial, Journal of Cognition, 1, 1, (2018); Budescu, David V., On the Feasibility of Multiple Matching Tests— Variations on a Theme by Guiliksen, Applied Psychological Measurement, 12, 1, pp. 5-14, (1988); undefined, (2008); International Journal of Internet Science, (2016); Green, Peter, SIMR: An R package for power analysis of generalized linear mixed models by simulation, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 7, 4, pp. 493-498, (2016); Gries, Stefan Th, (Generalized Linear) Mixed-Effects Modeling: A Learner Corpus Example, Language Learning, 71, 3, pp. 757-798, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","27727661","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190960943"

However, there are limited studies on the effect of firm clusters on the well-being of rural communities, particularly in terms of income improvement, poverty reduction, and migration. Our research aims to shed light on these relationships at both the household and commune levels. For empirical analysis, we employ the propensity score matching method to mitigate endogeneity bias. Our results reveal the role of firm clusters in increasing income and reducing poverty. Firm clusters also contribute to decreasing labor emigration and attracting immigrants. However, the magnitude of these impacts is relatively small, with moderate effects on income and modest effects on poverty and migration. In particular, firm clusters reduce the commune poverty rate by around 2.36%–2.51% and enhance household annual income by approximately 16.46–17.08 million VND (725–752 USD). Furthermore, analyses at the household level highlight the significance of larger clusters in improving household income.

We compared the performance of WC and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) to detect the clustering of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in rural Vietnam. Methods: We obtained data from a baseline survey of the Khanh Hoa Cardiovascular Study comprising 2942 middle-aged residents (40–60 years). We used areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) to compare the performance of WC and WHtR in predicting CVD risk clustering (≥2 of the following risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and elevated C-reactive protein). Results: The optimal cut-off values for WC were 81.8 and 80.7 cm for men and women, respectively. Regarding the clustering of CVD risk factors, the AUROC (95% CI) of WC and WHtR were 0.707 (0.676 to 0.739) and 0.719 (0.689 to 0.749) in men, and 0.682 (0.654 to 0.709) and 0.690 (0.663 to 0.717) in women, respectively. Compared with WC, WHtR had a better NRI (0.229; 0.102–0.344) and IDI (0.012; 0.004–0.020) in men and a better NRI (0.154; 0.050–0.257) in women. Conclusions: The optimal WC cut-off for Vietnamese men was approximately 10 cm below the recommended Asian cut-off. WHtR might perform slightly better in predicting the clustering of CVD risk factors among the rural population in Vietnam. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Cardiovascular Disease; Cluster Analysis; Comparative Study; Epidemiology; Etiology; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factor; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factor; Rural Population; Viet Nam; Waist Circumference; Waist To Height Ratio; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cluster Analysis; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Vietnam; Waist Circumference; Waist-height Ratio","adult; cardiovascular disease; cluster analysis; comparative study; epidemiology; etiology; female; heart disease risk factor; human; male; middle aged; risk factor; rural population; Viet Nam; waist circumference; waist to height ratio; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cluster Analysis; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Vietnam; Waist Circumference; Waist-Height Ratio","","","The Khanh Hoa Cardiovascular Study project was funded by the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (19A06), Pfizer Health Research Foundation and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI JP19K20536; JP21J01171; 21\u2009K17301).

Although ample studies have explored the determinants of healthcare spending, the current study examines the determinants of health financing transition in 124 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for 19 years, from 2000 to 2018. The study first estimates the elasticity of health expenditure (i.e., government, private, and external) to per capita income, fiscal spending, age dependency, control of corruption, and time; second, it investigates crowding-out/in effects between domestic and external health financing. As the sample countries are heterogeneous in terms of development and universal health coverage (UHC) reform, our study employs a panel regression model with cluster-robust fixed effects and a bootstrapping quantile regression with fixed effects model to capture unobserved heterogeneity and produce robust estimates across quantile distributions. The results show that an increase in per capita government health expenditure (GHE) and per capita external health expenditure from foreign donors can reduce the share of out-of-pocket health expenditure to total health expenditure (OOPHE), thereby improving the health status and well-being of the people. The study also finds crowding-out effects of per capita external health financing on GHE in LIMCs. Interestingly, the results show that the control of corruption increases the per capita GHE in low-income countries. Thus, in low-income countries, improving governance would improve efficiency in fund utilization and strengthen the health system. Further, our study concludes that those countries that have passed UHC legislation are moving faster toward health financing transition by increasing public spending on health care. Healthcare policy in developing countries should prioritize (i) the adoption and implementation of UHC reform, (ii) alternative revenue mobilization strategy for financing public health care. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C21; Control Of Corruption; D63; Distributional Heterogeneity; External Health Assistance; F35; Government Health Expenditure; H51; I18; K42; Quantile Regression; Universal Health Coverage Legislation; Age; Bootstrapping; Corruption; Developing World; Finance; Health Expenditure; Health Insurance; Health Policy; Health Status; International Aid; Regression","age; bootstrapping; corruption; developing world; finance; health expenditure; health insurance; health policy; health status; international aid; regression","","","","Arends, Helge, More with Less?

While vendors tout the neoliberal incentives of emotion-recognition technology as a pre-eminent tool of workplace wellness, we argue that emotional AI recalibrates the horizons of capital not by expanding outward into the consumer realm (like surveillance capitalism). Rather, as a new genus of digital Taylorism, it turns inward, passing through the corporeal exterior to extract greater surplus value and managerial control from the affective states of workers. Thus, empathic surveillance signals a profound shift in the ontology of human labor relations. In the emotionally quantified workplace, employees are no longer simply seen as physical capital, but conduits of actuarial and statistical intelligence gleaned from their most intimate subjective states. As a result, affect-driven automated management means that priority is often given to actuarial rather than human-centered managerial decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affect; Automated Management; Digital Taylorism; Emotional Ai; Future Of Work; Precarity; Surveillance; Automation; Emotion Recognition; Affect; Affect Recognition; Automated Management; Digital Taylorism; Emotional Ai; Future Of Works; Human-centric; Precarity; Surveillance; Wellbeing; Human Resource Management","Automation; Emotion Recognition; Affect; Affect recognition; Automated management; Digital taylorism; Emotional AI; Future of works; Human-centric; Precarity; Surveillance; Wellbeing; Human resource management","","","This study is part of the project \u201CEmotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life \u201D funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6.

Central Vietnam, located near the centre of this transitional region, has encountered numerous effects. As a result, its sediments from lakes or speleothems are valuable archives for interpreting past climate variability. However, there is still a lack of high-resolution paleoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions during the Holocene in Vietnam. Our study presents a paleoenvironmental diatom-based record of sediment cores collected from Biển Hồ maar lake (14°03′N, 108°00′E) in the Central Highlands of Vietnam covering nearly the entire Holocene. Based on changes in diatom assemblages in the sediment sequence, we identified two periods of the Early Holocene (~11,700–7800 cal BP) and the Mid- to Late-Holocene (~7800–360 cal BP), which mark a remarkable shift in the environment around Biển Hồ. Alternations of key diatom species during the Early Holocene indicate intensity variations between water-mixing and thermal stratification mechanisms in meso-eutrophic conditions. During the Mid- to Late-Holocene, the complete dominance of Aulacoseira granulata var. granulata implies year-round destratification and intense mixing of the lake water column in a permanently eutrophic environment. Its morphological variability reveals intervals of dry environmental conditions driven by pronounced droughts across the Asian continent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Highlands; Diatoms; Drought; Holocene; Maar Lake; Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction; Seasonal Monsoon; Southeast Asia; Diatom; Drought; Environmental Conditions; Environmental Factor; Extreme Event; Holocene; Lake Water; Maar; Mixing Ratio; Monsoon; Paleoclimate; Paleoenvironment; Reconstruction; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","diatom; drought; environmental conditions; environmental factor; extreme event; Holocene; lake water; maar; mixing ratio; monsoon; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; reconstruction; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","","","","Abdel Karim, A.

Using a unique bi-annually household-level dataset from 2012–2016 from Vietnam, we obtain key findings as follows. To mitigate possible endogeneity concerns, we utilize a two-stage least squares regression (2SLS) approach, employing the development of information and communication (ICT) infrastructure at the province level as an instrumental variable (IV). The key findings can be summarized as follows. First, urbanization significantly reduces Vietnamese households’ inpatient and outpatient health expenses. Second, the self-treatment expenses of households increase as the process of urbanization advances. In addition, we perform various robustness checks, encompassing different measures of urbanization, the use of lag of urbanization as an additional IV, and the plausible exogenous IV. The outcomes derived from these rigorous sensitivity analyses substantiate the reliability and consistency of our key results.

One mechanism for promotion of economic development is government-driven policy. The problem is that it is not clear whether public-led economic promotion attracts consumers and which promotion factors are relatively significant for boosting particular goods. This paper examines attributes of green tea products likely influencing consumer preferences, focusing on the Thai Nguyen area in Vietnam as an example. In this area, the “One Commune, One Product” (OCOP) project has been implemented by the local government. This study employs randomized conjoint analysis based on data collected from 450 randomly selected consumers in several local supermarkets. Interestingly, the results show that online style sales have a negative preference for the purchase of green tea products, while transparency, such as the traceability of the product and product information, and reliability, such as certification, enhance the purchase of these products by consumers. However, this finding is not necessarily robust because our results indicate that approximately 90% of consumers tend to choose the default pair, which means that they do not actively prefer the product, possibly implying that this kind of public-led promotion is not yet broadly familiar to all people. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attributes For Preference; Causal Inference; Conjoint Analysis; Green Tea; Ocop; Thai Nguyen; Certification; Conjoint Analysis; Consumption Behavior; Economic Development; Local Government; Marketing; Perception; Public Attitude; Tea; Thai Nguyen; Viet Nam","certification; conjoint analysis; consumption behavior; economic development; local government; marketing; perception; public attitude; tea; Thai Nguyen; Viet Nam","","","","World Tea Production and Trade Current and Future Development 2015; Hong, Nguyen Bich, Improvement in irrigation water use efficiency: a strategy for climate change adaptation and sustainable development of Vietnamese tea production, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 19, 4, pp. 1247-1263, (2017); Munasinghe, Mohan, Economic, social and environmental impacts and overall sustainability of the tea sector in Sri Lanka, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 12, pp. 155-169, (2017); Deka, Nabajyoti, Organic cultivation and sustainable value chain development for tea smallholders: Findings from Assam, India, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 32, pp. 562-579, (2022); Hong, Nguyen Bich, Environmental efficiency and economic losses of Vietnamese tea production: Implications for cost savings and environmental protection, Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, 61, 2, pp. 383-390, (2016); Global Market Report Cocoa, (2019); Biggs, Eloise M., The tea landscape of Assam: Multi-stakeholder insights into sustainable livelihoods under a changing climate, Environmental Science and Policy, 82, pp. 9-18, (2018); Ganbold, Narangerel, An evaluation of subsidy policy impacts, transient and persistent technical efficiency: A case of Mongolia, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 7, pp. 9223-9242, (2022); Crops and Livestock Products, (2024); Nguyen-Thi-Lan, Huong, Crop farming and technical efficiency of tea production nexus: An analysis of environmental impacts, Journal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences, 22, 3, pp. 158-164, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195807782"

To date, most studies have focused on ECs in industrialized economies. Less have considered barriers to electric mobility in developing countries, where motorcycles provide most transport. To contribute to this literature, this study aimed to systematically compare differences between barriers that impede EC and EM adoption. Focusing on Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, we leveraged data from a quantitative survey (n = 944) targeting potential adopters. Using exploratory factor analysis and a regression model, we investigated the influence of structural conditions—environmental, economic, social, institutional, etc.—on psychological factors that hamper EC/EM purchase intentions. Our findings reveal important commonalities and differences across barriers that hamper adoption intentions for each technology. This study thereby improves understanding of the complex interdependence among structural conditions in urban settings and their role in creating psychological barriers to electric mobility adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption; Barriers; Developing Countries; Electric Vehicles; Purchase Intention; Vietnam; Economics; Electric Loads; Electric Motorcycles; Energy Security; Factor Analysis; Regression Analysis; Adoption; Barrier; Electric Cars; Electric Mobility; Electric Motorcycle; Environmental Loads; Purchase Intention; Structural Condition; Transportation System; Viet Nam; Developing Countries; Cycle Transport; Developing World; Electric Vehicle; Factor Analysis; Regression Analysis; Ho Chi Minh City","Economics; Electric loads; Electric motorcycles; Energy security; Factor analysis; Regression analysis; Adoption; Barrier; Electric cars; Electric mobility; Electric motorcycle; Environmental loads; Purchase intention; Structural condition; Transportation system; Viet Nam; Developing countries; cycle transport; developing world; electric vehicle; factor analysis; regression analysis; Ho Chi Minh City","","","","undefined, (2009); Adhikari, Madhusudhan, Identification and analysis of barriers against electric vehicle use, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 12, (2020); Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, (1991); Sustainable Cities Authenticity Ambition and Dream, (2018); Bastos, Suzana Quinet De Andrade, Is there a relationship between the use of motorcycles and the level of development of countries?, Bulletin of Geography.

Our findings are three-fold. First, provincial income clustering in Vietnam follows patterns of club convergence towards multiple equilibria. Seven convergence clubs encompassing 61 provinces are identified. Second, spatial autocorrelation encourages neighboring provinces to converge toward shared income equilibria. High-income clusters are observed in the Northern and Southern Key Economic Regions, while low-income clusters are concentrated in the mountainous areas of Northern Vietnam. Finally, both internal and external factors significantly affect the formation of convergence clubs. Vital internal factors include localities’ initial conditions of physical capital and structural change. Meanwhile, external factors refer to spatial externalities among neighboring provinces. We highlight spatial complementarity in physical capital accumulation and spatial competition in industrial intensification among neighboring provinces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Club Convergence; Income Clustering; O40; O47; R10; R11; Spatial Dependence; Spatial Externalities; Structural Changes; Vietnam","","","","","Aginta, Harry, Spatial dynamics of consumer price in Indonesia: convergence clubs and conditioning factors, Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science, 5, 2, pp. 427-451, (2021); Anselin, Luc E., Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA, Geographical Analysis, 27, 2, pp. 93-115, (1995); Bartkowska, Monika, Regional convergence clubs in Europe: Identification and conditioning factors, Economic Modelling, 29, 1, pp. 22-31, (2012); Bentzen, Jan, Regional income convergence in an emerging Asian economy: empirical evidence from Vietnam, Post-Communist Economies, 33, 1, pp. 64-78, (2021); Cutrini, Eleonora, Economic integration, structural change, and uneven development in the European Union, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 50, pp. 102-113, (2019); Le, Thi Thu Diem, Fiscal decentralization and income convergence: evidence from Vietnam, Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy, 29, 3, pp. 1513-1532, (2024); Revilla Diez, Javier, Vietnam 30 years after Doi Moi: Achievements and challenges, Zeitschrift fur Wirtschaftsgeographie, 60, 3, pp. 121-133, (2016); Du, Kerui, Econometric convergence test and club clustering using stata, Stata Journal, 17, 4, pp. 882-900, (2017); Spatial Econometrics from Cross Sectional Data to Spatial Panels, (2014); Esiyok, Bulent, A SPATIAL REGRESSION APPROACH to FDI in Vietnam: PROVINCE-LEVEL EVIDENCE, Singapore Economic Review, 62, 2, pp. 459-481, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","25097954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189915492"

In the proposed method, both capacitance and dc-offset voltage of the decoupling capacitors are designed unbalanced with the bottom capacitor having a dominant effect over the top one, which reduces the decoupling capacitance requirements compared to the previous works. In addition, the effect of lower dc-link capacitance in reducing power rating of the precharge resistor, typically used in OBC applications, is presented. This effect, overlooked in previous literature, leads to reducing volume and cost of the OBC. A small signal model of the HSC-PD is introduced, and a modified feedback control strategy is proposed, offering lower memory usage and calculation effort for the digital signal processor (DSP) microcontroller when compared with conventional proportional resonant (PR) controllers. The comparisons of the proposed method with other HSC-PD counterparts as well as with the conventional E-cap method are given. Finally, a 7.4-kW prototype of an 820-V interleaved totem-pole power factor correction (PFC) with an HSC-PD is built and tested to verify the superior performance of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","800-v Electric Vehicles; Electrolytic Capacitor (e-cap); Half-bridge Split Capacitor; On-board Battery Charger (obc); Power Decoupling (pd); Capacitance; Controllers; Digital Control Systems; Electric Machine Control; Electric Power System Control; Electric Vehicles; Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors; Secondary Batteries; 800v Electric Vehicle; Battery; Capacitor Power; Electrolytic Capacitor;; Frequency Control; Half-bridge; Half-bridge Split Capacitor; Obc;; Power Decoupling; Power Decoupling;; Electrolytic Capacitors","Capacitance; Controllers; Digital control systems; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric vehicles; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; Secondary batteries; 800v electric vehicle; Battery; Capacitor power; Electrolytic capacitor;; Frequency control; Half-bridge; Half-bridge split capacitor; OBC;; Power decoupling; Power decoupling;; Electrolytic capacitors","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DN2022-20-04.","Barroso, Daniel Goretti L., Electrified Automotive Propulsion Systems: State-of-the-Art Review, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 8, 2, pp. 2898-2914, (2022); Park, Yongwan, DAB Converter for EV Onboard Chargers Using Bare-Die SiC MOSFETs and Leakage-Integrated Planar Transformer, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 8, 1, pp. 209-224, (2022); Yilmaz, Murat, Review of battery charger topologies, charging power levels, and infrastructure for plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 5, pp. 2151-2169, (2013); Global Ev Outlook 2022, (2022); Khaligh, Alireza, Global Trends in High-Power On-Board Chargers for Electric Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 68, 4, pp. 3306-3324, (2019); Oh, Chang-yeol, A high-efficient nonisolated single-stage on-board battery charger for electric vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 12, pp. 5746-5757, (2013); Li, Bin, Bi-directional on-board charger architecture and control for achieving ultra-high efficiency with wide battery voltage range, Conference Proceedings - IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC, pp. 3688-3694, (2017); Zhang, Zhengda, High-Efficiency High-Power-Density CLLC Resonant Converter with Low-Stray-Capacitance and Well-Heat-Dissipated Planar Transformer for EV On-Board Charger, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 35, 10, pp. 10831-10851, (2020); Lu, Jiangheng, Dynamic Strategy for Efficiency Estimation in a CCM-Operated Front-End PFC Converter for Electric Vehicle Onboard Charger, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 3, 3, pp. 545-553, (2017); Musavi, Fariborz, Evaluation and efficiency comparison of front end AC-DC plug-in hybrid charger topologies, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 1, pp. 413-421, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23327782","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166782732"

Moreover, Vietnam ranks as one of the top five countries most severely affected by climate change, with 1/3 of residents facing flood risks. This study presents a model to identify flood susceptibility using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in the GIS environment for Hanoi, Vietnam. Nine flood-conditioning factors were selected and used as initial data. The AHP analysis was utilized to determine the priority levels of these factors concerning flood susceptibility and to assess the consistency of the obtained results to develop a flood-susceptibility map. The performance of the model was found to be significant based on the AUC value for the obtained receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The flood-susceptibility map has five levels of flood susceptibility: the area with a very high susceptibility to flooding accounts for less than 1% of the map, high- susceptibility areas for nearly 11%, moderate-susceptibility areas for more than 65%, low- susceptibility areas for about 22%, and very low-susceptibility areas for 2%. Most of Hanoi has a moderate level of flood susceptibility, which is expected to increase with urban expansion due to the impacts of urbanization. Our findings will be valuable for future research involving urban planners, and disaster management authorities and will enable them to make informed decisions aimed at reducing the impact of urban flooding and enhancing the resilience of urban communities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Flood Susceptibility; Flood-conditioning Factors; Geographic Information Systems; Hanoi; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Disaster Management; Ecosystem Resilience; Flooding; Gis; Hazard Assessment; Urbanization; Hanoi; Viet Nam","analytical hierarchy process; disaster management; ecosystem resilience; flooding; GIS; hazard assessment; urbanization; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","","Ruan, Jieer, Assessment of temporal and spatial progress of urban resilience in Guangzhou under rainstorm scenarios, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 66, (2021); Nkeki, Felix Ndidi, Flood risk mapping and urban infrastructural susceptibility assessment using a GIS and analytic hierarchical raster fusion approach in the Ona River Basin, Nigeria, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 77, (2022); Najibi, Nasser, Recent trends in the frequency and duration of global floods, Earth System Dynamics, 9, 2, pp. 757-783, (2018); Tellman, Beth, Satellite imaging reveals increased proportion of population exposed to floods, Nature, 596, 7870, pp. 80-86, (2021); Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather Climate and Water Extremes 1970 2012, (2025); World Disasters Report 2002, (2020); Dhiman, R., Flood risk and adaptation in Indian coastal cities: recent scenarios, Applied Water Science, 9, 1, (2019); Shao, Zhenfeng, Exploring the relationship between urbanization and ecological environment using remote sensing images and statistical data: A case study in the Yangtze River Delta, China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 14, (2020); Quan, Ruisong, Waterlogging risk assessment based on land use/cover change: A case study in Pudong New Area, Shanghai, Environmental Earth Sciences, 61, 6, pp. 1113-1121, (2010); Li, Jiada, Evaluating real-time control of stormwater drainage network and green stormwater infrastructure for enhancing flooding resilience under future rainfall projections, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 198, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194377600"

Employing a double-hurdle model, our empirical findings reveal a negative relationship between energy poverty and health expenditure. Specifically, our results indicate that for each incremental unit increase in energy poverty, there is a substantial reduction of 42.5 percentage points in the overall health expenditure of the households. Furthermore, as energy poverty deepens, we observe declines of 24.6 percentage points and 45.5 percentage points in the expenses incurred for inpatient/outpatient care and self-treatment, respectively. To validate the robustness of our results, we conduct several sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching, double/debiased machine learning. Across all these methods, our findings consistently underscore the significant and persistent adverse impact of energy poverty on the examined outcome variables. Additionally, to examine the underlying pathways, we conduct a structural equation modeling analysis and find that the relationship between energy poverty and health expenses is mediated by household hospitalization and expenditures on essential items, such as food and daily necessities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Poverty; Health Expenditure; Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index; Vhlss","","","","We acknowledge the financial support that we received from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up (Grant No.23K18795).","Abbas, Khizar, Assessing an empirical relationship between energy poverty and domestic health issues: A multidimensional approach, Energy, 221, (2021); Adusah-Poku, Frank, Energy poverty in Ghana: Any progress so far?, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 112, pp. 853-864, (2019); Ddml Double Debiased Machine Learning in Stata, (2023); Alkire, Sabina, Measuring Acute Poverty in the Developing World: Robustness and Scope of the Multidimensional Poverty Index, World Development, 59, pp. 251-274, (2014); Awaworyi Churchill, Sefa, Neighbourhood ethnic diversity and mental health in Australia, Health Economics (United Kingdom), 28, 9, pp. 1075-1087, (2019); Banerjee, Rajabrata, Energy poverty, health and education outcomes: Evidence from the developing world, Energy Economics, 101, (2021); Bardazzi, Rossella, Ageing and private transport fuel expenditure: Do generations matter?, Energy Policy, 117, pp. 396-405, (2018); Barrella, Roberto, Evaluating the impact of energy efficiency strategies on households’ energy affordability: A Spanish case study, Energy and Buildings, 295, (2023); Bukari, Chei, Energy poverty and health expenditure: Evidence from Ghana, Energy Economics, 103, (2021); Castaño-Rosa, Raúl, Energy poverty goes south?

We tested whether this regressive shift was more acutely perceived and experienced by women in countries with greater gender equality. Cross-cultural longitudinal survey data for women and men (N = 10,238) was collected weekly during the first few months of the pandemic. Multilevel modelling analyses, based on seven waves of data collection, indicated that a regressive shift was broadly perceived but not uniformly felt. Women and men alike perceived a shift toward a more traditional division of household labor during the first few weeks of the pandemic. However, this perception only undermined women’s satisfaction with their personal relationships and subjective mental health if they lived in countries with higher levels of economic gender equality. Among women in countries with lower levels of economic gender equality, the perceived shift predicted higher relationship satisfaction and mental health. There were no such effects among men. Taken together, our results suggest that subjective perceptions of disempowerment, and the gender role norms that underpin them, should be considered when examining the gendered impact of global crisis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Division Of Labor; Gender Equality; Gender Roles; Interpersonal Relationships; Relationship Quality; Well Being","","","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions This work was funded, in part, by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada awarded to the first author as well as a European Commission Grant (725128) awarded to the second author.","Aarntzen, Lianne, Work-family guilt as a straightjacket.

This is the first regional analysis to systematically document students’ access to remote learning based on survey data and to investigate how school closures and remote learning access affected children's learning progress. The results are based on survey responses from 2200 households. We find that 79% of the respondents felt that their children's learning progress was slower during school closures than it would have been with in-person schooling. Slightly less than half of all children experienced very little or no learning progress. Three characteristics were strongly correlated with learning progress. First, boys were more likely than girls to experience very little or no progress. Second, children from households in the top 30% of the income distribution were more likely to progress at the same rate as in-person classes, compared to children from lower income households. Third, comparing the different remote learning modes, internet-based learning or multiple learning modes provided children with a better chance of maintaining learning progress than other single modes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Learning Loss; School Closure; Southeast Asia; Covid-19; Education; Learning; Pandemic; Student; Southeast Asia","COVID-19; education; learning; pandemic; student; Southeast Asia","","","","Fixing the Foundation Teachers and Basic Education in East Asia and Pacific, (2023); Andrabi, Tahir, Human Capital Accumulation and Disasters Evidence from the Pakistan Earthquake of 2005, Journal of Human Resources, 58, 4, pp. 1057-1096, (2023); J Southeast Asian Econ, (2023); undefined, (2023); Banerjee, Abhijit V., Pitfalls of participatory programs: Evidence from a randomized evaluation in education in India, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 2, 1, pp. 1-30, (2010); undefined, (2021); Betthäuser, Bastian A., A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature Human Behaviour, 7, 3, pp. 375-385, (2023); Cashman, Laura, Parental involvement in low-achieving children's learning: The role of household wealth in rural India, International Journal of Educational Research, 105, (2021); Dang, Hai Anh H., What Explains Vietnam's Exceptional Performance in Education Relative to Other Countries?

The most recent concept, Planetary Health, has been spontaneously developed and promoted as a new science since 2015, with the establishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This coincidence marks a new era of interconnection between Global Health and Sustainable Development. However, this connection has rarely been examined, and a full-scale study covering the essential elements of Planetary Health is lacking. In this study, we aim to (a) provide an insightful understanding of the current research on Planetary Health, (b) address the interconnectedness between Planetary Health and SDGs and sustainability,s and (c) explore the determinants of Planetary Health in Sustainable Development context. The findings from diverse articles have revealed an increase in research interest among scholars in Planetary Health and Sustainable Development. However, regarding new contributions, most research deals with the topic in general terms rather than developing an analytical framework of concepts. Among the three pillars of sustainability, linkages have been strongly established between the economic and social impacts on Planetary Health while the environmental dimension has been slightly neglected.

Based on a sample of 800 individuals who visited Da Nang, Vietnam between July and August 2023, a latent class behavior model was developed to investigate preferences for bike-sharing services from tourists’ point of view. The results show that tourists prefer a bike-sharing service that ensures round-the-clock availability, is accessible within a 5-min walk from both the origin and destination, features bikes stationed at specific designated locations, and provides a variety of payment options at an affordable rate of USD 1.00 per h. Under these attributes, about 41.63% of tourists are likely to choose a bike-sharing option for their travel tours. These findings offer valuable insights for traffic management authorities and policymakers, demonstrating that bike-sharing services can be hailed as an effective complement to existing transportation modes and can help bridge the gap between supply and demand in tourist cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bike-sharing Service; Latent Class Model; Tourism Context; Tourists’ Preference; Accessibility; Policy Making; Tourist Behavior; Tourist Destination; Traffic Management; Da Nang; Viet Nam","accessibility; policy making; tourist behavior; tourist destination; traffic management; Da Nang; Viet Nam","","","","Jain, Deepty, Sustainable mobility indicators for Indian cities: Selection methodology and application, Ecological Indicators, 79, pp. 310-322, (2017); Pulido-Fernández, Juan Ignacio, Are tourists really willing to pay more for sustainable destinations?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 8, 12, (2016); Journal of Public Transportation, (2009); Teixeira, João Filipe, Empirical evidence on the impacts of bikesharing: a literature review, Transport Reviews, 41, 3, pp. 329-351, (2021); Masiero, Lorenzo, Tourists intra-destination visits and transport mode: A bivariate probit model, Annals of Tourism Research, 43, pp. 529-546, (2013); Watthanaklang, Duangdao, Measuring the motivation to ride bicycles for tourism through a comparison of tourist attractions, Transport Policy, 52, pp. 153-163, (2016); Banet, Krystian, Using city-bike stopovers to reveal spatial patterns of urban attractiveness, Current Issues in Tourism, 25, 18, pp. 2887-2904, (2022); Durán-Román, José Luis, Tourists' willingness to pay to improve sustainability and experience at destination, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 19, (2021); Fukushige, Tatsuya, Can an Incentive-Based approach to rebalancing a Dock-less Bike-share system Work?

Focusing on urban residential areas, riverside communities, suburbs, and rural regions, the research investigates the extent and impact of plastic waste in these diverse settings. Additionally, the study examines the accumulation of plastics at barriers, under bridges, and in the Hau River, identifying the predominance of single-use plastics and their environmental implications. The key findings indicate that the plastic waste leakage at land-based-source emission sites is substantial, with waste persisting for extended periods without effective clean-up. The study reveals a significant accumulation of plastics at barriers and bridge bases in aquatic environments, including along the river. The pollution level was observed to be more influenced by the quantity of waste rather than its mass per unit area, emphasizing the need for targeted waste reduction strategies. The study also identifies seven types of plastic, each associated with different sources of accumulation or settlement. This variety presents both challenges and opportunities for waste management and recycling. Significantly, the research underscores the potential of repurposing plastic waste into recycled products, aligning with the circular economy model. This approach not only extends the lifecycle of plastic products but also contributes to reducing plastic waste generation and minimizing the environmental impact. Overall, the findings highlight the urgent need for improved waste management practices in Vietnam, particularly in urban and riverside areas, and advocate for innovative recycling solutions to mitigate the environmental challenges posed by plastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accumulation; Can Tho City; Circular Economy; Deposition; Plastic Waste; Sustainability; Elastomers; Life Cycle; Plastic Products; Plastic Recycling; River Pollution; Rivers; Waste Management; Accumulation; Aquatic Environments; Can Tho City; Circular Economy; Comprehensive Analysis; Management Strategies; Plastics Waste; Sustainable Management; Terrestrial Environments; Viet Nam; Sustainable Development; Bridge; Leakage; Plastic Waste; Recycling; Reduction; Waste Management; Can Tho; Hau River","Elastomers; Life cycle; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; River pollution; Rivers; Waste management; Accumulation; Aquatic environments; Can tho city; Circular economy; Comprehensive analysis; Management strategies; Plastics waste; Sustainable management; Terrestrial environments; Viet Nam; Sustainable development; bridge; leakage; plastic waste; recycling; reduction; waste management; Can Tho; Hau River","","","","Blettler, Martín César María, Freshwater plastic pollution: Recognizing research biases and identifying knowledge gaps, Water Research, 143, pp. 416-424, (2018); Geyer, Roland, Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made, Science Advances, 3, 7, (2017); Jambeck, Jenna R., Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean, Science, 347, 6223, pp. 768-771, (2015); Single Use Plastics A Roadmap for Sustainability, (2018); Conchubhair, Diarmuid Ó., Joint effort among research infrastructures to quantify the impact of plastic debris in the ocean, Environmental Research Letters, 14, 6, (2019); Barnes, David Keith Alan, Accumulation and fragmentation of plastic debris in global environments, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 364, 1526, pp. 1985-1998, (2009); Barboza, Luís Gabriel Antão, Marine microplastic debris: An emerging issue for food security, food safety and human health, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 133, pp. 336-348, (2018); Schwabl, Philipp, Detection of various microplastics in human stool: A prospective case series, Annals of Internal Medicine, 171, 7, pp. 453-457, (2019); undefined, (2019); National Environmental Status Report in 2019, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190384542"

We used panel two-way robust fixed effects and panel quantile regression for empirical analysis. The results show that per capita income, social support, and freedom to make life choices positively impact happiness, while air pollution exposure has a negative impact. However, gender inequality does not significantly affect happiness levels. These findings highlight the relevance of the Easterlin Paradox, which suggests that income can mediate happiness by promoting emotional well-being, gender equality, and a clean environment.

Method: In this study, we examined the mediators of the relationship between individualism measured at the country level and parental burnout measured at the individual level in 36 countries (16,059 parents). Results: The results revealed three mediating mechanisms, that is, self-discrepancies between socially prescribed and actual parental selves, high agency and self-directed socialization goals, and low parental task sharing, by which individualism leads to an increased risk of burnout among parents. Conclusion: The results confirm that the three mediators under consideration are all involved, and that mediation was higher for self-discrepancies between socially prescribed and actual parental selves, then parental task sharing, and lastly self-directed socialization goals. The results provide some important indications of how to prevent parental burnout at the societal level in Western countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Exhaustion; Fathers; Individualism; Mothers; Burnout; Child; Child Parent Relation; Epidemiology; Human; Professional Burnout; Socialization; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological; Child; Humans; Parents; Socialization","burnout; child; child parent relation; epidemiology; human; professional burnout; socialization; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological; Child; Humans; Parents; Socialization","","","IR and MM were supported by a Coordinated Research Grant from the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles in Belgium (ARC Grant n°19/24-100).

However, numerous studies on RHS's impact on private modes’ usage provide inconclusive evidence. Notably, few studies have analyzed RHS's impacts on modal changes in the context of motorcycle-based societies. This study attempts to identify the critical factors affecting RHS users’ private mode usage (private cars and motorcycles) in response to RHS appearance in Hanoi, Vietnam, a motorcycle-based society. Two empirical analyses were performed with sample data of 642 individuals collected from face-to-face interviews using paper-based questionnaire sheets in Hanoi from December 19 to 21, 2020. The first analysis employed a linear regression model to explain the changes in individuals’ private mode usage before and after RHS adoption. The second analysis estimated a logistic regression model to examine an individual's private mode choice when RHS are unavailable. Robustness tests were also performed. The results revealed that RHS users’ future vehicle ownership intentions, reasons for using RHS instead of private modes, motorcycle ownership, and public transport usage significantly reduce the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. The reasons for using RHS rather than private modes were found not strong enough to make an essential change to reduce the frequency of private modes usage. The results also showed there is a difference between the RHS's impacts on motorcycle use and car use. They suggested that policy makers should be aware of the unique factors in motorcycle-based societies such as Hanoi when formulating urban transportation strategies. Finally, the findings further supported an idea that multivariate analyses are more suitable than the simple descriptive statistics method to understand how the motivation for using RHS influences the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Modal Choice; Motorcycle-based Society; Private Mode; Ride-hailing Service","","","","Funding text 1: This study was financially supported by the Kajima Foundation’s International Joint Research Grant.; Funding text 2: We appreciate Dr. Saksith Chalermpong and Dr. Phathinan Thaithatkul (Chulalongkorn University) for sharing the basic design of the questionnaire survey of ride-hailing services.

A judicious combination of either approach in both classroom pedagogy has long been advocated by both theorists and veteran practitioners. However, the authors, when working as teacher trainers, had observed that many ESP teachers reverted almost wholly to bottom-up approaches in their classroom practices. The present study seeks to understand whether or not this perception is accurate and what justifications and/or explanations might be put forward in favour of adopting either approach in ESP milieus. With the participation of 14 ESP teachers in Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam, the study was conducted using a semi-structured written questionnaire which was followed by an open-ended live interview. Emerging and significant themes were then identified and codified by the authors, utilizing a reflective ethnographic approach. Among the most significant findings were 1) that teachers often failed to apply aspects of their training as language teachers into their own classrooms and 2) that the judicious application of either approach was more often performed unconsciously than as a result of any conscious methodological application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bottom-up/ Top-down Approaches; East Asia; Materials Design; Pedagogy; Teaching Methodology","","","","","English for Specific Purposes, (1977); Shaping Written Knowledge the Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science, (1988); Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication Cognition Culture Power, (1995); Analysing Genre Language Use in Professional Settings, (1993); Bhatia, Vijay K., Integrating products, processes, purposes and participants in professional writing, pp. 21-39, (2014); Charles, Mirjaliisa, Language matters in global communication: Article based on ORA lecture, October 2006, Journal of Business Communication, 44, 3, pp. 260-282, (2007); Bargiela-Chiappini, Francesca, Business English, pp. 193-211, (2012); Developments in English for Specific Purposes, (1998); Feak, Christine B., ESP and Speaking, pp. 35-53, (2012); Flowerdew, John L., Action, content and identity in applied genre analysis for ESP, Language Teaching, 44, 4, pp. 516-528, (2011)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","14751585","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188215315"

Forty-four non-adults (<20 years of age-at-death) were assessed for macroscopic and radiographic evidence for hypomineralization disorders. Differential diagnosis was completed using traditional methods and three-level standardized criteria to combat the challenges of overlapping pathological features between hypomineralization disorder and the other diseases already diagnosed at the site. In addition, a diagnostic certainty approach was applied to investigate the impact of lesion ambiguity on our findings. Kaplan–Meier and Fishers exact tests were applied to assess age-at-death-related epidemiological patterns of hypomineralization disorder and co-morbid relationships with scurvy, thalassemia, and treponemal disease. Almost 50% of the non-adult assemblage presented with evidence for hypomineralization disorder, which was associated with decreased survivorship in childhood. Potential epidemiological relationships between scurvy and hypomineralization disorders, and thalassemia and hypomineralization disorders are described. The former relationship may be due to the likelihood of the introduction of rice resulting in multi-micronutrient deficiency, including vitamin C and calcium deficiency, and cultural attitudes to sunlight. The latter relationship may relate to the pathophysiology of thalassemia that can result in secondary osteomalacia possibly contributing to the development of hypomineralization disorder in the thalassemic non-adults. The findings are significant as they present possible approaches for diagnosis of disease embedded within complex disease burdens where individuals are likely suffering from co-morbidities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Frailty; Micronutrient; Msea; Nutritional Disease; Prehistory; Survivorship; Tropics; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: Permissions for access and publication of the skeletal assemblage were granted by the Institute for Archaeology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2018.

The performance of legal text retrieval depends, to a large extent, on the representation of text, both query and legal documents. Based on good representations, a legal text retrieval model can effectively match the query to its relevant documents. Because legal documents often contain long articles and only some parts are relevant to queries, it is quite a challenge for existing models to represent such documents. In this paper, we study the use of attentive neural network-based text representation for statute law document retrieval. We propose a general approach using deep neural networks with attention mechanisms. Based on it, we develop two hierarchical architectures with sparse attention to represent long sentences and articles, and we name them Attentive CNN and Paraformer. The methods are evaluated on datasets of different sizes and characteristics in English, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Experimental results show that: (i) Attentive neural methods substantially outperform non-neural methods in terms of retrieval performance across datasets and languages; (ii) Pretrained transformer-based models achieve better accuracy on small datasets at the cost of high computational complexity while lighter weight Attentive CNN achieves better accuracy on large datasets; and (iii) Our proposed Paraformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COLIEE dataset, achieving the highest recall and F2 scores in the top-N retrieval task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Neural Networks; Global Attention; Hierarchical Representation; Legal Text Retrieval; Authentication; Deep Neural Networks; Information Retrieval; Natural Language Processing Systems; Text Processing; Document Retrieval; Global Attention; Hierarchical Representation; Legal Documents; Legal Questions; Legal Text Retrieval; Legal Texts; Question Answering; Text Retrieval; Text-processing; Large Dataset","Authentication; Deep neural networks; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Document Retrieval; Global attention; Hierarchical representation; Legal documents; Legal questions; Legal text retrieval; Legal texts; Question Answering; Text retrieval; Text-processing; Large dataset","","","This work was supported by JSPS Kakenhi Grant Number 20K20406.

However, along with their positive contributions, these projects have also brought significant social consequences, particularly for those who have been involuntarily displaced and resettled, including ethnic minorities. To shed light on this issue, this chapter discusses the spatial conditions at A Do village, one of the new resettlement areas where the Cotu ethnic minority residents have been relocated. These communities found themselves uprooted from their ancestral land due to the construction of the A Vuong hydropower plant. The construction of the plant greatly forced significant changes in their lives, and significant alterations in the village layout, housing type, living arrangements, and building materials between the old and new villages have profoundly impacted the locals' way of life. Residents have made necessary adjustments by constructing extensions to their homes and making changes in the utilization of living spaces. The residents' lifestyles and traditions were greatly impacted by the design of their new houses and environment, leading them to compromise to maintain their cultural values and lifestyle. Although the government aimed to provide better infrastructure and amenities, these changes impacted the preservation of Cotu cultural traditions. It is essential to strike a balance between the new development and cultural traditions right from the outset and to incorporate the knowledge and strengths of the residents along with the potential benefits and limitations of the new area. Close and effective communication with the affected communities and actively involving the residents in the planning process for the new living environment are highly important to ensure that their cultural practices and preferences are considered. The focus should be on providing support that builds a foundation for improvement in the future. To protect social capital and prevent the loss of traditions, all parties involved in community relocation projects must carefully consider the local society and culture during the planning and development of the new resettlement areas. The roles of stakeholders are crucial in facilitating the indigenous communities' transition into modernization while preserving their cultural heritage, and an integrated approach is required.

An integrated approach (both qualitative and quantitative analysis, conducted through field and questionnaire surveys) was used in the Karura Forest Reserve, located in the northern central part of Nairobi City. Data sources developed from the questionnaire survey were analyzed via the application of ecological approaches to evaluate different ecosystem services being generated based on the local knowledge generated by the residents living within the forest areas. Results suggested that both local people and rural communities depend on this forest, with indigenous and exotic species contributing to producing various ecosystem services, primarily provision and regulatory services such as food, fodder, fuel, and medicine. These ecosystem services are necessary for livelihood support and keeping forest usage diverse. Moreover, it also contributed to the enhancement of social bonding, peace and happiness, and women’s empowerment by creating more jobs, reducing thefts/crimes, and increasing opportunities for women to take key roles in decision-making. Exotic elements, like Eucalyptus, introduced in the forest reserve provided the stakeholders with benefits owing to their rapid growth. The number of types of forest resource utilization (i.e., use-richness) in indigenous and exotic elements were 10 and 7, respectively. It is still unclear whether the indigenous/native trees adopted in the above-mentioned tree planting activities will bring the same benefits as, or more than, those of exotic species. In consideration of the fact that the prime objective of the reforestation activities is to make local people’s lives more prosperous, it is important to conduct an assessment to clarify the situations of natural resources and the related local needs among the target communities. Then, it is required to properly maintain ecosystem services based on the appropriate local ecological knowledge and to promote well-balanced vegetation management coexisting with indigenous and exotic elements. These findings will contribute to providing forest managers and users with incentives to promote a well-balanced landscape management between indigenous and exotic vegetation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Baral, Himlal, A proposed framework for assessing ecosystem goods and services from planted forests, Ecosystem Services, 22, pp. 260-268, (2016); Green Belt Movement of Kenya with Wanjira Matai, (2015); Eigenbrod, Felix, The impact of projected increases in urbanization on ecosystem services, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 278, 1722, pp. 3201-3208, (2011); Fedele, Giacomo, Reducing risks by transforming landscapes: Cross-scale effects of land-use changes on ecosystem services, PLOS ONE, 13, 4, (2018); Ferreira, Lucianna Marques Rocha, Impact of the Urbanisation Process in the Availability of Ecosystem Services in a Tropical Ecotone Area, Ecosystems, 22, 2, pp. 266-282, (2019); Green Belt Movement Annual Report 2016, (2016); Graydon, Nicola, From tiny seeds, Ecologist, 35, 2, (2005); Green Belt Movement Sharing the Approach and the Experience, (2004); Eco Habitat, (2006); Hunt, Kathleen P., It's More Than Planting Trees, It's Planting Ideas"": Ecofeminist Praxis in the Green Belt Movement, Southern Communication Journal, 79, 3, pp. 235-249, (2014)","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9781040273838; 9781032565354","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213185112"

One of the most significant challenges posed by climate change is the imbalance of water resources availability between the wet and dry seasons. Both flood and drought events increasingly cause harm to human health, damage infrastructure, depleted groundwater aquifers, and impede socioeconomic development of entire rural-urban regions. Improving the resilience capacity of urban areas is seen as a sustainable solution to absorb and retain both rain and flood waters in natural lowlands and artificial reservoirs, combined with ecosystem-based adaptation solutions. Water retention structures are natural or engineered localities to balance the micro-climate, regulate the local water regime, create landscapes, and provide a source of freshwater during extended dry spells. This chapter summarizes lessons learned for water management and planners in adapting urban areas for future climate change. Using Ca Mau City, in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, as a case study, we analyzed trends of increased urban flooding and drought occurrence in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Finally, we propose a range of non-structural and structural solutions to strengthen the city’s overall resilience capacity. It is found that ecosystem-based projects that reduce both flood and drought risk and revive ecosystems are evidently workable and usually cost-effective and could be upscaled more broadly. However, the chief obstacles to implementing such initiatives are typically institutional and regulatory setups like the absence of horizontal and vertical integration in governance and the mono-disciplinary nature of policies and ordinances rather than technical ones. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Alves, Alida, Assessing the Co-Benefits of green-blue-grey infrastructure for sustainable urban flood risk management, Journal of Environmental Management, 239, pp. 244-254, (2019); Alves, Alida, Exploring trade-offs among the multiple benefits of green-blue-grey infrastructure for urban flood mitigation, Science of the Total Environment, 703, (2020); Toward Integrated Disaster Risk Management in Vietnam Recommendations Based on the Drought and Saltwater Intrusion Crisis and the Case for Investing in Longer Term Resilience, (2017); Cities and Climate Change Urban Sustainability and Global Environmental Governance, (2005); Deb, Proloy, Assessment of the impacts of climate change and brackish irrigation water on rice productivity and evaluation of adaptation measures in Ca Mau province, Vietnam, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 125, 3-4, pp. 641-656, (2016); Erban, Laura E., Groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, Environmental Research Letters, 9, 8, (2014); Garschagen, M., Resilience and organisational institutionalism from a cross-cultural perspective: An exploration based on urban climate change adaptation in Vietnam, Natural Hazards, 67, 1, pp. 25-46, (2013); Risky Change Vulnerability and Adaptation Between Climate Change and Transformation Dynamics in can Tho City Vietnam, (2014); Di Giusto, Bruno, Development versus adaptation?

ECG signals, particularly the QRS complex, are vital for monitoring heart activity and detecting arrhythmias. A high-performance, low-power system is essential for diagnosing heart diseases. We present a hardware accelerator using a deep neural network to detect QRS complexes, enhancing energy efficiency. Our algorithm adjusts the number of parallel multipliers, reducing latency without extra hardware. We also developed a new method for the softmax layer that maintains accuracy with less hardware. Our design achieves a sensitivity (Se) of 0.99797 and a positive predictive value (+P) of 0.99936, comparable to the state-of-the-art on the MIT-BIH database. It operates at a maximum frequency of 320 MHz, consuming only 0.11 W, and reduces latency by 50% compared to conventional pipelines.

An intracultural approach is adopted to compare these students’ perceptions with those of their forefathers and those who are living overseas. The findings reveal that today’s Vietnamese business students may not totally agree with their parents and those living abroad about the relevance and applicability of all the norms and values. Nonetheless, most norms and values are still properly regarded since they have strong roots in the history and tradition of the Vietnamese people. Educators can use these norms and values, probably via idioms and famous sayings, to give their students the proper and necessary understanding and mindset about the characteristics of a good business person and the consumer market. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Education; Idioms; Norms; Values; Vietnam","","","","","Amato, Jeffery D., Rule-of-thumb behaviour and monetary policy, European Economic Review, 47, 5, pp. 791-831, (2003); Asimakopoulos, Grigorios, Entrepreneurial intention of engineering students: The role of social norms and entrepreneurial self-efficacy, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 16, (2019); Dictionary of Idioms, (2020); Bailey, Jennifer A., Associations Between Parental and Grandparental Marijuana Use and Child Substance Use Norms in a Prospective, Three-Generation Study, Journal of Adolescent Health, 59, 3, pp. 262-268, (2016); Berger, Rita Gisela, Acculturation of Erasmus students: Using the multidimensional individual difference acculturation model framework, International Journal of Psychology, 54, 6, pp. 739-749, (2019); Bernard, April, Yoruba proverbs as cultural metaphor for understanding management in the Caribbean, International Journal of Cross Cultural Management, 12, 3, pp. 329-338, (2012); Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, (2011); Bobek, Donna D., Analyzing the Role of Social Norms in Tax Compliance Behavior, Journal of Business Ethics, 115, 3, pp. 451-468, (2013); Bobek, Donna D., The social norms of tax compliance: Evidence from Australia, Singapore, and the United States, Journal of Business Ethics, 74, 1, pp. 49-64, (2007); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006)","","Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","9781802202687; 9781802202694","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208295956"

This work is a part of the proposed toolchain for speech analysis in EUCINF (EUropean Cyber and INFormation) project, which is an European project with multiple partners in Europe. In particular, the raw input audio is first transformed into various spectrograms using three transformation methods of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), Wavelet Transform (WT) combined with different auditory-based filters of Mel, Gammatone, linear filters (LF), and discrete cosine transform (DCT). Given the spectrograms, we evaluate a wide range of classification models based on three deep learning approaches. The first approach is to train the spectrograms using our proposed baseline models of CNN-based model (CNN-baseline), RNN-based model (RNN-baseline), C-RNN model (C-RNN baseline). Meanwhile, the second approach is to apply the transfer learning from computer vision models such as ResNet-18, MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-BO, DenseNet-121, SuffleNet-V2, Swint, Convnext-Tiny, GoogLeNet, MNASsnet, and Reg-Net. In the third approach, we leverage the state-of-The-Art audio pre-Trained models of Whisper, Seamless, Speechbrain, and Pyannote to extract audio embed dings from the input spectrograms. Then, the audio embed dings are explored by a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to detect fake or real audio samples. Finally, high-performance deep learning models from these approaches are fused to achieve the best performance. We evaluated our proposed models on ASVspoof 2019 benchmark dataset. Our best ensemble model achieved an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.03, which is highly competitive to top-performing systems in the ASVspoofing 2019 challenge. Experimental results also highlight the potential of selective spectrograms and deep learning approaches to enhance model performance on the task of audio deepfake detection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification Model; Feature Extraction; Items-deepfake Audio; Spectrogram; Benchmarking; Discrete Cosine Transforms; Discrete Fourier Transforms; Discrete Wavelet Transforms; Error Statistics; Image Coding; Image Compression; Image Segmentation; Linear Transformations; Photomapping; Speech Analysis; Speech Enhancement; Audio Detection; Classification Models; European Program; Features Extraction; Information Projects; Item-deepfake Audio; Learning Approach; Learning Models; Performance; Spectrograms; Cosine Transforms","Benchmarking; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete Fourier transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Error statistics; Image coding; Image compression; Image segmentation; Linear transformations; Photomapping; Speech analysis; Speech enhancement; Audio detection; Classification models; European program; Features extraction; Information projects; Item-deepfake audio; Learning approach; Learning models; Performance; Spectrograms; Cosine transforms","","","","Turchet, Luca, The Internet of Sounds: Convergent Trends, Insights, and Future Directions, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 10, 13, pp. 11264-11292, (2023); Turchet, Luca, The Internet of Audio Things: State of the Art, Vision, and Challenges, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 10, pp. 10233-10249, (2020); Wu, Zhizheng, Spoofing and countermeasures for speaker verification: A survey, Speech Communication, 66, pp. 130-153, (2015); Yi, Jiangyan, SceneFake: An initial dataset and benchmarks for scene fake audio detection, Pattern Recognition, 152, (2024); Emofake an Initial Dataset for Emotion Fake Audio Detection, (2023); Asvspoof 2019 Future Horizons in Spoofed and Fake Audio Detection, (2019); Yi, Jiangyan, ADD 2022: THE FIRST AUDIO DEEP SYNTHESIS DETECTION CHALLENGE, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2022-May, pp. 9216-9220, (2022); Audio Deepfake Detection A Survey, (2023); Chen, Nanxin, Robust deep feature for spoofing detection - the SJTU system for asvspoof 2015 challenge, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2015-January, pp. 2097-2101, (2015); Gomez-Alanis, Alejandro, A light convolutional Gru-RNN deep feature extractor for ASV spoofing detection, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2019-September, pp. 1068-1072, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","5th IEEE International Symposium on the Internet of Sounds, IS2 2024","","Erlangen","203257","","9798350366525","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207846547"

Men and women in 15 countries (NTOTAL = 4701) completed self-report measures assessing self-esteem and the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-defeating, and self-enhancing. Each of the country samples had self-esteem averages at or above the midpoint of the scale, but did vary. The samples from Colombia and Serbia had the highest self-esteem values and Russia had the lowest. For all of the country samples, with the exception of Russia, the multiple regression results demonstrated that a greater level of the self-enhancing humor style positively predicted higher self-esteem scores. As the self-enhancing humor style involves improving one’s mood with humor, the results suggest that for the majority of the participants, self-enhancing humor styles also help to increase self-esteem. The results are discussed both within countries and across the samples. In particular, the unique finding that not a self-enhancing humor style but an aggressive humor style predicts self-esteem in the Russian sample is discussed. The chapter ends with a discussion of how humor styles correlate with mental health indicators and how the understanding of humor style profiles are related to well-being across countries adds to the global understanding of individual differences. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Social Science Research Council Bulletin, (1942); Baumeister, Roy F., Does High Self-Esteem Cause Better Performance, Interpersonal Success, Happiness, or Healthier Lifestyles?, Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, 1, pp. 1-44, (2003); World Applied Sciences Journal, (2007); Brown, Jonathon D., The three faces of self-esteem, pp. 1-9, (2013); Burisch, Matthias, Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits, American Psychologist, 39, 3, pp. 214-227, (1984); Chen, Guohai, A comparison of humor styles, coping humor, and mental health between Chinese and Canadian university students, Humor, 20, 3, pp. 215-234, (2007); Erickson, Sarah J., Adolescent humor and its relationship to coping, defense strategies, psychological distress, and well-being, Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 37, 3, pp. 255-271, (2007); Ford, Thomas E., Personality, humor styles and happiness: Happy people have positive humor styles, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 320-337, (2016); Fox, Claire Louise, Longitudinal associations between humor styles and psychosocial adjustment in adolescence, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 377-389, (2016); Studia Psychologiczne, (2011)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783031522871; 9783031522888","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205640381"

Based on data collected from 1380 individuals, a Nested Logit Model (NLM) was proposed to analyze the determinants of users’ acceptability under each access mode option as well as evaluate further impacts of shifts in access mode choice on vehicle-kilometer traveled and emissions. The analysis shows that the availability of access modes might increase UMRT use by 47.83%. While this increase further generates additional vehicle-kilometer traveled due to the increase in park-and-ride users, this is offset overall by the large number of motorcycle users shifting to UMRT. Under the most optimistic scenario, modal integration for transit-access trips leads to an average reduction of 17.7% in net vehicle-kilometer traveled or 14.5% in net CO2 emissions or 10.9% in NOx from private vehicles. Our findings also imply that the introduction of parking fees for bicycling- or motorcycling-access trips, while impactful, does not significantly change UMRT choice. Therefore, the pricing schemes should be a focus of parking planning surrounding stations. Finally, a number of policy suggestions for parking planning and first-mile vehicles are presented. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emissions; First-mile Mode; Modal Integration; Nested Logit Model; Transit-access Trips; Vehicle-kilometer Travelled","","","","","Hess, Daniel Baldwin, Traditional neighborhoods and automobile ownership, Transportation Research Record, 1805, pp. 35-44, (2002); Brookings Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs, (2005); Beimborn, Edward A., Accessibility, connectivity, and captivity: Impacts on transit choice, Transportation Research Record, 1835, pp. 1-9, (2003); Discrete Choice Analysis Theory and Application to Travel Demand, (1985); Bergman, Åsa, Modeling access mode choice for inter-suburban commuter rail, Journal of Public Transportation, 14, 4, pp. 23-42, (2011); Boisjoly, Geneviève, Invest in the ride: A 14 year longitudinal analysis of the determinants of public transport ridership in 25 North American cities, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 116, pp. 434-445, (2018); Chiu, Bingyu, Does mass rapid transit reduce motorcycle travel?

However, the existing literature has primarily underestimated such borrowers’ opinions of these services, especially from a comparative standpoint. In addition, previous studies have also neglected the implications for personal financial and accounting education and assistance, in general, and in Vietnam, in particular. Therefore, this study explored the correlations among motivations, perceived benefits, perceived risks, perceived trust, and customer intentions toward P2P borrowing and pawnbroking in Vietnam. Specifically, this study collected data from 295 and 314 students at a national university in Hanoi. A comparison analysis of the evaluations of the two samples revealed that the students perceived P2P lending to be more favorable. Furthermore, regression analyses suggested that motivation could significantly affect the students’ intentions to use and recommend P2P lending and pawnbroking, although the impacts were more prominent in the P2P model. Perceived risks and trust significantly mediated the association between motivations and intentions; the effects of the former were negative, while these of the latter were positive. Implications for personal finance and accounting education at the undergraduate levels were discussed based on these findings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Education; Finance; Higher Education; P2p Lending; Pawnbroking; Personal Finance And Accounting Education; Stephen Darwin, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Chile; Vietnam","","","","","Agnew, Stephen, Financial literacy and student attitudes to debt: A cross national study examining the influence of gender on personal finance concepts, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 25, pp. 122-129, (2015); Amin, Hanudin, Millennials’ acceptability of tawarruq-based ar-rahnu in Malaysia, International Journal of Ethics and Systems, 38, 3, pp. 510-529, (2022); Angel, Stefan, Smart tools?

The adverse impacts of extreme weather events, particularly drought and water scarcity, have inflicted severe consequences on rice production across diverse regions, imperiling both the livelihoods of farmers and the nation's food security. While international aid is crucial, involving farmers in co-financing irrigation water services is essential for addressing these challenges in the long run. This study employs a blended approach encompassing quantitative and qualitative methodologies to investigate the determinants influencing farmers' willingness to participate in co-financing irrigation water services. Data were meticulously gathered through direct interviews with 289 farmers in An Giang province within the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The findings underscore that the majority of respondents (86.16%) reported encountering water-related stresses in rice production, with 76.47% experiencing productivity losses attributable to extreme weather events. The results of the binary logistic regression model reveal significant factors associated with a farmer's decision to engage in co-financing irrigation services, including household income, participation in non-farm employment, farmers' perceptions of water scarcity, the adverse impact of water scarcity on rice yields, and the assessment of associated risks. Based on these discernments, we offer several policy recommendations aimed at facilitating the efficacious implementation of the irrigation water service co-financing initiative. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-financing Irrigation Services; Mekong Delta; Vietnam; Water Stresses; Willingness To Pay","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 504.05-2020.302.","Agricultural Social Economic Journal, (2022); Akter, Sonia, Household perceptions of climate change and preferences for mitigation action: The case of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in Australia, Climatic Change, 109, 3-4, pp. 417-436, (2011); Estimating Farmers Willingness to Pay for Improved Irrigation an Economic Study of the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme in Northern Ghana, (2012); Antwi-Agyei, Philip, Predictors of access to and willingness to pay for climate information services in north-eastern Ghana: A gendered perspective, Environmental Development, 37, (2021); Arikan, Gizem, Public attitudes towards climate change: A cross-country analysis, British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 23, 1, pp. 158-174, (2021); Bertolini, Guido, One model, several results: the paradox of the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for the logistic regression model., Journal of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, 5, 4, pp. 251-253, (2000); Biswas, Durba, Farmers' Willingness to Pay for Improved Irrigation Water - A Case Study of Malaprabha Irrigation Project in Karnataka, India, Water Economics and Policy, 1, 1, (2015); Bradley, Graham L., The role of climate change risk perception, response efficacy, and psychological adaptation in pro-environmental behavior: A two nation study, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 68, (2020); Brox, James A., Willingness to pay for water quality and supply enhancements in the grand river watershed, Canadian Water Resources Journal, 21, 3, pp. 275-288, (1996); Bui, Nuong Thi, Willingness to Pay for Improved Urban Domestic Water Supply System: The Case of Hanoi, Vietnam, Water (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022)","","Firenze University Press","","","","","","22402802","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197929835"

The percentage of ethnic minorities who have jobs in industry, construction, and services is still limited. Moreover, due to harsh climate conditions, limited resources, poor market access, low education level, lack of investment capital for production, and inadequate policies, job opportunities in the off-farm and non-farm activities are very limited among ethnic minority areas. This paper assessed the contribution of livelihood diversification activities to poverty reduction of ethnic minority households in Son La Province of Vietnam. The analysis was based on the data using three stages sampling procedure of 240 ethnic minority households in Son La Province. The finding showed that the livelihood diversification activities had positively significant contribution to poverty reduction of ethnic minority households in Son La Province. In addition, the factors positively affecting the livelihood choices of ethnic minority households in Son La Province of Vietnam are education level, labor size, access to credit, membership of associations, support policies, vocational training, and district. Thus, improving ethnic minority householder’s knowledge through formal educational and training, expanding availability of accessible infrastructure, and enhancing participation of social/political associations were recommended as possible policy interventions to diversify livelihood activities so as to mitigate the level of poverty in the study area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethnic Minority Households; Factors; Livelihood Diversification; Poverty Reduction; Vietnam","","","","","International Association of Agricultural Economists Iaae 2012 Conference, (2012); Impact of Accessibility on the Range of Livelihood Options Available to Farm Households in Mountainous Areas of Northern Viet Nam, (2002); Ansoms, An, A quantitative analysis of poverty and livelihood profiles: The case of rural Rwanda, Food Policy, 35, 6, pp. 584-598, (2010); Sustainable Livelihoods Lessons from Early Experience, (1999); Barrett, Christopher B., Income diversification, poverty traps and policy shocks in Côte d'Ivoire and Kenya, Food Policy, 26, 4, pp. 367-384, (2001); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2010); Journal of Economics and Sustainable Development, (2017); African Studies, (2003); Poverty Vulnerability and Social Protection in Vietnam Selected Issues, (2011); Baulch, Bob, Decomposing the Ethnic Gap in Rural Vietnam, 1993-2004, Oxford Development Studies, 40, 1, pp. 87-117, (2012)","","EnPress Publisher, LLC","","","","","","25727931; 25727923","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197613008"

Based on a sample of 800 individuals who visited Da Nang, Vietnam between July and August 2023, trends in the barriers and benefits related to bike-sharing service from tourists’ point-of-view were explored. The results show that bike-sharing is appreciated for many reasons, notably for its fun/relaxing, cost saving, ease of city exploration, and promotion of better physical and mental health. However, bike-sharing services are considerably less likely to be viewed as options for faster transportation to a destination or reducing traffic hazards. Notably, eighty-six percent of non-riders indicated contentment with their existing transportation options and a lack of interest in bike-sharing services, a proportion significantly higher than any other group. Predictably, barriers related to the availability of bike-sharing and infrastructure, such as lack of sufficient number of shared bikes, far destination, and poor road conditions were notably more likely to be selected by one-time riders. The results are also evident that a significant portion of tourists is willing to pay to enhance their tourist experience with a bike-sharing service. On average, tourists were willing to pay $0.92 per hour (with a standard deviation of $0.24). This amount reflects the tourists’ recognition of the value added to their mode experience. These findings suggest that bike-sharing service play a significant role in fulfilling an essential transportation niche and have the potential to contribute to enhance tourists’ experience. Efforts aimed at addressing barriers associated with bike-sharing usage could further enhance their contribution to improve tourist satisfaction and boost attraction demand. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Barriers; Benefits; Bike-sharing Service; Tourism Context; Willingness To Pay","","","","","Bai, Lu, Effect of environmental awareness on electric bicycle users’ mode choices, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 82, (2020); Bakogiannis, Efthimios, Monitoring the first dockless bike sharing system in Greece: Understanding user perceptions, usage patterns and adoption barriers, Research in Transportation Business and Management, 33, (2019); Becken, Susanne, Distance Models for new Zealand International Tourists and the Role of Transport Prices, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 3, pp. 303-320, (2011); Economic Benefits of Capital Bikeshare A Focus on Users and Businesses, (2014); Çelebi, Dilay, Bicycle sharing system design with capacity allocations, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 114, pp. 86-98, (2018); Chu, Junhong, The last mile matters: Impact of dockless bike sharing on subway housing price premium, Management Science, 67, 1, pp. 297-316, (2021); Journal of Public Transportation, (2009); Drius, Mita, Tackling challenges for Mediterranean sustainable coastal tourism: An ecosystem service perspective, Science of the Total Environment, 652, pp. 1302-1317, (2019); Durán-Román, José Luis, Tourists' willingness to pay to improve sustainability and experience at destination, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 19, (2021); Fishman, Elliot, Barriers and facilitators to public bicycle scheme use: A qualitative approach, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 15, 6, pp. 686-698, (2012)","","EnPress Publisher, LLC","","","","","","25727931; 25727923","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196917926"

Although private financing schemes, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and land value capture, have been considered intensively, they have yet to produce adequate private capital flows to infrastructure projects due to a lack of incentives for private investors. Against the background, this paper proposes a new financing mechanism in which governments might divert some of the increased tax revenue from the spillover effects of newly constructed infrastructures to fund the private sector through grants or subsidies. The empirical work in Vietnam shows a significant increase in tax revenues after completing two expressways, supporting our idea about spillover effects, which includes small-and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development. This study’s results suggest that spillover effects can bring new opportunities for governments and multilateral development banks (MDBs) to implement infrastructure projects with greater private sector involvement in the region. It also proposes some financial schemes, such as land capture and financing for business startups, including SMEs, to enhance the spillover effects of infrastructure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Infrastructure; Private Financing; Spillover Effect; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors appreciate the valuable comments provided by two anonymous reviewers, Alberto Isgut, Hamza Ali Malik, Oliver Paddison, Tientip Subhanij, Yusuke Tateno and Clevo Wilson that enhance the quality of this paper.

Theoretical framework: The literature about the nighttime economy in developed contexts was reviewed to guide this study. Method/design/approach: Two exploratory studies were implemented. The first one involved the qualitative analysis of user-generated content. The second one was related to an analysis of data gathered via a structured survey. Results and conclusion: The qualitative analysis of public opinions (n = 538) revealed the positive and negative aspects of the perceived impacts. The quantitative survey (n = 352) exposed the hidden elements of the perceived impacts, including the economic, sociocultural, environmental, and health impacts. Research implications: The differences in findings between this study and the prior research were highlighted to expand the literature on the nighttime economy. Implications for local administrators when projecting and managing this new economic activity were also discussed. Originality/value: The binary and multidimensional natures of nighttime economy impacts are simultaneously taken into account to enrich the literature on these particular issues. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Binary; Impacts; Multidimension; Nighttime Economy","","","","","Top Sites in Vietnam, (2021); Anand, Anupam, Pandemic induced changes in economic activity around African protected areas captured through night-time light data, Remote Sensing, 13, 2, pp. 1-15, (2021); Anitha, Sundari, A Balancing Act: Agency and Constraints in University Students’ Understanding of and Responses to Sexual Violence in the Night-Time Economy, Violence Against Women, 27, 11, pp. 2043-2065, (2021); Ashton, Kathryn, Developing a framework for managing the night-time economy in Wales: a Health Impact Assessment approach, Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal, 36, 1, pp. 81-89, (2018); Ayres, Tammy Colleen, Bars, drugs and football thugs: Alcohol, cocaine use and violence in the night time economy among english football firms, Criminology and Criminal Justice, 12, 1, pp. 83-100, (2012); Brands, Jelle, What are you looking at?

However, there remain competing approaches to the governance of low-skilled labor migration; that is, the economic theory and the rights-based approach. By utilizing the labor migration between Vietnam and Japan under the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP), this article reveals the limitations of these two approaches in governing the migration of low-skilled workers. Moreover, through examining the Memorandum of Cooperation on the Technical Intern Training Program signed by the Vietnamese and Japanese governments in 2017 and its contribution to the TITP, this article suggests that to regulate labor migration properly, it is essential to uphold the rights-based approach and consider labor migration as a transnational issue that should be addressed at the international level; that is, through the bilateral or multilateral instruments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","International Law; Japan; Low-skilled Labor Migration; Technical Intern Training Program; Transnational Problem; Vietnam","","","","","Final Report on the Ideal Form of Technical Intern Training Program and Specified Skilled Worker System, (2023); Nihon Rodo Kenkyu Zasshi Japanese Journal of Labour Studies, (2018); Japan Immigration Control Policy Foundation and Transition, (2010); Rupo Ginojisshusei Reportage on Technical Intern Trainees, (2020); Proceedings of the Consultation on Labor Migration from Vietnam to Japan, (2019); International Labor Migration from Vietnam to Asian Countries Process Experiences and Impact, (2010); Saga University Economic Review, (2021); Low Skilled Workers and Bilateral Regional and Unilateral Initiatives Lessons for the Gats Mode 4 Negotiations and Other Agreements, (2008); Return Skilled and Business Migration and Social Transformation, (2002); Labor Migration from Vietnam Issues of Policy and Practice, (2008)","","Brill Academic Publishers","","","","","","19426720; 10752846","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191579431"

Aligned with the SVT framework, these findings emphasize the potential risk of undermining social cohesion when tourism overlooks local realities and norms. This research underscores the significance of adopting a community development perspective, offering insights to assess tourism’s impact on the social fabric.

It focuses on the distinct impacts of motorcycle-based RHS (MRHS) and car-based RHS (CRHS) on user behaviors. By applying multinomial logit and bivariate probit regression analyses to data from 500 RHS users gathered in March 2023, the study reveals that increases in income and personal vehicle ownership have contrasting effects on MRHS and CRHS usage. Notably, MRHS usage is positively associated with employing RHS as a feeder mode to metro stations, while CRHS usage demonstrates a negative correlation. Furthermore, the study establishes a user preference for MRHS over CRHS during peak traffic times. These insights highlight the importance of creating specific policies for different types of RHS, which is vital for the development of successful urban transportation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Country; Motorcycle; Ride-hailing Services; Transport System; Travel Behavior","","","","The interview survey was implemented with financial support from Yokohama National University .

Methods: The study identified 10 RBDBs and employed images in a unique questionnaire survey. Further, permutation tests were employed to compare perceptions of motorcyclists in scenarios involving bus-motorcycle-car flow and bus-motorcycle flow and to compare their perceptions to those of car drivers’. Moreover, heteroskedastic generalized ordered logit regression models were utilized to predict traffic safety perceptions of motorcyclists and car drivers toward RBDBs. Results: High-speed bus driving is perceived as the most dangerous situation, while continuous flashing of lights at vehicles in front is perceived as the least dangerous. The permutation test revealed that motorcyclists tend to perceive RBDBs as less dangerous in bus-motorcycle flow than in mixed flow with cars, while car drivers consider them safer than motorcyclists. The regression model revealed that among the RBDBs, bus moving at high speeds, abruptly overtaking, abruptly changing lanes, and suddenly pulling over at bus stops are perceived as the most dangerous by motorcyclists and car drivers. The study also discusses the relationships between the socio-demographic characteristics of motorcyclists/car drivers and their safety perception toward RBDBs. Conclusions: These findings could inform the development of interventions to reduce RBDBs and improve traffic safety for motorcyclists and car drivers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Car Driver’s Perception; Mixed Traffic Flow; Motorcyclists’ Perception; Risky Bus Driving Behaviors; Traffic Safety; Accident Prevention; Behavioral Research; Bus Drivers; Bus Transportation; Motorcycles; Regression Analysis; Car Driver; Car Driver’s Perception; Driving Behaviour; Mixed Traffic Flow; Motorcyclist’ Perception; Permutation Tests; Questionnaire Surveys; Risky Bus Driving Behavior; Safety Perception; Traffic Safety; Buses; Car; Car Driving; Human; Motor Vehicle; Motorcycle; Prevention And Control; Traffic Accident; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Humans; Motor Vehicles","Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Bus drivers; Bus transportation; Motorcycles; Regression analysis; Car driver; Car driver’s perception; Driving behaviour; Mixed traffic flow; Motorcyclist’ perception; Permutation tests; Questionnaire surveys; Risky bus driving behavior; Safety perception; Traffic safety; Buses; car; car driving; human; motor vehicle; motorcycle; prevention and control; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Humans; Motor Vehicles","","","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science and Technology, Japan, under Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho: MEXT) Scholarships.

Attainment of net zero requires accelerated systemic decarbonization measures to catalyze fundamental changes across multiple societal systems simultaneously. Yet the extant literature has not conceptually clarified conditions leading to accelerated systemic decarbonization in cities. This research therefore aims to: (1) conceptualize strategies that contribute to accelerated systemic decarbonization at the sub-national level and develop a framework for empirically identifying these; and (2) assess the extent to which CAPs in cities known for progressive climate policies embody these characteristics. This involved examination of evidence from CAPs and related documents in six cities: Copenhagen, Leeds, Oslo, San Francisco, Australian Capital Territory and Kyoto. Findings show that San Francisco's climate actions are the most indicative of accelerated systemic decarbonization. In other cities, although many ingredients for accelerated systemic decarbonization are in place, several missed opportunities to achieve more rapid and transformative decarbonization outcomes were identified. These include lack of consideration of scope 3 emissions and limited participatory governance measures as well as absence of economic planning, climate budgets and financial indicators to estimate the benefits or costs of various climate-mitigation actions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accelerated Decarbonization; City Climate Policy; Climate Action Plans; Emission Reduction Measures; Net Zero Targets; Systemic Change; Budget Control; Emission Control; Accelerated Decarbonization; Action Plan; City Climate Policy; Climate Action Plan; Climate Policy; Decarbonisation; Emission Reduction; Emission Reduction Measure; Net Zero Target; Reduction Measures; Systemic Change; Decarbonization; Emission Control; Environmental Planning; Environmental Policy; Mitigation; Australia; California; Copenhagen [(cty) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; England; Honshu; Hovedstaden; Japan; Kinki; Kyoto [kinki]; Kyoto [kyoto (prf)]; Leeds [england]; Leeds [leeds (dst)]; Norway; Oslo [norway]; Oslo [oslo (cnt)]; San Francisco [california]; United Kingdom; United States","Budget control; Emission control; Accelerated decarbonization; Action plan; City climate policy; Climate action plan; Climate policy; Decarbonisation; Emission reduction; Emission reduction measure; Net zero target; Reduction measures; Systemic change; Decarbonization; emission control; environmental planning; environmental policy; mitigation; Australia; California; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; England; Honshu; Hovedstaden; Japan; Kinki; Kyoto [Kinki]; Kyoto [Kyoto (PRF)]; Leeds [England]; Leeds [Leeds (DST)]; Norway; Oslo [Norway]; Oslo [Oslo (CNT)]; San Francisco [California]; United Kingdom; United States","","","Barrett gratefully acknowledges support from the Center for Co*Design and the Center for Global Initiatives at Osaka University.

Here, we examined cross-nationally the structure and correlates of these beliefs with an 8-item scale, using a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. We obtained a two-factor model of unfounded (conspiracy and health) beliefs with good internal structure (average CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04), but a high correlation between the two factors (average latent factor correlation = 0.57). This model was replicable across 50 countries (total N = 13,579), as evidenced by metric invariance between countries (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMS = 0.07) as well as scalar invariance across genders (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03) and educational levels (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03). Also, lower levels of education, more fear of COVID-19, and more cynicism were weakly associated with stronger conspiracy and health beliefs. The study contributes to knowledge about the structure of unfounded beliefs, and reveals the potential relevance of affective (i.e., fear of COVID-19) and cognitive (i.e., cynicism) factors along with demographics, in endorsing such beliefs. In summary, we obtained cross-cultural evidence for the distinctiveness of unfounded conspiracy and health beliefs about COVID-19 in terms of their structure and correlates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conspiracy Beliefs; Covid-19; Cross-cultural; Health Beliefs; Unfounded Beliefs","","","","The work of Magdalena \u017Bemojtel-Piotrowska and Jaros\u0142aw Piotrowski was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland under Grant [2017/26/E/HS6/00282].

This paper presents a more specifically investigating of the seasonal variations in water discharge and sediment load from 1958 to 2021, both before and after the impoundment of all large dam-reservoirs, using daily observations from the Son Tay hydrological gauging station, the outlet of the Red River system and entry to the delta. Sediment loads have decreased progressively since the early 1990s due to sediment yield reduction and dams in the upper basin, with a reduction of about 91% (from 116 × 106 to 11 × 106 t/year) over the 64-year observation period. Prior to the impoundment of the Hoa Binh dam-reservoir in 1988, the hydrological processes in the Red River system exhibited seasonal anomalies (clockwise mode on the hysteresis of rating curve), which implies that sediment load is highly proportional to water discharge and precipitation. The hysteresis loops between mean monthly water discharge and suspended sediment concentration after 1988 were altered by tributary dam-reservoirs and a phenomenon known as ‘temporal monsoon moving’, which shifted the rating curve from clockwise to counterclockwise mode. Our long-term analysis indicates that approximately 57.5% and 79% of sediments were trapped during the periods 1989–2008 (after Hoa Binh dam-reservoir impoundment) and 2009–2021 (a series of new dam-reservoirs went into operation), respectively, primarily during the high-discharge months (June–October). Additionally, we concluded that the contribution of climate components (e.g., rainfall) to the dramatic decline in sediment load of the Red River system was less than the human impact. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dam-reservoir; Red River; Sediment Load; Son Tay; Water Discharge; Clocks; Dams; Hysteresis Loops; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Suspended Sediments; % Reductions; Dam Reservoirs; Rating Curve; Red River; River Systems; Seasonal Variation; Sediment Loads; Son Tay; Water Discharges; Water-sediments; Hysteresis; Dam; Discharge; Reservoir; Seasonal Variation; Sediment Transport; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Red River Delta; Viet Nam","Clocks; Dams; Hysteresis loops; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Suspended sediments; % reductions; Dam reservoirs; Rating curve; Red River; River systems; Seasonal variation; Sediment loads; Son tay; Water discharges; Water-sediments; Hysteresis; dam; discharge; reservoir; seasonal variation; sediment transport; spatiotemporal analysis; Red River Delta; Viet Nam","","","We thank the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) postdoctoral fellowship to N.H.Q (ID No. P22057) and Grant\u2010in\u2010Aid for JSPS Fellows relating to the JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship for Foreign Researchers (Grant number: 22F22057).

Since IWTC-9, we see an emergence of probabilistic TC genesis forecast products by operational centers, typically supported by the statistical processing of a combination of ensemble prediction and satellite analysis, covering time periods of couple of days to weeks ahead. The prevalence of multi-center grand ensemble approach highlights the uncertainties involved and the forecast challenges in quantitative genesis prediction. While operational practice might differ across agencies, verification efforts generally report a steady or slightly improving skill level in terms of reliability, which likely results from the continual improvement in global numerical weather prediction capability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyclogenesis; Ensemble; Forecasting; Global; Operational; Prediction; Probabilistic; Survey; Tropical Cyclone Genesis; Verification; Climate Modeling; Cyclogenesis; Ensemble Forecasting; Probability; Quantitative Analysis; Research Work; Satellite Data; Satellite Imagery; Tropical Cyclone; Weather Forecasting","climate modeling; cyclogenesis; ensemble forecasting; probability; quantitative analysis; research work; satellite data; satellite imagery; tropical cyclone; weather forecasting","","","","Aijaz, Saima, Bias correction of tropical cyclone parameters in the ECMWF ensemble prediction system in Australia, Monthly Weather Review, 147, 11, pp. 4261-4285, (2019); Balaji, M., Changes in tropical cyclone activity in north Indian Ocean during satellite era (1981–2014), International Journal of Climatology, 38, 6, pp. 2819-2837, (2018); Bell, Samuel S., North Indian Ocean tropical cyclone activity in CMIP5 experiments: Future projections using a model-independent detection and tracking scheme, International Journal of Climatology, 40, 15, pp. 6492-6505, (2020); 102nd American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting, (2022); Camp, Joanne, Skilful multiweek tropical cyclone prediction in ACCESS-S1 and the role of the MJO, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 144, 714, pp. 1337-1351, (2018); Chen, Jan–Huey, Evaluation of tropical cyclone forecasts in the next generation global prediction system, Monthly Weather Review, 147, 9, pp. 3409-3428, (2019); Chen, Rui, Machine learning in tropical cyclone forecast modeling: A review, Atmosphere, 11, 7, (2020); Noaa Tech Rep Nesdis 11, (1984); undefined, (2012); Fudeyasu, Hironori, Development conditions for tropical storms over the western north pacific stratified by large-scale flow patter, Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan, 98, 1, pp. 61-72, (2020)","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","25893025; 22256032","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184161151"

However, the effects of past long-term land cover changes on the characteristics of recent landslides remains underexplored. We studied land cover evolution over a 56-year period on Omishima Island in western Japan to examine the spatial relations of landslides in the July 2018 storm event based on rainfall, land cover trajectories, and topography. We generated land cover maps for 1962, 1981, and 2018 by aerial photo interpretation. We also identified 512 new landslides. Based on 47-year precipitation records, we estimated the return periods of 1- to 264-h rainfalls during the storm using the generalised extreme value (GEV) distributions. Return periods showed wide variation when the derived GEV distributions were applied to 1-km grid rainfall distributions. Despite such pronounced spatial variations in rainfall, we did not observe a clear correlation between rainfall intensity and landslide distribution. In contrast, land cover trajectories had a pronounced effect on landslide occurrence. Landslides were more concentrated on slopes that experienced land cover changes after 1962. A comparison of slopes on farmland developed between 1962 and 1981 (mainly citrus orchards) indicated that landslide density and area ratio were significantly lower on slopes that had reverted to forests than on those remaining as farmland. However, the values of the reforested slopes exceeded those of forests and farmlands that remained since before 1962. Our geospatial analysis revealed that even if the field had shifted to forests, the effects of reduced slope stability due to orchard development had remained for at least 37 years. This suggested that the impacts of converting forests to orchards last longer than harvesting in managed plantation forests. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Land Cover Change; Rainfall Return Period; Shallow Landslide; Slope Stability; Antennas; Forestry; Orchards; Rain; Slope Protection; Storms; Topography; Trajectories; Trees (mathematics); Extreme Value Distributions; Generalized Extreme Value; Land Cover; Land-cover Change; Mountainous Regions; Rainfall Return Periods; Return Periods; Shallow Landslide; Spatial Relations; Western Japan; Landslides; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Landslide; Mountain Region; Orchard; Precipitation Intensity; Rainfall; Slope Stability; Spatial Variation; Storm; Japan","Antennas; Forestry; Orchards; Rain; Slope protection; Storms; Topography; Trajectories; Trees (mathematics); Extreme value distributions; Generalized extreme value; Land cover; Land-cover change; Mountainous regions; Rainfall return periods; Return periods; Shallow landslide; Spatial relations; Western Japan; Landslides; land cover; land use change; landslide; mountain region; orchard; precipitation intensity; rainfall; slope stability; spatial variation; storm; Japan","","","This research was funded by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) e-ASIA Joint Research Program (Grant Number JPMJSC18E3), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS, KAKENHI Grant Number JP21H01584), and the Japan Geographic Data Center (JGDC, 20th Research Grant \u201CElucidation of factors causing landslides in the July 2018 storm event based on land use changes since Showa period: a case study on islands in Ehime Prefecture\u201D).","Lambin, Eric F., The causes of land-use and land-cover change: Moving beyond the myths, Global Environmental Change, 11, 4, pp. 261-269, (2001); Rindfuss, Ronald R., Developing a science of land change: Challenges and methodological issues, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101, 39, pp. 13976-13981, (2004); Landslides Processes Prediction and Land Use, (2006); Stokes, Alexia, Ecological mitigation of hillslope instability: Ten key issues facing researchers and practitioners, Plant and Soil, 377, 1-2, pp. 1-23, (2014); Sidle, Roy Carl, A theoretical model of the effects of timber harvesting on slope stability, Water Resources Research, 28, 7, pp. 1897-1910, (1992); Jakob, Matthias, The impacts of logging on landslide activity at Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Catena, 38, 4, pp. 279-300, (2000); Guthrie, R.

It applies the analytic hierarchy process to determine the weights of response actions in functional exercises and uses comparison methods to establish the relationship between the weights of the action types, players’ capability targets, and disaster types. The results indicate that the action type weights change when the disaster type changes, whereas the capability weights within each action type remain constant. In this study, we developed a method to adjust the exercise structure based on response action weights and to optimize the number of injects that represent each action type.

This study describes the types of livelihood adaptations (LAs) that coastal fishers in QN have practiced in response to EWEs and find the varieties in these adaptation strategy choices. In this study, we investigated livelihood adaptation strategies in coastal areas through a household survey and analysis of the collected data using MS Excel. Two sample strategies were used, stratified and random sampling, to select 229 coastal fishers from 11 communes; and data are collected through designed questionnaires. The current study employed statistical disaggregation and comparative methods to analyze coastal fishers’ adaptation strategy choices in QN Province. A range of adaptation strategies were identified consisting of five reactive LAs and eight anticipatory LAs practiced differently by coastal fishers. Among the eight anticipatory LAs, discontinuing production for a certain time is a novel adaptation in QN Province. In addition, a divergence in conducting LAs by production forms was found. On-sand farming and offshore fishers invest in advanced technologies and facilities as adaptive measures. By contrast, fishers who farm in estuaries, lagoons, and nearshore fishing fishers are more likely to change and diversify their jobs. The study’s key findings about livelihood adaptation measures and their differences are significant for improving coastal fisher’s livelihoods in Vietnam. Any efforts at local and national levels in developing mitigation strategies for the impact of EWEs may consider the coastal fisher’s adaptation choices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through the Project for Human Resources Development Scholarship by the Japanese Grant Aid (JDS).

This study aimed to assess the knowledge of common cancers among new-entry health science students in Japan and Vietnam, thereby providing insights for implementing appropriate medical educational interventions. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among new-entry health science students at Hiroshima University, Japan, and the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. A printed predesigned questionnaire consisting of eleven questions was distributed to the participants during the freshmen health screening at the beginning of the academic year to assess their knowledge of cancer. Results: A total of 2,748 new-entry health science students participated in the study, including 394 (14.3%) Japanese students and 2,354 (85.7%) Vietnamese students. Most cancer knowledge levels in Japanese students were significantly higher than those in Vietnamese students (p < 0.001), except for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection awareness. For this understanding, only 14.8% of Japanese students selected the correct answer, which was significantly lower than the 22.4% of Vietnamese students (p = 0.001). Both the Japanese and Vietnamese students had limited knowledge regarding the connection between HPV infection and cancer and the link between estrogen–progestogen menopausal therapy and breast cancer. Additionally, female students had better knowledge about breast, skin, and endometrial cancers than male students. Conclusions: Japanese students generally exhibited higher levels of cancer knowledge than Vietnamese students, except for HPV infection recognition. Both groups had limited knowledge regarding the connection between HPV infection and cancer and the relationship between estrogen–progestogen menopausal therapy and breast cancer. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Common Cancer; Health Science Students; Knowledge; Estrogens; Progestins; Estrogen; Gestagen; Attitude To Health; Breast Tumor; Cross-sectional Study; Epidemiology; Female; Human; Japan; Male; Papillomavirus Infection; Questionnaire; Student; Viet Nam; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-sectional Studies; Estrogens; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Papillomavirus Infections; Progestins; Students; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam","estrogen; gestagen; attitude to health; breast tumor; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; female; human; Japan; male; papillomavirus infection; questionnaire; student; Viet Nam; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Estrogens; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Papillomavirus Infections; Progestins; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","Estrogens; Progestins","The authors would like to thank the medical students of Hiroshima University and University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City who agreed to participate in this study.","Bray, Freddie Ian, The ever-increasing importance of cancer as a leading cause of premature death worldwide, Cancer, 127, 16, pp. 3029-3030, (2021); Cancer Key Facts; Gersten, Omer, The cancer transition in Japan since 1951, Demographic Research, 7, pp. 271-306, (2002); Sung, Hyuna, Global Cancer Statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries, Ca-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 71, 3, pp. 209-249, (2021); Hart, Ruth I., Adolescents and young adults’ (AYA) views on their cancer knowledge prior to diagnosis: Findings from a qualitative study involving AYA receiving cancer care, Health Expectations, 24, 2, pp. 307-316, (2021); Rucińska, Monika, Polish high school students’ knowledge about cancer, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 9, (2021); Elshami, Mohamedraed, Knowledge level of cancer symptoms and risk factors in the Gaza Strip: A cross-sectional study, BMC Public Health, 20, 1, (2020); Jpn J Sch Health, (2014); Jpn J Sch Health, (2014); Sugisaki, Koshu, Cancer understanding among Japanese students based on a nationwide survey, Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine, 19, 6, pp. 395-404, (2014)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","37789373","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173030575"

Although considerable variation in item format exists within each modality, previous research has examined this variation almost exclusively among meaning-recognition item types. This article reports on two exploratory studies, each comparing a fully-contextualized and a non-contextualized meaning-recall variant for one specific testing purpose: coverage-comprehension research. The fully-contextualized test utilized the same 622-word passage in each study. In the non-contextualized tests, target words appeared in short, non-defining sentences; in Study A, the elicited response was a translation of only the target item while in Study B, it was the entire prompt sentence. Scores on the compared tests differed significantly only in Study A. In both studies, the consistency with which the compared item formats yielded the same outcome (correct or incorrect) when the same target word was encountered by the same learner was rather low. The provision of relatively authentic context sometimes seemed to aid lexical inferencing, but other times it increased task difficulty relative to the limited-context formats. These findings suggest that different meaning-recall formats could lead to different conclusions regarding knowledge of specific words, and this could impact coverage-comprehension research findings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contextualized Item Formats; L2 Vocabulary Assessment; L2 Vocabulary Knowledge; Meaning-recall Lexical Knowledge","","","","","Asquith, Steven, An Investigation into the Roles of Guessing and Partial Knowledge in the Vocabulary Size Test, TESL-EJ, 26, 3, (2022); Vocabulary Education and Research Bulletin, (2012); New General Service List, (2013); undefined; International Journal of Internet Science, (2016); Elgort, Irina, Effects of L1 definitions and cognate status of test items on the Vocabulary Size Test, Language Testing, 30, 2, pp. 253-272, (2013); Validity and Reliability, (2013); Reading in A Second Language Moving from Theory to Practice, (2009); Gyllstad, Henrik, Using confidence intervals to determine adequate item sample sizes for vocabulary tests: An essential but overlooked practice, Language Testing, 38, 4, pp. 558-579, (2021); Gyllstad, Henrik, Assessing vocabulary size through multiple-choice formats: Issues with guessing and sampling rates, ITL - International Journal of Applied Linguistics (Belgium), 166, 2, pp. 278-306, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","27727661","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172387135"

Unlike many smart technologies, emotion-recognition systems sense, monitor, harvest and analyze data extracted from a person’s non-conscious or psycho-physical state, often without their knowledge or consent. As a far more invasive manner of surveillance capitalism, the technological adoption of emotional AI is problematized by a myriad of legal, ethical, cultural, and scientific issues. To better understand the behavioral factors determining an individual’s attitude towards this emerging technology, we first identify five major tensions that may impinge on adoption. Second, we extend the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) model with insights from the mindsponge model of information filtering (Vuong and Napier, 2015) along with quantitative affordances offered by the Bayesian computational approach. Our analysis was conducted based on a multi-national dataset surveying perceptions of 1015 young adults (age 18–27) regarding emotional AI applications and their socio-cultural characteristics such as income, region, religiosity, and home country politics. These characteristics are fed into our Bayesian multi-level models as varying intercepts so that we can systematically measure and compare the effects of various behavioral determinants on the attitudes of respondents towards non-conscious data harvesting by government and private sector actors. Critically, this study finds respondents who feel more familiar with, and perceive more utilities in AI technologies, as well as rate themselves as more restrained from heated arguments on social media, feel less threatened by the practice of non-conscious data harvesting by both government and private sector actors. Our findings offer a fertile platform for further exploration of the intersection between psychology, culture, and emotion-recognition technologies as well as important insights for policymakers wishing to ensure design and regulation of the technology serve the best interests of society. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study is part of the project \u201CEmotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life \u201D funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019) (https://www.jst.go.jp/ristex/hite/en/topics/409.html), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6.

The research addresses key questions regarding the speed of Asian states’ involvement in multilateral treaties and their adaptation to these treaties within the United Nations system over time. The approach combines empirical data and conceptualization to ensure a robust evidentiary basis. A dataset comprising 600 major multilateral treaties deposited in the United Nations system, covering diverse global issues, was collected. Additionally, ratification actions from twenty-eight Asian countries were categorized into four sub-regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia. To quantitatively measure states’ engagement with multilateral treaties, the study developed and calculated the Treaty Participation Index for each Asian country and sub-group. In an area predominantly characterized by qualitative research, this paper contributes to the existing literature by providing quantitative and metric findings for comparative analyses of multilateral treaty participation among the four Asian sub-regions, as well as comparisons between Asia and the rest of the world. By analyzing the results, the paper offers an evidence-based assessment of the feasibility of these four regionalisms in Asia, particularly in the context of the transition from international politics to the paradigm of global politics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 506.01-2019.301.","Conventions Treaties and Other Responses to Global Issues in Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems Eolss Developed Under the Auspices of the Unesco, (2004); Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira, Minority game with local interactions due to the presence of herding behavior, Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics, 355, 4-5, pp. 280-284, (2006); Denemark, Robert A., Just scraps of paper?: The dynamics of multilateral treaty-making, Cooperation and Conflict, 43, 2, pp. 185-219, (2008); Frederick, Shane W., Time discounting and time preference: A critical review, Journal of Economic Literature, 40, 2, pp. 351-401, (2002); Glas, Aarie, Understanding Multilateral Treaty-Making as Constitutive Practice, Journal of Global Security Studies, 3, 3, pp. 339-357, (2018); Opendemocracy, (2017); Jia Sipa, (2020); Foreign Affairs, (2002); Development of Global Legislative Politics Rousseau and Locke Writ Global, (2019); undefined, (2023)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164140668"

Parenting is embedded in cultural values, and previous research has shown the role of individualism in PB. In this paper, we reanalyze previously collected data to identify profiles based on the four dimensions of PB, and explore whether these profiles vary across countries’ levels of collectivistic-individualistic (COL-IND) values. Our sample comprised 16,885 individuals from 36 countries (73% women; 27% men), and we used a latent profile approach to uncover PB profiles. The findings showed five profiles: Fulfilled, Not in PB, Low risk of PB, High risk of PB and Burned out. The profiles pointed to climbing levels of PB in the total sample and in each of the three country groups (High COL/Low IND, Medium COL-IND, Low COL/High IND). Exploratory analyses revealed that distinct dimensions of PB had the most prominent roles in the climbing pattern, depending on the countries’ levels of COL/IND. In particular, we found contrast to be a hallmark dimension and an indicator of severe burnout for individualistic countries. Contrary to our predictions, emotional distance and saturation did not allow a clear differentiation across collectivistic countries. Our findings support several research avenues regarding PB measurement and intervention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collectivism; Cultural Values; Individualism; Latent Profile Analyses; Parental Burnout; Adult; Article; Burnout; Climbing; Controlled Study; Cultural Value; Exploratory Research; Female; Human; Human Tissue; Individuality; Major Clinical Study; Male; Prediction","adult; article; burnout; climbing; controlled study; cultural value; exploratory research; female; human; human tissue; individuality; major clinical study; male; prediction","","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under grant FCTUIDB/00050/2020.","Aguiar, Joyce, Parental Burnout and the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Portuguese Parents Experienced Lockdown Measures, Family Relations, 70, 4, pp. 927-938, (2021); Eryılmaz, Günce Sabah, Validation of the Turkish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 15-32, (2020); Aunola, Kaisa, Validity of the Finnish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 61, 5, pp. 714-722, (2020); Bornstein, Marc H., Cultural Approaches to Parenting, Parenting, 12, 2-3, pp. 212-221, (2012); Celeux, Gilles, An entropy criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model, Journal of Classification, 13, 2, pp. 195-212, (1996); Cheng, Huabin, Validation of a Chinese Version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, Frontiers in Psychology, 11, (2020); Furutani, Kaichiro, Exhausted parents in Japan: Preliminary validation of the Japanese version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 33-49, (2020); Gannagé, Myrna, Parental burnout in Lebanon: Validation psychometric properties of the Lebanese Arabic version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 51-65, (2020); Hamvai, Csaba, Parental Burnout in Hungary: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Hungarian Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA-HUN), European Journal of Mental Health, 17, 1, pp. 47-61, (2022); Hansotte, Logan, Are all Burned Out Parents Neglectful and Violent?

As a result, traffic congestion, emissions, and traffic safety have been on the rise. Of particular concern is the significant increase in the number of traffic accidents due to higher traffic volume that is stimulated by economic development and improved households’ economic mobility. During this time frame, many programs, such as traffic safety awareness campaign, have been developed and implemented by transportation agencies to reduce traffic fatalities. This study seeks to understand the long-term effect of policy intervention on traffic fatalities. This is accomplished by developing a log-linear regression model which the response variable is the number of traffic fatalities between 1990 and 2019 and the independent variables include Human Development Index (HDI), motorcycle ownership, and policy interventions. The model estimation results indicate that: (1) a higher degree of economic development (HDI) corresponds to lower traffic fatalities, (2) the motorcycle helmet law has lowered the number of annual traffic fatalities since its enactment, and (3) a higher number of motorcycle trips corresponds to a higher number of traffic fatalities. Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that transportation agencies in Vietnam develop and promote an alternative transportation mode. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human Development Index; Motorcycle Ownership; Traffic Fatality; Transporation Policy Intervention; Accident Prevention; Economic And Social Effects; Motor Transportation; Regression Analysis; Traffic Congestion; Economic Development; Human Development Index; Motorcycle Ownerships; Policy Intervention; Road Traffic Fatalities; Traffic Fatalities; Traffic Safety; Transporation Policy Intervention; Transportation Agencies; Viet Nam; Motorcycles","Accident prevention; Economic and social effects; Motor transportation; Regression analysis; Traffic congestion; Economic development; Human development index; Motorcycle ownerships; Policy intervention; Road traffic fatalities; Traffic fatalities; Traffic safety; Transporation policy intervention; Transportation agencies; Viet Nam; Motorcycles","","","","Abbas, Alaa K., Does wearing helmets reduce motorcycle-related death?

The paper responds to this inconclusiveness with a study of the existential indefinite constructions in four mainland Southeast Asian languages, namely Thai, Lao, Vietnamese, and Khmer.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that regular paper-based records are vulnerable to both physical destruction and the act of fabrication, while standard databases can have security holes. Moreover, the process of manually gathering physical papers from centralized organizations is both laborious and complicated. To address the concerns above and foster sustainability in the field of education, this study first suggests using Scorechain. This innovative solution integrates blockchain technology into a comprehensive data-management system for managing all student-related data. Secondly, by utilizing the inherent security features of blockchain technology, Scorechain develops a stable multi-role hierarchy, increasing the integrity and reliability of data. This also facilitates the efficient transfer of information among various stakeholders, including parents, recruiters, and educational institutions, thus fostering transparency and accountability. Lastly, the Scorechain system facilitates collaboration and data exchange among universities inside a shared network. Scorechain was constructed using the Rust programming language and is based on the Substrate blockchain architecture. It underwent careful development, testing, and analysis to ensure operational efficiency. The feasibility and long-term viability of Scorechain in genuine educational contexts are highlighted as blockchain technology facilitates seamless integration into the education sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Education 4.0; Smart Campus; Sustainable Education; Connectivity; Education; Institutional Framework; Stakeholder; Sustainability; University Sector","connectivity; education; institutional framework; stakeholder; sustainability; university sector","","","","Well Being of Nations the Role of Human and Social Capital, (2001); Putro, Prasetyo Adi Wibowo, An Authentic and Secure Printed Document from Forgery Attack by Combining Perceptual Hash and Optical Character Recognition, pp. 157-162, (2019); Grolleau, Gilles, An introduction to the economics of fake degrees, Journal of Economic Issues, 42, 3, pp. 673-694, (2008); Diploma and Accreditation Mills New Trends in Credential Abuse, (2011); Proceedings of 1st Ercim Blockchain Workshop 2018, (2018); Malsa, Nitima, Framework and smart contract for blockchain enabled certificate verification system using robotics, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 960, pp. 125-138, (2021); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Von-Eitzen-Delgado, Christian, Blockchain applications in education: A systematic literature review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 24, (2021); Zhao, Mao, Blockchain in Online Learning: A Systematic Review and Bibliographic Visualization, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 2, (2023); Arndt, Timothy, Blockchain-based transcripts for mobile higher-education, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10, 2, pp. 84-89, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185924009"

Compared to tests employing single-word or limited-context prompts, research suggests that contextualized assessment is more reliable and demonstrates better concurrent validity. In meaning-recall vocabulary assessment, examinees retrieve target-word meaning from memory and typically demonstrate knowledge via a written L2-to-L1 translation. Compared to multiple-choice formats, meaning-recall yields more reliable data, correlates more strongly with reading comprehension, and is less influenced by guessing and test strategies. To facilitate these approaches to vocabulary assessment, this article introduces a resource for teachers and researchers to create, administer, and mark contextualized meaning-recall tests. Users input a passage, select target items, and share the test URL with examinees. Examinees then provide L1 translations or L2 synonyms, definitions, or explanations of target words in input boxes below the lines of text.

A new management method, namely alternative wetting and draining (AWD) (i.e., flooding whenever surface water levels decline to 15 cm below the soil surface), is an emerging practice developed to mitigate CH<inf>4</inf> emissions while providing an optimal solution for freshwater scarcity. Despite extensive paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka, no systematic research study has been conducted to investigate CH<inf>4</inf> emissions under different water management practices. Thus, field experiments were conducted in Sri Lanka to investigate the feedback of controlled water management on seasonal and diel variation of CH<inf>4</inf> emission, water consumption, and crop productivity. Adopting the same rice variety, two water management methods, continuous flooding (CF) and alternative wetting and draining (AWD), were compared with plants (W/P) and without plants (N/P) present. The emission of CH<inf>4</inf> was measured using the static closed chamber method. The results show a 32% reduction in cumulative CH<inf>4</inf> emission, on average, under AWD when compared to CF. The yield under the AWD was slightly higher than that of CF. Although it was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) there was not any reduction in yield in AWD than in CF. The total water saving under AWD ranged between 27–35% when compared to CF. Thus, the results support (without considering the effect of nitrous oxide) AWD as a promising method for mitigating CH<inf>4</inf> emissions while preserving freshwater and maintaining grain yield in paddy systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative Wetting And Draining; Continuous Flooding; Crop Yield; Methane; Water Consumption; Crops; Ecosystems; Floods; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrogen Oxides; Surface Waters; Water Conservation; Water Levels; Water Management; Wetting; Alternative Wetting And Draining; Ch 4; Continuous Flooding; Crop Yield; Floodings; Management Method; Paddy Cultivation; Paddy Ecosystems; Water Consumption; Waters Managements; Methane; Crop Yield; Cultivation; Diel Variation; Flooding; Methane; Rice; Water Management; Wetting; Sri Lanka","Crops; Ecosystems; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water levels; Water management; Wetting; Alternative wetting and draining; CH 4; Continuous flooding; Crop yield; Floodings; Management method; Paddy cultivation; Paddy ecosystems; Water consumption; Waters managements; Methane; crop yield; cultivation; diel variation; flooding; methane; rice; water management; wetting; Sri Lanka","","","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this research from the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research under the project reference number \u201CCRRP2020-07MY-Deepagoda\u201D.

Following the Great East Japan Earthquake and its aftermath, the Japanese central government introduced several policies aimed at reducing public sector salaries at the local government level, and local governments responded by reducing their employees’ salaries. This study empirically tests the existence of strategic interaction in relation to public sector salary setting among municipal governments in response to central government policies. Using a sample of Japanese municipalities from 2010 to 2016, we developed a spatial model that incorporates both spatial autoregressive disturbances and spatial dependencies. A quasi-experimental strategy was used to solve the endogeneity problem of the spatial lag-dependent variable. We found that changes in salary levels in Japanese municipalities are dependent on the salaries in neighboring municipalities. Several estimation methods were used and produced consistent results. Our study also suggested that yardstick competition could drive strategic interaction in relation to decision making regarding salaries. Moreover, when the central government’s top-down policy is effective, the strategic interactions in public salary settings among neighboring municipalities appear to be strong. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Earthquake Damage; Endogenous Growth; Hazard Management; Local Government; Natural Hazard; Public Sector; Public Service; Strategic Approach; Japan","earthquake damage; endogenous growth; hazard management; local government; natural hazard; public sector; public service; strategic approach; Japan","","","Funding text 1: We are grateful to Prof. Hiroki Tanaka and participants at the 2021 Spring Meeting of the Japanese Economic Association and the 2021 Spring Meeting of the Japanese Association for Applied Economics for useful comments and suggestions.

Composting has demonstrated its practicality and feasibility for addressing this issue; however, the lack of at-source solid waste separation remains a major challenge. As a result, in this study, the first sustainable MSW separation at source was conducted in Tan An City, Long An Province. The objective of this study was to evaluate the compost process and quality using Tan An City’s separated biodegradable organic solid waste as the raw material, through a windrow composting process with active aeration. Biodegradable organic waste, slow-biodegradable organic waste and plastic waste accounted for 84.5%, 15.1% and 0.4%, respectively, of the total waste. The pH, moisture, volatile solid percentage, total nitrogen, total organic carbon and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the separated solid waste were 8.7 ± 0.4, 76.8 ± 1.9%, 68.3 ± 1.3%, 2.1 ± 0.1%, 35.7 ± 2.2% and 17 ± 0.8, respectively. Rice straw was mixed with solid waste as a bulking material in a 31%:69% ratio to achieve a moisture content of 55% in the mixture. After 10 weeks, an evaluation of the compost’s quality revealed its potential suitability for agricultural applications. Notably, Salmonella was not detected in the compost, and the heavy metal levels were below standard limits, indicating the safety of the compost. To ensure optimal nutrient levels for effective plant growth, a slight nitrogen and phosphorus supplement was recommended. Aligned with the C/N ratio of 12.1 and a consistent temperature of approximately 29 °C, this indicates a high degree of maturity and stability in the composting process.

A multi-disciplinary approach is used, including the entropy method, field surveys, and GIS combined with interviews with local officials, coastal communities. For analyzing household vulnerability for 457 households in twelve selected communes in Soc Trang province, VMD, we applied the Livelihood Vulnerable index (LVI) and LVI-IPCC indices, and the weight of key components was determined using Shannon's entropy approach. Both are salinity intrusion-focused and the subcomponents of the LVI and LVI-IPCC were similar; nevertheless, they are each conceptually constructed differently, resulting in distinct final value outputs. The results produced from LVI revealed that Lich Hoi Thuong had the highest vulnerability index (0.608), followed by Tran De (0.443) and Dai An 2 (0.435), having moderate vulnerability, whereas the Phu Huu (0.389), Tan Hung (0.341), Long Phu (0.337), Long Duc (0.322), Truong Khanh (0.318), Chau Khanh (0.277), Dai Ngai (0.260), Hau Thanh (0.244) and Lieu Tu (0.224) communes were classified as having low vulnerability. In terms of the results of LVI-IPCC, Lieu Tu (−0.013) is the most vulnerable. Our analysis underlines that, while some communes are vulnerable to saline intrusion, the sensitivity can be mitigated by their adaptive ability. This study has detailed the picture of livelihood vulnerability in Soc Trang, providing valuable information for the decision-makers to understand the context in study areas and then suggest effective strategies to adapt to salinity intrusion. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Capacity; Coastal Communities; Entropy Method; Exposure; Livelihood Vulnerability; Salinity Intrusion; Vietnamese Mekong Delta","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the JSPS RONPAKU (dissertation Ph.D.) program.

Our analysis relied on the data of 3,512 agricultural cooperatives collected in 2021 from Vietnam. We addressed the endogeneity issue of internet use in impact assessment by employing an instrumental variable approach. Our results show that female leadership was positively and significantly associated with internet use and that internet use had a positive and significant effect on returns on assets, returns on equity, labor productivity, payment per laborer, contribution to labor union and insurance per laborer, and innovation in products of agricultural cooperatives. In addition, unconditional quantile regressions show that internet use in agricultural cooperatives exacerbated income inequality.

To achieve the goal of popularizing OF, besides encouraging the participation of newcomers, the government should also focus on farmers already involved because their production decisions are the most effective means for communication. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated smallholder farmer intentions to scale up organic rice farming (ORF). Data were obtained through direct interviews with 325 farmers in the Phu Vang, Phong Dien and Huong Thuy Districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The results revealed the ineffectiveness in demographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, number of laborers, OF experience, percentage of organic rice area, non-farm jobs and involvement in community-based organizations to predict farmer intentions to expand ORF. The findings highlighted the more significant influence of factors related to economic outcomes, farmer awareness of OF, and their confidence in the market outlook.

Unlike information retrieval for general texts, this task is more complex with two phases (legal case retrieval and legal case entailment) and much harder due to a number of reasons. First, both the query and candidate cases are long documents consisting of several paragraphs. This makes it difficult to model with representation learning that usually has restriction on input length. Second, the concept of relevancy in this domain is defined based on the legal relation that goes beyond the lexical or topical relevance. This is a real challenge because normal text matching will not work. Third, building a large and accurate legal case dataset requires a lot of effort and expertise. This is obviously an obstacle to creating enough data for training deep retrieval models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called supporting model that can deal with both phases. The underlying idea is the case–case supporting relation and the paragraph–paragraph as well as the decision-paragraph matching strategy. In addition, we propose a method to automatically create a large weak-labeling dataset to overcome the lack of data. The experiments showed that our solution has achieved the state-of-the-art results for both case retrieval and case entailment phases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Case Law Retrieval; Deep Learning; Information Retrieval; Legal Case Matching; Weak Labeling; Deep Learning; Large Dataset; Learning Systems; Case Law; Case Law Retrieval; Case Matching; Case Retrieval; Labelings; Learning Approach; Legal Case; Legal Case Matching; Weak Labeling; Information Retrieval","Deep learning; Large dataset; Learning systems; Case law; Case law retrieval; Case matching; Case retrieval; Labelings; Learning approach; Legal case; Legal case matching; Weak labeling; Information retrieval","","","This work was supported by JSPS Kakenhi Grant nos. 20H04295, 20K20406, and 20K20625.

While the literature is rich with studies on coconut-related export competitiveness and readiness, it seems that studies focused on a single set of factors, and very few studies take Vietnam as a case study for analysis. Studies we found use aggregate data for econometric analysis. On the contrary, this study attempts to address the literature’s gaps by proposing a comprehensive view of key factors identifying the export potential of bottled coconut water. It also adds to our comprehension of how large- and small-scale manufacturers prioritize factors differently. To answer the research questions, we collect qualitative and quantitative data for analysis. We use AHP and M-CRITIC-RP methods for ranking the factors.

We aimed to evaluate the global short-term mortality risk and burden associated with tropical cyclones from 1980 to 2019. Methods: The wind speed associated with cyclones from 1980 to 2019 was estimated globally through a parametric wind field model at a grid resolution of 0·5° × 0·5°. A total of 341 locations with daily mortality and temperature data from 14 countries that experienced at least one tropical cyclone day (a day with maximum sustained wind speed associated with cyclones ≥17·5 m/s) during the study period were included. A conditional quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model was applied to assess the tropical cyclone–mortality association. A meta-regression model was fitted to evaluate potential contributing factors and estimate grid cell-specific tropical cyclone effects. Findings: Tropical cyclone exposure was associated with an overall 6% (95% CI 4–8) increase in mortality in the first 2 weeks following exposure. Globally, an estimate of 97 430 excess deaths (95% empirical CI [eCI] 71 651–126 438) per decade were observed over the 2 weeks following exposure to tropical cyclones, accounting for 20·7 (95% eCI 15·2–26·9) excess deaths per 100 000 residents (excess death rate) and 3·3 (95% eCI 2·4–4·3) excess deaths per 1000 deaths (excess death ratio) over 1980–2019. The mortality burden exhibited substantial temporal and spatial variation. East Asia and south Asia had the highest number of excess deaths during 1980–2019: 28 744 (95% eCI 16 863–42 188) and 27 267 (21 157–34 058) excess deaths per decade, respectively. In contrast, the regions with the highest excess death ratios and rates were southeast Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. From 1980–99 to 2000–19, marked increases in tropical cyclone-related excess death numbers were observed globally, especially for Latin America and the Caribbean and south Asia. Grid cell-level and country-level results revealed further heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns such as the high and increasing tropical cyclone-related mortality burden in Caribbean countries or regions. Interpretation: Globally, short-term exposure to tropical cyclones was associated with a significant mortality burden, with highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns. In-depth exploration of tropical cyclone epidemiology for those countries and regions estimated to have the highest and increasing tropical cyclone-related mortality burdens is urgently needed to help inform the development of targeted actions against the increasing adverse health impacts of tropical cyclones under a changing climate.

Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model on multiple cross-sectional data sets derived from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) of 2004–2016 and follows a consistent two-step procedure to deal with the zero consumption issue. The estimated demand elasticities are then compared and analyzed over time. Findings: The empirical results show that in the last decade, meat consumption patterns in Vietnam have undergone a remarkable structural change, with poultry and beef increasingly taking important roles in the meat consumption structure of households. In addition, demographic characteristics, including settlement type, household size and the age of the household head, have significantly influenced meat expenditure patterns in Vietnam. Research limitations/implications: The paper considers the demand for meat consumed at home but not meat consumed away from home. Originality/value: In many developing countries, increased disposable income, together with rapid urbanization and international integration, has significantly changed consumers' food consumption behaviors. This is one of the first studies using household survey data, which permits the exploration of heterogeneous preferences between consumers, to explore structural changes in food consumption patterns in Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bootstrap; Censoring; Livestock Sector; Meat Consumption; Restructuring; Structural Changes; Sustainable Development; Vietnam","","","","","Jabarin, Amer S., Estimation of meat demand system in Jordan: An almost ideal demand system, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 29, 3, pp. 232-238, (2005); Banks, James, Quadratic engel curves and consumer demand, Review of Economics and Statistics, 79, 4, pp. 527-538, (1997); Bi̇lgi̇ç, Abdulbaki, Household food demand in Turkey: A two-step demand system approach, Food Policy, 43, pp. 267-277, (2013); Bronnmann, Julia, Efficiency of correction for sample selection in QUAIDS models: an example for the fish demand in Germany, Empirical Economics, 57, 4, pp. 1469-1493, (2019); Cashin, Paul A., A MODEL OF THE DISAGGREGATED DEMAND FOR MEAT IN AUSTRALIA, Australian Journal of Agricultural Economics, 35, 3, pp. 263-283, (1991); American Economic Review, (1980); Food Agriculture and the Environment Discussion Paper 28, (1999); Delport, Marion, Evaluating the demand for meat in South Africa: an econometric estimation of short term demand elasticities, Agrekon, 56, 1, pp. 13-27, (2017); Eales, James S., Simultaneity and structural change in u.S. meat demand, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 75, 2, pp. 259-268, (1993); Faharuddin, Faharuddin, Nutrient elasticities of food consumption: the case of Indonesia, Journal of Agribusiness in Developing and Emerging Economies, 7, 3, pp. 198-217, (2017)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","20440839; 20440847","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126763586"

Particularly, the identification of bioactive compounds was confirmed using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (1H and 13C). Momilactone A (MA) and momilactone B (MB) amounts were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC–ESI-MS), whereas other compounds were quantified by spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Accordingly, GBR under B2 treatment (75 mM salinity for 4 days) showed the greatest total phenolic and flavonoid contents (14.50 mg gallic acid and 11.06 mg rutin equivalents, respectively, per g dry weight).

This knowledge gap presents challenges for identifying at-risk individuals and communities and could impede effective public policy and resource allocation for adaptation efforts. To address this issue, this study employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index referencing IPCC definitions (LVI-IPCC) framework to examine livelihood vulnerability and its determinants among 455 small-scale households in the coastal areas of Phu Vang district, Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. The LVI-IPCC calculation utilized a database of 11 major and 33 sub-indicators collected through a household survey conducted in 2021. The findings revealed that these households exhibit moderate vulnerability to natural disasters and climate shocks, as reflected by their high sensitivity index scores. Additionally, the study identified a persistent cycle of poverty and livelihood vulnerability among coastal communities, wherein poverty and reliance on nature-based income serve as the root cause of the exposure and a gateway to this loop. This study strongly advocates for a pro-poor approach that places poverty alleviation at the forefront of community development planning and climate change agendas.

It also examined the factors associated with students’ speaking skills, their motives for studying Japanese, and their needs for communication with native Japanese speakers while proposing a hypothetical model linking these constructs. A total of 108 students participated in the cross-sectional online survey questionnaire, which included questions on personal information, perceived Japanese language skills, motives for studying Japanese, needs for communication with native Japanese speakers, and self-esteem. The data were analyzed using SPSS. The results showed that the respondents perceived their Japanese speaking skills level as lower than the other three skills. Factors such as age, year of enrollment, years studying Japanese, English level, co-living status, study abroad experience, and self-esteem were found to be associated with the perceived speaking skills of the respondents. Family-related factors, such as parents’ education and the family’s study abroad experience, were also found to be associated with perceived speaking skills. The study also validated three constructs of motives for studying Japanese, including being interested in Japan, being interested in communication, and being interested in going to Japan and highlighting the respondents’ needs for communication with native speakers. The proposed model suggests that motives for studying Japanese influence perceived speaking skills and the need for communication with native Japanese speakers. The findings of this study have implications for Japanese language education, particularly in the development of teaching strategies that enhance students’ speaking skills and provide opportunities for communication with native speakers. It also underscores the importance of understanding students’ motives for studying Japanese, as these motivations can influence their language proficiency and the effectiveness of language education programs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Communication; Japanese Language; Native Japanese Speaker; Speaking Skills","","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP20K02610.","Overseas Japanese Language Education Institution Survey 2021 Results, (2021); de Burgh-Hirabe, Ryoko, Motivation to learn Japanese as a foreign language in an English speaking country: An exploratory case study in New Zealand, System, 80, pp. 95-106, (2019); Huang, Wenhong, Exploring the dynamics of motivation for learning Japanese among Chinese learners: an elicited metaphor analysis, Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 40, 7, pp. 605-617, (2019); Izumi, (2020); Japanese Language Education Around the Global, (1998); Integr Sci Glob Soc Stud, (2020); Journal of Japanese Language Teaching, (2010); Bull Cent Int Educ Hitotsubashi Univ, (2011); Japanese Language Education; Icu Jpn Lang Educ Res, (2014)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277102","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163737455"

An assessment of both the implications and potential etiology of cribra orbitalia in this specific population is carried out. Methods: The effective sample included 141 adults aged ≥15 years (53 females, 71 males, and 17 unknown sex) and 15 pre-adults aged ≤14 years. Cribra orbitalia was identified by way of cortical bone porosity of the orbital roof initiated within the diplöic space, rather than initiated subperiosteally. The approach is also robust to the misidentification of various pseudo-lesions. Resultant data was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Results: Median survival is higher in adults aged ≥15 years without cribra orbitalia than those with this lesion. For the pre-adult cohort, the opposite pattern is seen where median survival is higher in those with cribra orbitalia than those without. Conclusion: Adults displayed increased frailty and pre-adults increased resilience with respect to cribra orbitalia. The differential diagnosis for a survival analysis of adults and pre-adults with and without cribra orbitalia included iron deficiency anemia and B12/folate deficiency, parasitism (including hydatid disease and malaria) in addition to thalassemia. The most parsimonious explanation for observed results is for both thalassemia and malaria being the chief etiological agents, while appreciating these conditions interact with, and can cause, other forms such as hematinic deficiency anemias. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anemia; Hunter-gatherers; Malaria; Paleoepidemiology; Southeast Asia; Thalassemia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Article; B12 Deficiency; Bone Disease; Child; Clinical Feature; Cribra Orbitalia; Differential Diagnosis; Echinococcosis; Female; Frailty; Human; Iron Deficiency Anemia; Major Clinical Study; Malaria; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factor; Survival Rate; Thalassemia; Viet Nam; Epidemiology; Orbit; Pathology; Anemia, Iron-deficiency; Female; Humans; Male; Orbit; Vietnam","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; B12 deficiency; bone disease; child; clinical feature; cribra orbitalia; differential diagnosis; echinococcosis; female; frailty; human; iron deficiency anemia; major clinical study; malaria; male; middle aged; risk factor; survival rate; thalassemia; Viet Nam; epidemiology; orbit; pathology; Anemia, Iron-Deficiency; Female; Humans; Male; Orbit; Vietnam","","","Grant sponsors: Australian Research Council DP110101097, FT120100299.","Adam, Ishag I., Anemia, Iron Supplementation and Susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum Malaria, eBioMedicine, 14, pp. 13-14, (2016); Allen, Lindsay Helen, How common is vitamin B-12 deficiency? 1-3, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 89, 2, (2009); Alvarez-Uria, G., Prevalence and severity of anaemia stratified by age and gender in rural India, Anemia, 2014, (2014); Anstey, Nicholas M., The pathophysiology of vivax malaria, Trends in Parasitology, 25, 5, pp. 220-227, (2009); Antinori, Spinello, Non-human primate and human malaria: Past, present and future, Journal of Travel Medicine, 28, 5, (2021); Arlappa, Nimmathota, Prevalence of anaemia among rural pre-school children of West Bengal, India, Annals of Human Biology, 37, 2, pp. 231-242, (2010); Bland, John Martin Artin, Statistics notes: The logrank test, BMJ, 328, 7447, (2004); Blondiaux, Joël, Tuberculosis and survival in past populations: A paleo-epidemiological appraisal, Tuberculosis, 95, S1, pp. S93-S100, (2015); Trials, (2011); Brabin, Bernard J., An analysis of anemia and child mortality, Journal of Nutrition, 131, 2 SUPPL. 2, (2001)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","26927691","","","37009914","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151933273"

Since the evolution of sand spits along coastlines influence the social-economic development of local coastal areas, sand spits have become the objects of numerous studies. However, previous studies have mainly focused on sand spits that are usually in the scale of hundreds of meters in width, whilst knowledge about the evolution of smaller-scale sand spits still remains limited. Therefore, in this study, the morphological change of a small and unexplored sand spit in front of Song Tranh Inlet on the west coast of Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam is investigated. Satellite images are first used to observe the morphological change of the sand spit and calculate the longshore sediment transport rates (LSTR) along the sand spit. Waves and beach sediments are collected at the study site to calculate the longshore sediment transport rate using the CERC formula. It is found that there is a seasonal variation in the evolution of the sand spit at Song Tranh Inlet. The longshore sediment transport rates along the spit calculated by image analysis are 39,000 m3/year, 66,000 m3/year, and 40,000 m3/year, whilst the longshore sediment transport rate calculated by the CERC formula is 72,000 m3/year. This study aims to contribute to the methodology for investigating the evolutions of small sand spits and, specifically, sustainable coastal management for Phu Quoc Island, which is well-known as the Pearl Island of Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Longshore Sediment Transport; Morphological Evolution; Phu Quoc; Sand Spit; Sentinel; Coastal Engineering; Economic And Social Effects; Landforms; Sand; Sediment Transport; Sedimentation; Coastal Landforms; Longshore Sediment Transport; Morphological Changes; Morphological Evolution; Phu Quoc; Sand Spits; Sediment Transport Rate; Sentinel; Tidal Inlet; Viet Nam; Morphology; Coastal Zone Management; Evolution; Image Analysis; Seasonal Variation; Sediment Transport; Spit; Phu Quoc Island","Coastal engineering; Economic and social effects; Landforms; Sand; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Coastal landforms; Longshore sediment transport; Morphological changes; Morphological evolution; Phu quoc; Sand spits; Sediment transport rate; Sentinel; Tidal inlet; Viet Nam; Morphology; coastal zone management; evolution; image analysis; seasonal variation; sediment transport; spit; Phu Quoc Island","","","","Teodoro, Ana C., Extraction of Cabedelo sand spit area (Douro estuary) from satellite images through image processing techniques, Journal of Coastal Research, SPEC.

A large-scale quantitative approach was applied with a national survey in the midst of the fourth wave of Covid-19 outbreak in Vietnam. The research obtained data from 2252 students from various universities in Vietnam. Results showed that experienced positive affect and negative affect fully mediated the relationships between students’ self-emotion appraisal and their resilience during the pandemic. Surprisingly, other-emotion appraisal decreased positive affect while increased negative affect, though both affect types mediated the other-emotion appraisal-resilience relationship. The two types of affects also played mediating roles in the relationship between the ability of using emotion and resilience among students during the crisis, and the moderation was partial. Finally, while students’ regulation of emotion was not related to either their experienced negative affect or resilience, it was indirectly associated with students’ resilience during the pandemic via the mediating role of positive affect.

To this end, ICN (Information-Centric Networking), which implements the innovative ideas of in-network caching and named content as the communication identifier instead of IP address as in TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, the standard Internet protocol suite), has been among the most promising future Internet (FI) designs to solve most of the conventional IP-based network architecture. However, ICN also consumes higher energy than TCP/IP design as extra power is required for enabling in-network caching capability. Hence, this energy efficiency (EE) issue needs to be addressed so that ICN can be a feasible and practical FI architecture for highly efficient yet sustainable network infrastructure deployment. This chapter then presents and investigates the performance of a novel ""green"" FI prototype, termed as Green ICN, for the realization of a scalable and sustainable real-world network infrastructure toward future networks. Specifically, the Green ICN system efficiently switches network node links and tunes content providers/servers' optimized operating mode to save considerable power while meeting network traffic load with required (high) network performance, especially in the case of low traffic with light underutilization periods. To further diminish the overall network system's power consumption, a popularity-aware caching scheme is implemented by setting higher priorities for serving more ""popular"" content items. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Internet; Future Communication Networks; Green Networking; Information And Communications Technology (ict); Network Design; Sustainable Network Solutions","","","","","Abdali, Taj Aldeen Naser, Fog Computing Advancement: Concept, Architecture, Applications, Advantages, and Open Issues, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 75961-75980, (2021); Alhasani, Mohammed Mustafa, A novel four single-sideband M-QAM modulation scheme using a shadow equalizer for mimo system toward 5G communications, Sensors, 19, 8, (2019); Arifuzzaman, Dr Mohammad, Locating the content in the locality: ICN caching and routing strategy revisited, pp. 423-428, (2015); Barroso, Luiz André, The case for energy-proportional computing, Computer, 40, 12, pp. 33-37, (2007); Bashir, Shahid, An optimized algorithm for D2D-MIMO 5G wireless networks, Computers, Materials and Continua, 68, 3, pp. 3029-3044, (2021); Integrated Icn and Cdn Slice as A Service, (2018); Breslau, Lee, Web caching and zipf-like distributions: Evidence and implications, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 1, pp. 126-134, (1999); An Energy Efficiency Assessment of Content Centric Networking Ccn, (2012); Chiaraviglio, Luca, Minimizing ISP network energy cost: Formulation and solutions, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 20, 2, pp. 463-476, (2012); Dai, Jie, Collaborative hierarchical caching with dynamic request routing for massive content distribution, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 2444-2452, (2012)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783031019494; 9783031019487","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198693138"

A high removal efficiency up to >99% was shown in a 5 mg L−1 CBZ solution after 6 h of irradiation with a total energy of 150.92 kJ. The kinetic degradation was not affected in an alkaline solution (at pH 7, pH 10, and pH 13) but was faster under acidic conditions (pH 2) in which CBZ existed in the protonated form. The presence of NO<inf>3</inf>− (10–50 mg L−1) slightly affected the photodegradation of CBZ while humic acid significantly reduced the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the presence of major ions in water also had a negative effect at concentrations between 10 and 50 mg L−1. The MS/MS was used to identify the transformation products of CBZ, and a possible degradation mechanism was proposed. The toxicity of CBZ and the by-products was primarily evaluated.

In Vietnam, around 70,000 households were displaced in 2020, causing uncertainty and social disruption. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of resettlement on the livelihood and food security of displaced households, explore the underlying challenges and causes of these effects, and recommend policy implications for sustainable livelihood development and poverty alleviation. This study conducted a decade-long sociological examination of three displaced communities in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. Our research reveals that resettled households are unable to regain their former standard of living due to the loss of cultivated land and restricted access to public property, which exacerbates food insecurity. Unemployment, illiteracy, and low income further perpetuate poverty. These findings highlight the deficiencies in current policies and planning approaches and call for implementing socially responsible resettlement processes guided by principles of equity. Addressing the inequalities arising from displacement and enabling affected communities to participate in growth is economically justified and morally imperative. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Food Insecurity; Hydropower Dams; Impoverishment; Livelihoods; Poverty","","","","","Special Evaluation Study on the Social and Environmental Impacts of Selected Hydropower Projects, (1999); Research Methods in Anthropology Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches, (2006); Bisht, Tulsi Charan, Development-Induced displacement and women: The case of the Tehri Dam, India, Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology, 10, 4, pp. 301-317, (2009); Bui, Hang Thi Minh, Resettling Farm Households in Northwestern Vietnam: Livelihood Change and Adaptation, International Journal of Water Resources Development, 27, 4, pp. 769-785, (2011); Bui, Hang Thi Minh, Hydropower development in Vietnam: Involuntary resettlement and factors enabling rehabilitation, Land Use Policy, 31, pp. 536-544, (2013); Cernea, Michael M., The risks and reconstruction model for resettling displaced populations, World Development, 25, 10, pp. 1569-1587, (1997); Un Symposium on Hydropower and Sustainable Development, (2004); Paper Presented at the Un Symposium on Hydropower and Sustainable Development in Support of and as Background to the Keynote Paper Presented by the Same Author in the Set of Sessions of the Symposium Devoted to the Social Aspects of Hydropower Development, (2002); Cernea, Michael M., For a new economics of resettlement: A sociological critique of the compensation principle, International Social Science Journal, 55, 175, pp. 37-45, (2003); Water Science and Engineering, (2008)","","MDPI","","","","","","20760760","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153773882"

To date, there is a lack of differentiation in the key nutrients and flavor qualities of NCS products among countries, which makes it difficult for interested parties to select NCSs suitable for their needs. This study aimed to evaluate the minerals and volatile organic components (VOCs) in NCS products from Japan and ASEAN countries. Mineral components were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). VOCs and their aroma profiles were examined using gas chromatography–mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) and MS-e-nose analyses, respectively. The total minerals content in Japanese NCSs ranged from 228.58 to 1347.53 mg/100 g, comprising K, Ca, Mg, P, and Na (69.1, 16.6, 7.9, 4.5, and 3.2%, respectively); their average total amounts were as high as those of Malaysia and Indonesia origins (962.87, 984.67, and 928.47 mg/100 g, respectively). Forty-four VOCs were identified, of which concentrations of pyrazines, furans, and pyranones varied significantly among the NCSs. Additionally, the MS-e-nose analysis provided a multivariate differentiation profile of the NCS products based on differences in the intensities of the VOC ion masses. Nine statistical clusters were presented, wherein certain NCS products of ASEAN origin had volatile profiles comparable to those of the Japanese products. These outcomes suggest that the origin of production greatly influences the mineral and VOC compositions of NCS, affecting their quality traits. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Maillard Reaction Product; Mineral; Ms-e-nose; Non-centrifugal Cane Sugar; Production Origin; Volatile Organic Component","","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K15784 and a research grant from the Faculty of Medicine, Diponegoro University (grant number: 1661/UN7.5.4.2/PP/2021).","Weerawatanakorn, Monthana, Physicochemical, antioxidant, volatile component, and mass spectrometry-based electronic nose analyses differentiated unrefined non-centrifugal cane, palm, and coconut sugars, Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization, 15, 2, pp. 1563-1577, (2021); Filipčev, Bojana, Effect of Liquid (Native) and Dry Molasses Originating from Sugar Beet on Physical and Textural Properties of Gluten-Free Biscuit and Biscuit Dough, Journal of Texture Studies, 46, 5, pp. 353-364, (2015); Zidan, Dina, Non-Centrifugal Sugar (NCS) and Health: A Review on Functional Components and Health Benefits, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2022); Jaffé, Walter R., Health Effects of Non-Centrifugal Sugar (NCS): A Review, Sugar Tech, 14, 2, pp. 87-94, (2012); Velásquez, Fabián, Non-centrifugal cane sugar processing: A review on recent advances and the influence of process variables on qualities attributes of final products, Journal of Food Engineering, 255, pp. 32-40, (2019); Lee, Joungsuk, Comparative study of the physicochemical, nutritional, and antioxidant properties of some commercial refined and non-centrifugal sugars, Food Research International, 109, pp. 614-625, (2018); Flórez-Martínez, Diego Hernando, Key Drivers for Non-Centrifugal Sugar Cane Research, Technological Development, and Market Linkage: A Technological Roadmap Approach for Colombia, Sugar Tech, 25, 2, pp. 373-385, (2023); Asikin, Yonathan, Compositional and Electronic Discrimination Analyses of Taste and Aroma Profiles of Non-Centrifugal Cane Brown Sugars, Food Analytical Methods, 10, 6, pp. 1844-1856, (2017); Hönig, Vladimír, Nutrient effect on the taste of mineral waters: Evidence from Europe, Foods, 9, 12, (2020); Diego Quintaes, Késia, The importance of minerals in the human diet, pp. 1-21, (2015)","","MDPI","","","","","","23048158","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152786910"

Materials: One hundred and four human skeletons under the age of 20 years old were assessed. Methods: Lesions were recorded macroscopically and radiographically. Differential diagnosis using prior established paleopathological diagnostic criteria for scurvy was conducted. Results: There was no clear evidence for scurvy at Con Co Ngua and a high burden of scurvy was present at Man Bac (>79% diagnosed with probable scurvy). Scurvy levels were high across all non-adult ages at Man Bac indicating significant burden throughout childhood and adolescence. Conclusions: No scurvy at Con Co Ngua is consistent with widely available food sources at the peak of the Holocene thermal maximum. High levels of scurvy at Man Bac corresponds with decreased dietary diversity, high pathogen load, and increased population stress with the transition to agriculture around the time of the 4.2 ka desertification event. Significance: This is the first systematic population-level non-adult investigation of specific nutritional disease in MSEA and demonstrates an increase in nutritional stress during the Neolithic transition in northern Vietnam.

The primary objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting Vietnamese consumer intention to purchase safely certified vegetables (safe vegetables) based on an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 361 urban consumers in Hanoi city based on a stratified sampling technique, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the model. Findings: The results revealed that the extended TPB succeeded to predict 62% of the variance of intention to purchase safe vegetables. Attitude played the most important role in consumer intention. Notably, the attitude of consumers was the most largely influenced by subjective norms (social effects). Also, subjective norms had a direct effect on intention. Furthermore, consumer trust motivated a favorable attitude to increase purchase intention. The effects of past behavior on intention were verified as direct and indirect through subjective norm and trust combined with attitude. Few socio-demographic variables (e.g. age and education) were found to affect intention indirectly through attitude and subjective norm. Research limitations/implications: Further research on the relationship between intention and the actual purchase of safe food is needed. Originality/value: This extends the application of the TPB to predict consumer intention to purchase safely certified food in a developing country like Vietnam by examining both direct and indirect effects of socio-demographic variables, trust and past behavior on intention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Behavior; Food Safety; Intention; Safe Vegetables; Tpb; Vietnam","","","","This work was funded by QR Program, Kyushu University, Japan.

However, the DAB3 topology has limited soft-switching range, particularly under light load conditions when the voltage conversion ratio differs significantly from unity, resulting in hard switching, increased loss, and higher electromagnetic interference. To address these issues, various techniques have been proposed, but they often lead to other problems such as higher current ripple or unbalanced thermal distribution. In this paper, a new modulation scheme, called symmetric duty-cycle control (SDM), is proposed for DAB3 converters to overcome these issues. A multiaspect comparison of SDM was conducted against two existing techniques, SPS and ADCC, and its superiority was validated through simulation and experimental results. Our proposed SDM scheme provides a current ripple within 10% to 15% of the average current and enables zero current switching for the whole voltage and power ranges. Additionally, a modified version of SDM can even improve overall efficiency by 7% compared to the conventional SPS technique. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric Duty-cycle Control; Dual Active Bridge; Single-phase-shift; Symmetric Duty-cycle Control; Electric Vehicle; Electromagnetic Method; Equipment Component; Experimental Study; Model Validation; Topology","electric vehicle; electromagnetic method; equipment component; experimental study; model validation; topology","","","This study was funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2021-SAHEP-005.","Kempton, Willett M., Vehicle-to-grid power implementation: From stabilizing the grid to supporting large-scale renewable energy, Journal of Power Sources, 144, 1, pp. 280-294, (2005); Ota, Yutaka, Autonomous distributed V2G (vehicle-to-grid) satisfying scheduled charging, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 1, pp. 559-564, (2012); Chandra Mouli, Gautham Ram, Implementation of dynamic charging and V2G using Chademo and CCS/Combo DC charging standard, (2016); Chandra-Mouli, Gautham Ram, A 10 kW Solar-Powered Bidirectional EV Charger Compatible with Chademo and COMBO, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 34, 2, pp. 1082-1098, (2019); Inoue, Shigenori, A bidirectional DC-DC converter for an energy storage system with galvanic isolation, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 22, 6, pp. 2299-2306, (2007); Ting, Pang, A three phase ZVS bidirectional DC-DC converter, (2008); De Doncker, Rik W.A.A., A Three-Phase Soft-Switched High-Power-Density DC/DC Converter for High-Power Applications, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 27, 1, pp. 63-73, (1991); Zhao, Biao, Overview of dual-active-bridge isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter for high-frequency-link power-conversion system, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 29, 8, pp. 4091-4106, (2014); He, Peiwen, Comprehensive Analyses and Comparison of 1 kW Isolated DC-DC Converters for Bidirectional EV Charging Systems, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 3, 1, pp. 147-156, (2017); Haghbin, Saeid, The Design and Construction of Transformers for a 50 kW Three-Phase Dual Active Bridge DC/DC Converter, 2018-January, pp. 1-5, (2017)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186213194"

We examined the associations between parental absence (i.e., a major component of ACEs) and both underweight and excess weight among middle-aged rural community dwellers in Vietnam, where experiences of parental absence was not uncommon during and after the Vietnam War (1955–1975). Methods: Data came from 3000 middle-aged adults who participated in the baseline survey of Khánh Hòa Cardiovascular Study. Parental absence was defined as parental absence due to death, divorce, or out-migration. Using information on the timing of such events, we categorized participants into those who experienced parental absence before the age of 3, between the ages of 3 and 15, and those without such experiences. BMI was calculated based on measured height and weight (kg/m2) and categorized into three groups: underweight <18.5; normal 18.5–24.9; excess weight ≥ 25. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to investigate the association between parental absence and adult weight status. Results: Parental absence that occurred before the age of 3 was marginally significantly associated with underweight (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95, 2.20) but not with overweight/obesity. Parental divorce was associated with overweight/obesity (RRR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.28, 4.81), but not parental absence due to migratory work. Conclusions: While previous studies in Western settings focused almost exclusively on the risk of obesity in relation to exposure to ACEs, our findings point to the potential importance of considering the risk of underweight in low- and middle-income countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Adult; Body Weight Gain; Child; Human; Middle Aged; Obesity; Preschool Child; Risk Factor; Rural Population; Underweight; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Thinness; Vietnam; Weight Gain","adolescent; adult; body weight gain; child; human; middle aged; obesity; preschool child; risk factor; rural population; underweight; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Thinness; Vietnam; Weight Gain","","","Funding text 1: National Center for Global Health and Medicine; Pfizer Health Research Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; JSPS Funding information; Funding text 2: This study was financially supported by the Grant of National Center for Global Health and Medicine (Y.I., grant number 19A06); Pfizer Health Research Foundation (Y.I., no grant number); and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (Y.I., grant number 19 K20536), (A.Y., grant number 21 J01171), (D.V.H., grant number 21 K17301).

The approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in climate change vulnerability assessment was examined considering three main components of vulnerability which are exposure to hazards, local sensitivity and adaptive capacity. A GIS-based approach was applied to generate a set of indicators and the fuzzy AHP method was investigated for the determination of a weighted scheme for parameters included in the climate vulnerability assessment. The study results indicated that the coastal and lowland districts including Ngu Hanh Son, Hoa Vang, Cam Le and Thanh Khe districts are most vulnerable to climate change due to high exposure, high sensitivity and limited adaptive capacity. On the contrary, the district with high level of adaptive capacity such as Hai Chau district is usually ranged in low level of vulnerability. The results confirm the importance of enhanced adaptive capacity in responding to the impact of climate change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Da Nang City; Gis; Multi-criteria; Vulnerability; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Gis; Multicriteria Analysis; Risk Assessment; Vulnerability; Da Nang; Viet Nam","analytical hierarchy process; climate change; climate effect; GIS; multicriteria analysis; risk assessment; vulnerability; Da Nang; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported by the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) under the project number B2021-DNA-14.

However, in recent years, urbanisation changed the income structure of residents near mangroves. Different landscapes provide different job opportunities; thus, analysis of regional landscape patterns is important for understanding income structures. In this study, surveys on the income structure and landscape patterns of the surrounding areas of three mangrove sites were conducted in the Hau and Hoang Mai River estuaries in Nghe An Province, North-Central Vietnam. The results reveal that both natural and socio-economic landscape components affected income structure. The major occupations in the study area were agriculture, including husbandry, sea fishing, and trading. Land morphology and river type were the major factors influencing the income from agriculture, while coastline morphology primarily affected income from sea fishing. Community-based trading was carried out in the study area; thus, the population inside each administrative unit was a significant factor increasing income, while the retail market size in an area had significant negative effects, potentially due to the increasing number of competitors. Our study aimed to evaluate mangrove ecosystem importance for local livelihoods in relation to landscape patterns, and the results contribute to urban planning based on the conservation and sustainable use of mangrove ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystem Service; Income Structure; Landscape; Livelihood; Mangrove; Ecosystem Service; Landscape Ecology; Livelihood; Mangrove; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Urban Planning; Urbanization; Viet Nam","ecosystem service; landscape ecology; livelihood; mangrove; spatiotemporal analysis; urban planning; urbanization; Viet Nam","","","This research was supported by a scientific project of the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training, code B2022-TDV-08.

While many previous conventional attempts to measure resilience at the household level have largely employed the “objective” top-down framework relying mostly on a macro observed socioeconomic dataset, this present work seeks to estimate household resilience through an alternative bottom-up method, called the “subjective” resilience approach. With specific reference to the context of two ethnic Pa Cô and Tà Ôi minorities living in upland areas of Central Vietnam, this study aims to (1) measure household resilience to climate change by scoring five livelihood capitals, financial, human, social, physical, and natural, by applying the Household Livelihood Resilience (HLR) framework; and (2) provide an intersectional lens of ethnicity and gender in relation to the household’s livelihood resilience. To achieve these goals, in addition to two focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews, an empirical survey of 236 households was conducted between September to December 2021. Our findings indicated that there are differences in observed livelihood resilience among the ethnic minority groups and, within that, between gender (sex, status) factors. Ethnic women and poor households have a lower resilience than other groups in society due to their lower human capital and limited access to public and financial resources, which are to some degree linked to the difference in the gender division of labor and the cultural norms of patriarch traditions. This study highlights the importance of considering gender and poverty in resilience-building efforts and offers insights for future programs in multi-ethnic developing countries such as Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Gender; Livelihood Resilience; Poverty Alleviation; Vietnam; Climate Change; Ethnicity; Gender; Household Energy; Labor Division; Livelihood; Poverty Alleviation; Viet Nam","climate change; ethnicity; gender; household energy; labor division; livelihood; poverty alleviation; Viet Nam","","","This work was financially supported by Hue University under the Core Research Program, Grant No. NCM.DHH.2019.06.","Provisional State of the Global Climate Report 2022; Climate Change 2022 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2022); Dinh, Nguyen Cong, Long-Term Improvement in Precautions for Flood Risk Mitigation: A Case Study in the Low-Lying Area of Central Vietnam, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 12, 2, pp. 250-266, (2021); Nguyen Duc, Kien, Farmers' choices of climate-resilient strategies: Evidence from Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 317, (2021); Nguyen, Yen Thi Bich, Determinants of livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Two minority ethnic communities in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam, Environmental Science and Policy, 123, pp. 11-20, (2021); Phuong, Tran Thi, Livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Indexes and insights from two ethnic minority communities in Central Vietnam, Environmental Challenges, 10, (2023); Sam, Anu Susan, Vulnerabilities to flood hazards among rural households in India, Natural Hazards, 88, 2, pp. 1133-1153, (2017); Zeleke, Getnet, Farmers' livelihood vulnerability to climate-related risks in the North Wello Zone, northern Ethiopia, Environmental and Sustainability Indicators, 17, (2023); Tran, Van Thanh, Nuanced assessment of livelihood resilience through the intersectional lens of gender and ethnicity: Evidence from small-scale farming communities in the upland regions of Vietnam, Journal of Rural Studies, 92, pp. 68-78, (2022); Tanner, Thomas M., Livelihood resilience in the face of climate change, Nature Climate Change, 5, 1, pp. 23-26, (2015)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149276592"

Therefore, we herein investigated the relationships among depression, body mass index (BMI), and CP in community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly individuals. Participants comprised 2216 inhabitants of Shika town in Ishikawa prefecture, Japan, including 1003 males (mean age of 68.72 years, standard deviation (SD) of 8.36) and 1213 females (mean age of 69.65 years, SD of 9.36). CP and DS were assessed using a CP questionnaire and Geriatric Depression Scale-15, respectively. The Breslow–Day test indicated that DS positively correlated with lumbar/knee pain in the BMI < 25 group, but not in the BMI ≥ 25 group. Furthermore, lumber/knee pain was related to a higher BMI. These results were confirmed by a logistic analysis with age, sex, BMI, solitary living, the duration of education, no exercise/hobbies, smoking history, alcohol intake, and medical treatment for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension as confounding factors. The present study indicates the importance of considering DS and BMI in the prevention of CP.

In response, government authorities plan to implement a wide range of AI-driven healthcare solutions. These include care robots that assist the physically handicapped or elderly, chatbots that provide anonymous online mental health consultation, and diagnostic software utilizing machine learning. Yet one of the most popular smart technologies to augment the nation's already overstrained and undermanned healthcare system is a little known but emerging emotional AI technologies, i.e., deep learning systems trained to read, classify, and respond to human emotions. These technologies are being sold on a commercial level not only to the public but also to rehabilitation centers, local hospitals, and senior citizen residences. Although the augmentation of healthcare services to intelligent machines may seem like a logical step in a country well-known for its long-standing affection toward robots, Japanese society is also known for its adherence to established social relations and traditional institutional practices, especially, in the realm of medical care. In order to gauge Japanese acceptance of emotion-sensing technology, we analyze a dataset of 245 visitors to clinics and hospitals in a typical suburban area in Japan using multiple linear regression. The results show that in general, senior and male patients perceive the emotional AI technology more negatively. For behavioral variables, patients' level of familiarity has positive correlations with attitudes toward emotional AI-based applications in private setting (β<inf>Familiarity_AttitudePri</inf>=0.346, p<0.001) and public setting (β<inf>Familiarity_PublicAttitude</inf>=0.297, p<0.001); while concern for losing control to AI has negative correlations with the attitudes' variables: private setting (β<inf>LosingControl_AttitudePri</inf>=−0.262,p=0.002) and public setting (β <inf>LosingControl_AttitudePub</inf>=-0.188, p=0.044). Interestingly, concerns over violation of privacy and discrimination are non-significant correlates, which contradict the emerging literature on this subject. We further contextualize the findings with insights afforded by an understanding of Japanese culture as well as the relevant literature on care robots in Japan. Finally, policy and education implications to promote emotional AI acceptance to the general and senior members of the society are provided. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai In Healthcare; Artificial Intelligence (ai); Emotional Ai (eai); Japan; Japanese Elderly Patients; Behavioral Research; Deep Learning; Engineering Education; Health Care; Hospitals; Learning Systems; Linear Regression; Aging Population; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare; Artificial Intelligence Technologies; Cross-sectional Surveys; Emotional Artificial Intelligence; Healthcare Systems; Healthcare Workers; Japan; Japanese Elderly Patient; Diagnosis; Aging Population; Artificial Intelligence; Elderly Care; Health Care; Machine Learning; Mental Health; Software","Behavioral research; Deep learning; Engineering education; Health care; Hospitals; Learning systems; Linear regression; Aging population; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence in healthcare; Artificial intelligence technologies; Cross-sectional surveys; Emotional artificial intelligence; Healthcare systems; Healthcare workers; Japan; Japanese elderly patient; Diagnosis; aging population; artificial intelligence; elderly care; health care; machine learning; mental health; software","","","Funding text 1: This study is part of the project “Emotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life” funded by JST -UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6 .

Until recently, these devices consisted mainly of GPS tools that track location, software that scrutinizes browser activity and keyboard strokes, and heat/motion sensors that monitor workstation presence. Today, however, a new generation of biometric devices has emerged that can sense, read, monitor and evaluate the affective state of a worker. More popularly known by its commercial moniker, Emotional AI, the technology stems from advancements in affective computing. But whereas previous generations of biometric monitoring targeted the exterior physical body of the worker, concurrent with the writings of Foucault and Hardt, we argue that emotion-recognition tools signal a far more invasive disciplinary gaze that exposes and makes vulnerable the inner regions of the worker-self. Our paper explores attitudes towards empathic surveillance by analyzing a survey of 1015 responses of future job-seekers from 48 countries with Bayesian statistics. Our findings reveal affect tools, left unregulated in the workplace, may lead to heightened stress and anxiety among disadvantaged ethnicities, gender and income class. We also discuss a stark cross-cultural discrepancy whereby East Asians, compared to Western subjects, are more likely to profess a trusting attitude toward EAI-enabled automated management. While this emerging technology is driven by neoliberal incentives to optimize the worksite and increase productivity, ultimately, empathic surveillance may create more problems in terms of algorithmic bias, opaque decisionism, and the erosion of employment relations. Thus, this paper nuances and extends emerging literature on emotion-sensing technologies in the workplace, particularly through its highly original cross-cultural study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Management; Bayesian Analysis; Cross-cultural Perception; Emotional Ai; Biometrics; Emotion Recognition; Human Resource Management; Automated Management; Bayesian Analysis; Biometric Device; Biometrics Technology; Cross-cultural Perceptions; Cultural Determinants; Emotional Ai; Motion Sensors; Sociodemographics; Workers'; Behavioral Research","Biometrics; Emotion Recognition; Human resource management; Automated management; Bayesian Analysis; Biometric device; Biometrics technology; Cross-cultural perceptions; Cultural determinants; Emotional AI; Motion sensors; Sociodemographics; Workers'; Behavioral research","","","Funding text 1: This study is part of the project “Emotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life” funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019).

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of the participation on farmer’s income as well as the major factors that affect the participation in cooperatives by the vegetable farmers in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: The study used primary data collected from vegetable farmers in Vietnam. This study utilized propensity score matching to avoid initial selection bias. The differences between participants and nonparticipants will be adjusted by matching each membership individual to a nonmember based on similar observable characteristics by summarizing the conditional probability of a member given pretreatment characteristics. Findings: This study demonstrates that participation in cooperatives is significantly affected by ethnicity, age of household head, labor involving vegetable production and extension service access. The results of this study also confirm that agricultural cooperatives have positive effects on member farmers to enhance income and that participants – on average – have a higher income than nonparticipants. Research limitations/implications: The method cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias due to unobserved differences between participants and even an appropriate comparison group. Originality/value: This study contributes to an improved understanding about impacts of cooperatives on farmers’ income in developing and emerging economies. Moreover, research also upgrades knowledge regarding the effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives in Vietnam, as well as guides policymakers in supporting the cooperatives in expanding the market and other necessary changes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Cooperatives; Income; Propensity Score Matching","","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H00960.

The other objective was to provide recommendations for policymakers and manufacturers to promote and customize cargo EVs to meet the requirements of carriers in the LMD sector. Design/methodology/approach: In this study the authors constructed a research framework that adjusted and extended the original technology acceptance model (TAM). The proposed model combines eight psychological factors, including attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement, face consciousness, financial incentive policy and carrier intention, in which four factors, namely attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention, were obtained from the original TAM and the four remaining factors, namely perceived risk, public engagement, face consciousness and financial incentive policy, were added. Findings: The results showed that psychological factors such as attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement and face consciousness might affect carriers' intentions to use electric cargo vehicles in LMD service in Vietnamese cities. These results agree with the previous studies and confirm that attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement and face consciousness might be important for shaping intention to use electric cargo vehicles in emerging markets. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations, first, the data were collected in Vietnam, a country with weak academic contributions. Therefore, these findings might not be generalizable to other areas. The authors expect to apply the same research framework to other countries to explore the similarities and differences across the countries. Second, the authors conducted the surveys in three cities; except for Hanoi, the other two cities are not really large markets in the LMD service sector. Third, the authors ignored the relationship between the demographic characteristics and electric cargo vehicles. Further studies should address this gap. Practical implications: Based on the findings, manufacturers should ensure the high-quality performance of electric cargo vehicles in terms of extending driving range and shortening recharging time. Policymakers should develop the roadmaps for electric cargo vehicles, starting from switching from conventional cargo motorcycles to electric motorcycles. In addition, developing public charging infrastructure should be prioritized, which is the fundamental basis for operating electric cargo vehicles. Finally, manufacturers should research and develop a product that would improve the reputation of carriers because carriers with higher face consciousness are more likely to pursue brand-name and high-priced products in order to enhance their reputation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in two aspects: First, the authors investigated intentions to use electric cargo vehicles in LMD service, which is rare from other studies, and they further identified the psychological determinants of carriers' intentions. Second, the findings increase the knowledge of carriers' intentions and suggest implications for policymakers and manufacturers to promote the adoption of electric cargo vehicles in last-mile deliver service. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carriers' Intentions; Electric Cargo Vehicles; Last-mile Delivery; Psychological Factors","","","","","Acheampong, Ransford A., Capturing the behavioural determinants behind the adoption of autonomous vehicles: Conceptual frameworks and measurement models to predict public transport, sharing and ownership trends of self-driving cars, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 62, pp. 349-375, (2019); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Allen, Julian, Understanding the impact of e-commerce on last-mile light goods vehicle activity in urban areas: The case of London, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 61, pp. 325-338, (2018); Anosike, Anthony Ikechukwu, Exploring the challenges of electric vehicle adoption in final mile parcel delivery, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 26, 6, pp. 683-707, (2023); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1991); Bao, Yeqing, Face Consciousness and Risk Aversion: Do They Affect Consumer Decision-Making?, Psychology and Marketing, 20, 8, pp. 733-755, (2003); Bearth, Angela, Are risk or benefit perceptions more important for public acceptance of innovative food technologies: A meta-analysis, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 49, pp. 14-23, (2016); Buckley, Lisa D., Psychosocial factors associated with intended use of automated vehicles: A simulated driving study, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 115, pp. 202-208, (2018); Carley, Sanya R., Intent to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle: A survey of early impressions in large US cites, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 18, 1, pp. 39-45, (2013); Cegarra-Navarro, Juan Gabriel, Technology knowledge and governance: Empowering citizen engagement and participation, Government Information Quarterly, 31, 4, pp. 660-668, (2014)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17586550; 09574093","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133956160"

This study examined the understanding of Quality Physical Education (QPE) from the perspective of PE professionals primarily entrusted with implementing initiatives to develop QPE. A total of 2,191 individuals from 25 Asian cities participated in this study. They completed a validated QPE questionnaire consisting of 49 items distributed into eight dimensions. The variables of gender, work position, and years of experience were investigated in accounting for the differences in perceptions. The overall mean value for QPE was 7.32, with excellent internal consistency (a= .986). The results indicated similar trends in the perceptions of the QPE and evaluation of the items by professionals. No significant differences between genders and across work positions were found. However, significant differences were found among perceptions depending on the years of experience in teaching PE. Moreover, findings revealed the need for governmental support for research in PE and collaborative work at the international and national levels.

The research used IMU sensors to collect the joints' angles values when exercising under instruction of doctors. The data were evaluated based on the FUGL-MEYER assessment scale. By collecting the boundary values of the lower limb joint angles (hip, knee, ankle), and then scoring these boundary values based on the criteria in the FUGL-MEYER scale, doctors can evaluate the recovery of lower limb function in patients. In fact, during experiments IMU sensors were easily affected by environmental noise. Thus in order to ensure the accurate operation of the sensors, Kalman filter is applied to predicts changes in deviation and makes real-Time adjustments to minimize the errors. After researching and developing the device, the system was installed on healthy individuals in the first trial. The results showed that the joint angle values obtained from the IMU were quite accurate compared to the actual joint angles of the lower limbs. Therefore, in the next phase, the device is expected to achieve similar accuracy when tested on stroke patients.

They produce multi-view sensor data that may consist of video streams by surveillance cameras, accelerometers, strain meters, etc. Each sensor gives us some view of objective events on the bridge. Suppose we observe vehicles passing over the bridge. Surveillance cameras give us the information about the speed of the vehicles in addition to the identity of the vehicles. On the other hand, multiple strain meters give us the information about the speed of the vehicles as well as their weight. Thus, the different kind of sensors enable us to obtain the same information like vehicle speed from the different views, which enables us to improve the accuracy of the speed estimation. They also provide complementary information like weight and identity of the vehicle. For utilizing the multi-view sensor data, we need to align the events observed in each sensor data. This paper proposes a neural-based event alignment system, which consists of two components. The first component performs event detection from each sensor data and event alignment among the sensor data are carried out in the second component. The event detection methods are different depending on the type of sensors as well as the events. This paper handles the event of vehicle passage and using signal data collected from accelerometers and strain meters. We apply an event detection method from sensor data that consists of (i) feature extraction by Wavelet transform and (ii) peak detection by a neural error construction model. Once the events are extracted from the sensor data, we align them based on simple yet effective procedure. The accuracy of proposed system are evaluated using bridge health monitoring data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accelerometers; Alignment; Cameras; Data Mining; Feature Extraction; Security Systems; Wavelet Transforms; Bridge Monitoring; Data Alignments; Detection Methods; Event Alignment; Events Detection; Multi-views; Sensor Technologies; Sensors Data; Strain-meter; Surveillance Cameras; Vehicles","Accelerometers; Alignment; Cameras; Data mining; Feature extraction; Security systems; Wavelet transforms; Bridge monitoring; Data alignments; Detection methods; Event alignment; Events detection; Multi-views; Sensor technologies; Sensors data; Strain-meter; Surveillance cameras; Vehicles","","","","Alegre-Sanahuja, Juan, Wavelet transform based vehicle detection from sensors for bridge weigh-in-motion, Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, 04-08-April-2016, pp. 935-940, (2016); Variational Autoencoder Based Anomaly Detection Using Reconstruction Probability, (2015); Wavelets and Statistics, (1995); Catbas, F.

The former is about relevancy where as the latter is about affirmation (or conclusion). While relevancy and affirmation are two different concepts, there is obviously a connection between them. That is why performing retrieval and textual entailment sequentially and independently may not make the most of this mutually supportive relationship. This paper, therefore, propose a multi-task learning model for these two tasks to improve their performance. Technically, in the COLIEE dataset, we use the information of Task 4 (conclusions) to improve the performance of Task 3 (searching for legal provisions related to the question). Our empirical findings indicate that this supportive relationship truly exists.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how effluent recirculation affects the two-stage anaerobic digestion of biodegradable municipal solid waste. METHODS: Firstly, biodegradable municipal solid waste substrate was fermented under conditions of 12 percent initial total solids and a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius for 5 days. After that, the substrate continued to be diluted using tap water or the effluent stream with a rate of 2:1. In the case of using the effluent stream, the experiment was further performed with dilution rates of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:2. Then, the liquid part was collected and pumped into the methane reactor at an organic loading rate of 7.64 grams of total solids per liter per day at 36 degrees Celsius. The methane reactor was an up-flow reactor that contained both granular sludge and suspended sludge. The effectiveness of the experimental stages was evaluated through biogas production and chemical oxygen demand removal. FINDINGS: In the fermentative reactor, using the effluent stream to dilute solid-state feedstock helped keep the reactor stable at pH 5.5 without alkali addition. In the case of using tap water for dilution, it required a dose of 115.8 grams and 75.3 grams of sodium hydroxide per kilogram of volatile solids to attain pH conditions at 6.5 and 5.5, respectively. Maintaining the reactor at pH 6.5 increased the concentration of fermentation products compared to pH 5.5, including 5.9 percent total chemical oxygen demand, 5.5 percent soluble chemical oxygen demand, and 10.6 percent total volatile fatty acids. In the case of recirculating the effluent stream in the methane reactor, increasing the dilution rate from 0.5 to 3.0 resulted in a methane yield of 227.5-278.9 milliliter per gram of volatile solids and 85-93 percent chemical oxygen demand removal. The methane reactor’s best digestion performance was attained at recirculation rate 2. Methane formation mainly occurred in granular sludge via the hydrogenotrophic pathway. Methane formation in suspended sludge occurred in a secondary manner, mainly via both the hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic pathways. Among methanogen families, Methanobacteriaceae was found to have the highest relative abundance (7.5 percent in granular sludge and 0.8 percent in suspended sludge). CONCLUSION: Recirculating the effluent provided significant benefits, including the ability to stabilize the hydrolysis process and increase the methane yield. A recirculation rate of 2 to obtain a total chemical oxygen demand of 35.2 grams per liter was the best condition for methanogenesis. Acetotrophic methanogens were better adapted to difficult conditions than hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The formation of methane mainly occurred in granular sludge via a dominant hydrogenotrophic pathway. Methane formation in suspended sludge occurred in a secondary manner, mainly via both the hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic pathways. Among methanogen families, Methanobacteriaceae was found to have the highest relative abundance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradable Solid Waste; Fermentation; Recirculation; Two-stage Anaerobic Digestion; Anaerobic Digestion; Biodegradation; Effluent; Fermentation; Municipal Solid Waste; Waste Treatment","anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; effluent; fermentation; municipal solid waste; waste treatment","","","This study is funded by the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training under [Grant number B2021-XDA-03].

This paper introduces the Style-Enhanced Normalization TTS (STEN-TTS) approach to synthesizing multilingual voice and maintaining personal styles with only 3 seconds of input reference. By presenting an integrated module (STEN) into the diffusion model, the proposed method can simulate the speaker's style and eliminate white noise in the synthesized speech. The experimental results show that our model achieves good performance, at above 3.5 on SMOS for cross-lingual switching. Furthermore, when using speaker verification to assess the similarity between the ground truth and synthesized voices, the accuracy reaches 82.4% with 3 seconds of audio reference. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Diffusion Model; Multilingual Text-to-speech; Shot Noise; Speech Communication; Speech Recognition; White Noise; Adaptation; Cross-lingual; Diffusion Model; Fine Tuning; Learning Aid; Multilingual Text-to-speech; Multilingual Texts; Normalisation; Text To Speech; Virtual Assistants; Diffusion","Shot noise; Speech communication; Speech recognition; White noise; Adaptation; Cross-lingual; Diffusion model; Fine tuning; Learning aid; Multilingual text-to-speech; Multilingual texts; Normalisation; Text to speech; Virtual assistants; Diffusion","","","Part of this work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP21H05054 and JP21H03467.","Chen, Yutian, Sample efficient adaptive text-to-speech, (2019); Chou, Yuying, ADAPTIVE AND GENERATIVE ZERO-SHOT LEARNING, (2021); Min, Dongchan, Meta-StyleSpeech: Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 139, pp. 7748-7759, (2021); Chen, Mingjian, MultiSpeech: Multi-speaker text to speech with transformer, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2020-October, pp. 4024-4028, (2020); Jia, Ye, Transfer learning from speaker verification to multispeaker text-to-speech synthesis, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2018-December, pp. 4480-4490, (2018); Wu, Yihan, AdaSpeech 4: Adaptive Text to Speech in Zero-Shot Scenarios, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2022-September, pp. 2568-2572, (2022); Shen, Jonathan, Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning Wavenet on MEL Spectrogram Predictions, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2018-April, pp. 4779-4783, (2018); Nekvinda, Tomáš, One model, many languages: Meta-learning for multilingual text-to-speech, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2020-October, pp. 2972-2976, (2020); Zhang, Yu, Learning to speak fluently in a foreign language: Multilingual speech synthesis and cross-language voice cloning, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2019-September, pp. 2080-2084, (2019); Ren, Yi, FASTSPEECH 2: FAST AND HIGH-QUALITY END-TO-END TEXT TO SPEECH, (2021)","","International Speech Communication Association","Amazon Science; Apple; Dataocean AI; et al.; Google Research; Meta AI","24rd Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH 2023","","Dublin; Convention Centre Dublin","191724","29581796; 2308457X","9781713836902; 9781713820697; 9781605603162; 9781617821233; 9781604234497","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171522462"

We explored the underlying socio-cultural environment of marginalized communities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to ascertain why these groups participate in a malaria elimination project, through 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork, including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, informal conversations, and observation. Findings show various reasonings and motivations of these communities to use participation. In Vietnam, the Stieng and M’nong ethnic minority groups used participation to protest ethnic inequalities and abuses. In Laos, the Brao ethnic minority group feigned participation to deter outside interference in their traditional spaces and identity. In Cambodia, marginalized Khmer and Cham communities actively participated in the project to tailor community development. The paper concludes that participation in health interventions was consistently manipulated as a strategy to protect or nurture community identity and further socio-cultural and political interests. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Community Participation; Development; Ethnic Minority; Hegemony; Malaria Elimination; Marginalized Community; Community Development; Disease Control; Ethnic Minority; Ethnography; Hegemony; Local Participation; Malaria; Participatory Approach; Cambodia; Laos; Viet Nam","community development; disease control; ethnic minority; ethnography; hegemony; local participation; malaria; participatory approach; Cambodia; Laos; Viet Nam","","","This study was contracted by PSI, funded under Gates Foundation Project, by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Besides pushing targeted and personalized content perceived by users as more persuasive, algorithmic innovations in “affect recognition” have given artificially intelligent agents the ability to exploit the emotional state of social media users. On encrypted social media channels, such social media bots are especially useful to extremist groups which lack human and financial resources to enact large-scale psychological warfare campaigns. As newer generations of social bots grow their ability to read and respond to human emotions and, in turn, increase their anthropomorphic tendencies, we argue that these automated headhunters will play a dominant role in online radicalization. This chapter undertakes a qualitative study of the affective role of conversational AI in establishing an emotional relationship with potential recruits in online radicalization. We also assess current efforts by Western security agencies, social media companies, and academic researchers to counter online radicalization strategies by extremist organizations. Our chapter points to the need of greater cross-platform multi-disciplinary research, study of bots that operate in foreign languages, and detection of extremist content in multimodal forms such as memes, music, videos, and selfies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affective Bonding; Ai; Artificial Intelligence; Extremism; Online Radicalization; Radicalization; Social Bots","","","","","Morning Consult, (2021); Agnihotri, Manish, Towards generating topic-driven and affective responses to assist mental wellness, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12662 LNCS, pp. 129-143, (2021); Pro China Misinformation Group Continues Spreading Messages Researchers Say, (2020); Hateful People or Hateful Bots Detection and Characterization of Bots Spreading Religious Hatred in Arabic Social Media, (2019); undefined; Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats, (2021); Araque, Oscar, An approach for radicalization detection based on emotion signals and semantic similarity, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 17877-17891, (2020); Cloud Caliphate Archiving the Islamic State in Real Time Institute for Strategic Dialogue Ist, (2021); Affective Politics of Digital Media Propaganda by Other Means, (2021); Edge of Violence A Radical Approach to Extremism, (2010)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783031225529; 9783031225512","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165393799"

The effects of droughts on crop production, household expenditure, rural poverty and internal migration in Vietnam were investigated using a unique panel dataset while controlling for potential issues that could lead to biased estimations. We find comprehensive evidence that droughts not only caused a significant decline in rice productivity and rural household consumption, but also pushed them into poverty. Furthermore, droughts are strongly linked to rural people's decisions to migrate to other areas, pushing migration decisions through the productivity, consumption and poverty channels. Understanding the complex relationship between climate change, particularly drought, and its consequences is critical for developing policy interventions to help rural populations cope with climate change risks and uncertainties.

However, there are gaps in mapping seagrass in tropical coastal waters due to turbidity and constantly changing tidal dynamics. To tackle such issues, tidal heights and reflectance of 33 Sentinel-2 images were used to calculate a multitemporal composite of Sentinel-2 images, which was classified using the Random Forest classifier. UAV images classified with Object-based image analysis provided ground truth for training and validation. The effectiveness of water column correction and using the multitemporal composite was evaluated by comparing overall classification accuracy. As a result, applying water column correction improved classification accuracy from 80.4% to 80.6%, while using the multi-temporal composite improved accuracy to 88.6%, among the highest accuracy achieved for seagrass classification in turbid waters. The combined protocol could lead to advances in quantifying seagrass distribution in the tropical coastal waters and their carbon sequestration capacity, resolving significant uncertainties in blue carbon estimation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blue Carbon Ecosystems; Object-based Image Analysis; Seagrass Mapping; Tidal Dynamics; Time Series Analysis; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Coastal Water; Image Analysis; Mapping; Seagrass Meadow; Sentinel; Time Series Analysis; Unmanned Vehicle; Viet Nam","coastal water; image analysis; mapping; seagrass meadow; Sentinel; time series analysis; unmanned vehicle; Viet Nam","","","","undefined, (2017); Baumstark, René D., Mapping seagrass and colonized hard bottom in Springs Coast, Florida using WorldView-2 satellite imagery, Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 181, pp. 83-92, (2016); Borfecchia, Flavio, Mapping Spatial Patterns of Posidonia oceanica Meadows by Means of Daedalus ATM Airborne Sensor in the Coastal Area of Civitavecchia (Central Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy), Remote Sensing, 5, 10, pp. 4877-4899, (2013); Luong, Cao Van, Status and threats on seagrass beds using GIS in Vietnam, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8525, (2012); Remote Sens, (2022); Costanza, Robert, The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, Nature, 387, 6630, pp. 253-260, (1997); Costanza, Robert, Changes in the global value of ecosystem services, Global Environmental Change, 26, 1, pp. 152-158, (2014); Cullen-Unsworth, Leanne C., Seagrass meadows, ecosystem services, and sustainability, Environment, 55, 3, pp. 14-28, (2013); De Groot, Rudolf S., Global estimates of the value of ecosystems and their services in monetary units, Ecosystem Services, 1, 1, pp. 50-61, (2012); Dewsbury, Bryan M., A review of seagrass economic valuations: Gaps and progress in valuation approaches, Ecosystem Services, 18, pp. 68-77, (2016)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","10106049","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150520808"

However, the hypothesis that expanding rail transport networks and implementing TOD policies will improve urban accessibility in developing cities has not been sufficiently analyzed. Therefore, this study selected four Asian cities of various sizes under different stages of development to explore how the expansion of rail transport networks and implementation in high-density development of the three TOD policies affect urban accessibility. The results suggest that rail transit network expansion would significantly increase overall accessibility, and TOD policy implementation would further increase accessibility in all cities. This study clarified that the desired urban structure of each city, which determines accessibility, significantly differs depending on the size of the city and existing and proposed networks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accessibility; Asian Developing Cities; Covered Population; Transit-oriented Development; Urban Railway Network","","","","A portion of this study in Ahmedabad has been conducted as the part of SATREPS project entitled “Smart Cities Development for Emerging Countries by Multimodal Transport System based on Sensing, Network, and Big Data Analysis of Regional Transportation (JPMJSA1606)” funded by JST and JICA.

We use the national representative data of the Vietnam Demographic Health Survey from 1997 and 2002 to investigate the effect of maternal education on three child health indicators: neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality rates. We took advantage of the tuition fee introduction in the lower secondary school level in 1989 to create an exogenous negative shock of educational environment for women. Our results first show that women who were exposed to the tuition fee introduction, on average, have 0.652 less years of schooling, compared to their counterparts. Using this exogenous reduction in educational attainment, our results show that a one-year reduction in maternal education led to increases in neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality rates by approximately 2.4, 3.0, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. The shorter years of female education possibly hasten her age at first marriage and thus, age at first birth, which would contribute to unmatured and/or risky pregnancy and delivery. The lower education for women further hampers her empowerment in deciding the efficient and effective time and money allocations for better health outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child Mortality; Educational Policy; Iv; Maternal Education; Vndhs; Age At Marriage; Child Mortality; Education Policy; Educational Attainment; Female Education; Human Capital; Infant Mortality; Secondary Education; Viet Nam","age at marriage; child mortality; education policy; educational attainment; female education; human capital; infant mortality; secondary education; Viet Nam","","","I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Miki Kohara, for her invaluable assistance and guidance throughout the research.

Does the answer differ across countries and social classes? To answer these questions in a way that minimizes bias and ethnocentrism, we used open-ended questions to explore ideal-parent beliefs among 8,357 mothers and 3,517 fathers from 37 countries. Leximancer Semantic Network Analysis was utilized to first determine parenting culture zones (i.e., countries with shared ideal-parent beliefs) and then extract the predominant themes and concepts in each culture zone. The results yielded specific types of ideal-parent beliefs in five parenting culture zones: being “responsible and children/family-focused” for Asian parents, being “responsible and proper demeanor-focused” for African parents, and being “loving and responsible” for Hispanic-Italian parents. Although the most important themes and concepts were the same in the final two zones—being “loving and patient,” there were subtle differences: English-speaking, European Union, and Russian parents emphasized “being caring,” while French-speaking parents valued “listening” or being “present.” Ideal-parent beliefs also differed by education levels within culture zones, but no general pattern was discerned across culture zones. These findings suggest that the country in which parents were born cannot fully explain their differences in ideal-parent beliefs and that differences arising from social class or education level cannot be dismissed. Future research should consider how these differences affect the validity of the measurements in question and how they can be incorporated into parenting intervention research within and across cultures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Content Analysis; Parental Beliefs; Positive Parenting; Qualitative And Quantitative Methods; Semantic Network Analysis; African; Article; Asian; Care Behavior; Child; Child Parent Relation; Content Analysis; Education; Educational Status; European Union; Father; Female; Hispanic; Human; Italian (citizen); Male; Mother; Network Analysis; Quantitative Analysis; Russian (citizen); Social Class; Speech; Validity","African; article; Asian; care behavior; child; child parent relation; content analysis; education; educational status; European Union; father; female; Hispanic; human; Italian (citizen); male; mother; network analysis; quantitative analysis; Russian (citizen); social class; speech; validity","","","Funding text 1: The authors thank the International Investigation of Parental Burnout (IIPB) Consortium (https://www.burnoutparental.com/international-consortium) for collecting and providing the data on which this study is based.

In Vietnamese medium-sized cities, the fatality rate has been reported to be 8% higher than the national rate and 19% higher than in larger cities. In addition, private vehicles account for over 90% of travel demand in these cities due to uncontrolled urbanization and the people inhabiting these cities are dependent on motorcycle as a mode of travel. Motorcycle and bicycle riders are the most vulnerable road users, hence those commuting to school by these vehicles are often at risk for crashes. In the present study, a total of 4,358 samples, categorized by ‘self-driving’ and ‘pick-up’ subgroups, were collected and used in the analysis. Of the 2,227 participants in the self-driving group, 313 persons (14.05%) experienced by at least one crash in the preceding year. In the pick-up group, with 2,131 participants, 193 persons (9.06%) experienced at least one crash in the preceding year. Crash model estimation results indicate that the household location, gender with specific age group, motorcycle license, travel characteristics and population density have significant impacts on different levels of the crash outcome in each group. In the mode share model, variables representing crash prevalence, household size, the mobility sources available in the household (for example, the number of bicycles, motorcycles, or cars), household location, gender with specific age group, occupation levels, trip rate, levels of school travel distance, build environment, and some variables of perception, also show significant impacts on different levels of mode choice outcomes in each group. The present study provides an insightful understanding of the behaviors and perception of individuals taking school trips in a medium-sized motorcycle-dependent city. Our results indicate that the culture of using motorcycles is firmly entrenched among citizens and policymakers should attempt to redesign road infrastructure to ensure the safety of motorcycle users in parallel with improving walking and cycling infrastructure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crash Experiences; Influencing Factors; Mode Choice; Residential Location; Safe Infrastructure; School Trips","","","","","Alparone, Francesca Romana, On children's independent mobility: The interplay of demographic, environmental, and psychosocial factors, Children's Geographies, 10, 1, pp. 109-122, (2012); Besser, Lilah M., Walking to public transit: Steps to help meet physical activity recommendations, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 29, 4, pp. 273-280, (2005); undefined, (2004); Easton, Sue, Children's travel to school-the interaction of individual, neighbourhood and school factors, Transport Policy, 44, pp. 9-18, (2015); undefined; Elliott, Michael Roger, The effect of duration and delay of licensure on risk of crash: A Bayesian analysis of repeated time-to-event measures, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 97, 458, pp. 420-431, (2002); Fisher, Donald L., Use of a fixed-base driving simulator to evaluate the effects of experience and PC-based risk awareness training on drivers' decisions, Human Factors, 44, 2, pp. 287-302, (2002); Fusco, Caroline, Toward an understanding of children's perceptions of their transport geographies: (non)active school travel and visual representations of the built environment, Journal of Transport Geography, 20, 1, pp. 62-70, (2012); Fyhri, Aslak, Children's active travel and independent mobility in four countries: Development, social contributing trends and measures, Transport Policy, 18, 5, pp. 703-710, (2011); undefined, (2005)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","2214367X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139834702"

Although several methods of observing the displacement using image processing or laser displacement meters and then estimating the vibration through an observer or a Kalman filter have been developed, it is difficult to install sensors because of the movement of the elevator car and the thinness of the rope as an observation target. Therefore, in this study, we focus on a pulley called a compensating sheave that does not change its lateral position as the car and ropes move. The horizontal vibration of the ropes causes the compensating sheave to vibrate in the vertical direction. A method of estimating the horizontal vibration from this vertical vibration using arc length calculations and a short-time fast Fourier transform is proposed. First, the vertical vibration of the compensating sheave is distributed to the various mode responses based on the predominant frequency of the vertical vibration. The mode-decomposed vertical vibration is then converted into a horizontal mode response using an arc length relational expression. Analysis of seismic response data confirms that the proposed method can estimate the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd horizontal mode responses from the vertical vibration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arc Length; Compensating Sheave; Elevator Rope; Geometric Relationship; State Estimation; Vibration; Carbon Dioxide Arc Welding; Fast Fourier Transforms; Image Processing; Rope; Vibration Analysis; Arc Length; Compensating Sheave; Elevator Ropes; Elevator Shafts; Geometric Relationships; Horizontal Vibration; Lateral Vibrations; Mode Response; Vertical Vibrations; Vibration; Elevator Cables","Carbon dioxide arc welding; Fast Fourier transforms; Image processing; Rope; Vibration analysis; Arc length; Compensating sheave; Elevator ropes; Elevator shafts; Geometric relationships; Horizontal vibration; Lateral vibrations; Mode response; Vertical vibrations; Vibration; Elevator cables","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, grant number 21K14389.

The aims of this research were to: (1) explore the individual- and country-level determinants of intentions to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, and (2) examine worldwide variation in vaccination intentions. This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic, involving 6697 respondents across 20 countries. Results showed that 72.9% of participants reported positive intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19, whereas 16.8% were undecided, and 10.3% reported they would not be vaccinated. At the individual level, prosociality was a significant positive predictor of vaccination intentions, whereas generic beliefs in conspiracy theories and religiosity were negative predictors. Country-level determinants, including cultural dimensions of individualism/collectivism and power distance, were not significant predictors of vaccination intentions. Altogether, this study identifies individual-level predictors that are common across multiple countries, provides further evidence on the importance of combating conspiracy theories, involving religious institutions in vaccination campaigns, and stimulating prosocial motives to encourage vaccine uptake. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19 Vaccines; Sars-cov-2 Vaccine; Behavior; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Human; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Vaccination; Covid-19; Covid-19 Vaccines; Cross-sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; Sars-cov-2; Vaccination","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; human; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination","","COVID-19 Vaccines","This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi [VCDSF/75-71015], The University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III [COV20/00086], co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) ”A way to make Europe.”","Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Solís Arce, Julio S., COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in low- and middle-income countries, Nature Medicine, 27, 8, pp. 1385-1394, (2021); International Review of Social Psychology, (2005); Handbook of Social Psychology, (1998); van Bavel, Jay Joseph, Using social and behavioural science to support COVID-19 pandemic response, Nature Human Behaviour, 4, 5, pp. 460-471, (2020); Böhm, Robert, Exploring and Promoting Prosocial Vaccination: A Cross-Cultural Experiment on Vaccination of Health Care Personnel, BioMed Research International, 2016, (2016); Böhm, Robert, The willingness to vaccinate increases when vaccination protects others who have low responsibility for not being vaccinated, Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 42, 3, pp. 381-391, (2019); Bruder, Martin, Measuring individual differences in generic beliefs in conspiracy theories across cultures: Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Cichocka, Aleksandra, They will not control us': Ingroup positivity and belief in intergroup conspiracies, British Journal of Psychology, 107, 3, pp. 556-576, (2016)","","Routledge","","","","","","15327027; 10410236","038726115X; 9780387261157","","35081848","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124147547"

However, the present prevalence and recent trend in anaemia among this population are unclear. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anaemia among non-pregnant women in Vietnam. Methods: We systematically searched databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and reference lists of earlier prevalence studies from their inception until July 2022. For statistical analysis to check for heterogeneity, random or fixed effects models were employed to summarize the prevalence of anaemia. Visual examination of a funnel plot was used to determine the presence of publication bias, which was then verified using the Egger regression test. Subgroup analyses were also undertaken to evaluate how the proportion of anaemia differs across various study groups. Results: A total of 188 studies were found as a result of the bibliographical search. Finally, of the 12 included studies, anaemia affected 5089 non-pregnant women out of a total of 19 744, making the prevalence of this condition 23.2% (95% CI: 16.1-32.2). From 1995 to 2013, the prevalence of anaemia in this population declined significantly, from 42.6% to 16.9%. Notably, the prevalence of anaemia among non-pregnant women differed by geography and increased by mountains, Northern Vietnam, rural areas, and ethnic minority groups. Furthermore, no publication bias was found in this meta-analysis. Conclusion: To enhance the health of women and meet global objectives for eliminating anaemia, more efforts are required in specific regions and ethnic minority groups in Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaemia; Anemia; Non-pregnancy; Vietnam; Women","","","","","Global Nutrition Targets 2025 Breastfeeding Policy Brief, (2014); WHO Global Anaemia Estimates 2021 Edition Anaemia in Women and Children, (2021); Balarajan, Yarlini S., Anaemia in low-income and middle-income countries, The Lancet, 378, 9809, pp. 2123-2135, (2011); Black, Robert E., Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries, The Lancet, 382, 9890, pp. 427-451, (2013); da Silva Lopes, Katharina, Nutrition-specific interventions for preventing and controlling anaemia throughout the life cycle: An overview of systematic reviews, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2018, 8, (2018); Kassebaum, Nicholas J., A systematic analysis of global anemia burden from 1990 to 2010, Blood, 123, 5, pp. 615-624, (2014); Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal Infant and Young Child Nutrition, (2014); Chaparro, Camila M., Anemia epidemiology, pathophysiology, and etiology in low- and middle-income countries, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1450, 1, pp. 15-31, (2019); Average Population by Location, (2021); Moher, David, Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: The PRISMA statement, BMJ, 339, 7716, pp. 332-336, (2009)","","Tabriz University of Medical Sciences","","","","","","22286497","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148956013"

In this study, the antioxidant, anti-hyperuricemia, and antibacterial properties of kava root were investigated through the isolation and purification of bioactive compounds in ten fractions separated by column chromatography (CC). They included six flavonoids, 5-hydroxy-4′,7-dimethoxyflavanone (C1), matteucinol (C2), isosakuranetin (C3), 5,7- dimethoxyflavanone (C4), 2′,4′-dihydroxy-6′-methoxydihydrochalcone (in MC5) and alpinetin (C10), and seven kavalactones, 5,6-dehydrokawain (DK) (in MC5 and C6), kavain (in MC7), yangonin (in MC7 and C8), dihydro-5,6-dehydrokavain (DDK) (in MC9), 7,8-dihydromethysticin (in MC9), dihydromethysticin (in MC9), methysticin (in MC9). The chemical structures of the compounds were illustrated by the analyses of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (ESI–MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C-NMR), and X-ray diffraction. The evaluation of the free radical scavenging activity of the isolated substances via the DPPH and ABTS assays revealed that C3 (IC<inf>50</inf>: ABTS = 76.5; DPPH = 74.8 µg/mL) possessed the strongest antioxidant property. In terms of anti-hyperuricemia activity evaluated via the xanthine oxidase inhibitory in vitro assay, the compound C10 was the most promising inhibitor, revealing an IC<inf>50</inf> of 134.52 µg/mL. The two kavalactone mixtures in MC5 and a pure compound C6 inhibited the growth of bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, while MC7 can constrain the development of Klebsiella pneumoniae. This is the first study to isolate, purify, and identify the flavonoids isosakuranetin, 2′,4′-dihydroxy-6′-methoxydihydrochalcone and alpinetin in kava root and report their pharmaceutical potential. The identified bioactive compounds showed potent antioxidant, anti-hyperuricemia, and antibacterial activity and thus can enhance the value of beverages and foods derived from kava root. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibacterial Activity; Antioxidant Activity; Beverage; Flavonoid; Kavalactone; Piper Methysticuml","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 104.01-2019.316.","Lobo, Vijaya Chavan, Free radicals, antioxidants and functional foods: Impact on human health, Pharmacognosy Reviews, 4, 8, pp. 118-126, (2010); Alugoju, Phaniendra, Free Radicals: Properties, Sources, Targets, and Their Implication in Various Diseases, Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry, 30, 1, pp. 11-26, (2015); Valko, Marián, Free radicals, metals and antioxidants in oxidative stress-induced cancer, Chemico-Biological Interactions, 160, 1, pp. 1-40, (2006); Birben, Esra, Oxidative stress and antioxidant defense, World Allergy Organization Journal, 5, 1, pp. 9-19, (2012); Conen, David, Prevalence of hyperuricemia and relation of serum uric acid with cardiovascular risk factors in a developing country, BMC Public Health, 4, pp. 1-9, (2004); Xuan, T.

In particular, the global numbers of mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68% from 1970 to 2016. One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably, perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast, perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government’s and international organizations’ funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We would like to send our gratitude to our colleagues, family, and friends for supporting us during the research, especially Prof. Vuong Quan Hoang (Phenikaa University).

However, understanding of service quality and satisfaction relations has been limited. This study seeks an appropriate method to demonstrate the nature of service quality-satisfaction relations. Thereby, research results can be methodologically, theoretically, and empirically defensible. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) and the three-factor theory, the most widely preferred for public transport service quality prioritization based on the importance of service factors to rider satisfaction, will be utilized. The study takes transit service in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, to demonstrate that the three-factor theory, which has been limitedly utilized despite being more advantageous and robust, is superior to the IPA. Although the extent to which the service quality factors affect satisfaction varied across rider segments, the types of service quality factors were found consistent. For example, captive riders considered all service factors as performance. Non-captive riders considered the environment factor as excitement. No basic factor was found across rider groups. This study contributes to the limited understanding of the non-linear and asymmetric relations between service quality and satisfaction of various rider groups, which is rarely found in transit service quality literature. Furthermore, it introduced a case study of Vietnamese urban transit services for the first time. It suggests that enhancing passenger information, rider care, and comfort are recommended as the most practical and economical measures in the short run. However, the city government should improve availability and accessibility to promote public transport ridership in the long run. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Importance-performance Analysis; Public Transport; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segments; Service Quality; Three-factor Theory; Factor Analysis; Quality Control; Importance-performance Analysis; Prioritization; Public Transport; Public Transport Service; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segment; Service Quality; Service Satisfaction; Three-factor Theory; Transit Services; Quality Of Service; Performance Assessment; Prioritization; Public Transport; Service Quality; Strategic Approach; Viet Nam","Factor analysis; Quality control; Importance-performance analysis; Prioritization; Public transport; Public transport service; Rider satisfaction; Rider segment; Service Quality; Service satisfaction; Three-factor theory; Transit services; Quality of service; performance assessment; prioritization; public transport; service quality; strategic approach; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the World Bank for the data.

Checklists are one of the ways that can help students identify the most important pieces of information. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed at examining the impact of using educational checklists on the learning process of postgraduate students at Nagasaki University, Japan. Methods: Thirty-one Master's students, who finished a “how to write a research protocol” course were recruited by sending them an invitation email that had an attached link to a previously developed and tested questionnaire on the SurveyMonkey® platform. After signing the electronic informed consent, twenty-two participants (response rate = 71%) finished the survey. The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and expressed in the form of frequencies and percentages. Results: More than half of the students declared that they know the checklist will be used in the course that we investigated. Only two students used checklists as a means of studying (9%). Twelve students (55%) confirmed that no other courses or lessons in the School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health (TMGH) use checklists. No students found the usage of checklists not easy or not practical to apply. Many students thought the length of the checklist was suitable and not too short (64%), although three students (14%) found it lengthy. Moreover, most students described the checklist as beyond good (86%) and they would recommend using a checklist for teaching other college students (73%). Conclusion: Using checklists in education can facilitate the learning process, help in memorization, and deepen the concepts being studied. Further studies are required to examine the impact of checklists in teaching undergraduate students and students from other non-healthcare disciplines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Checklist; Research Education; Teaching Improvement; Adult; Article; Checklist; Clinical Article; College Student; E-mail; Education; Female; Global Health; Health Survey; Human; Human Experiment; Informed Consent; Japan; Learning; Male; Postgraduate Student; Questionnaire; Research Student; Software; Teaching; Tropical Medicine; Undergraduate Student; Student; University; Checklist; Humans; Learning; Students; Surveys And Questionnaires; Teaching; Universities","adult; article; checklist; clinical article; college student; e-mail; education; female; global health; health survey; human; human experiment; informed consent; Japan; learning; male; postgraduate student; questionnaire; research student; software; teaching; tropical medicine; undergraduate student; student; university; Checklist; Humans; Learning; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Teaching; Universities","","","The authors would like to thank the participants for undertaking this survey that can improve the education of future cohorts.","Checklist Manifesto how to Get Things Right, (2009); Improving Achievement and Student Satisfaction Through Criteria Based Evaluation Checklists and Rubrics in Educational Research Courses, (1999); Nicole Lauzon Via Ldaoeng Checklists and Achievement Charts, (2014); Salinitri, Francine D., Reliability and validity of a checklist to evaluate student performance in a problem-based learning group, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 83, 8, pp. 1712-1722, (2019); Goodman, Daisy J., Feasibility and Acceptability of a Checklist and Learning Collaborative to Promote Quality and Safety in the Perinatal Care of Women with Opioid Use Disorders, Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health, 64, 1, pp. 104-111, (2019); Davis, Ronald L., The Biology of Forgetting—A Perspective, Neuron, 95, 3, pp. 490-503, (2017); Ponds, Rudolf W.H.M., Prevalence and covariates of subjective forgetfulness in a normal population in the Netherlands, International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 45, 3, pp. 207-221, (1997); Sharma, Akash, A Consensus-Based Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS), Journal of General Internal Medicine, 36, 10, pp. 3179-3187, (2021); Hoffman, Kelly Marie, Racial bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations, and false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113, 16, pp. 4296-4301, (2016); Meinema, Jennita G., Intervention Descriptions in Medical Education: What Can Be Improved?

It shows that the conceptual subtleties in the conceptualization of nature often hide wider and deeper cosmological mismatches. It concludes by suggesting that these diverse voices need to be represented in global reports on sustainability, which can be fostered by the direct involvement of experts from diverse traditions of thought who have access and interpretative knowledge of sources in languages other than English. To take into consideration the diversity of conceptualizations of nature can lead to better decisions about sustainability and improve the acceptability and efficiency of environmental policies in each local context, as well as internationally.

Topographical and geological surveys were conducted around the area to determine its causes. The rainfall data and flow discharge were also analyzed. The results showed that this collapse was different from some previous ones collapsed due to the erosion at the toe of the slope. Khanh waterfall landslide occurred due to the increasing amount of water in cracks and caves in the limestone layer in the slope. The collapse process was simulated based on Coulomb mixture theory.

At the same time, the region is facing various challenges, ranging from extreme weather events, saline water intrusion, and other anthropogenic pressures. This study examines how saline water intrusion and drought have affected rice yield in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Applying the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the maximum and minimum values of annual average salinity, we spatially examine the effects of drought and saline water intrusion on rice yields over a 40-year period (1980–2019). Our results highlight that 42% of the natural land area of the VMD has experienced increased drought occurrence during the winter-spring (WS) rice cropping season, while certain inland regions have additionally experienced increased drought occurrence during the summer-autumn (SA) rice cropping season. The Tri Ton Station, which has a significant Sen’s slope of −0.025 and a p-value of 0.05, represents an upstream semi-mountainous part of the delta, indicative of a rising severity of reoccurring drought. It should be noted that the yield decreases during the summer-autumn season as the positive SPI_SA increases. Salinity, on the other hand, is associated with SPI_WS during the winter-spring season.

H<inf>2</inf>S emission control in sewers via chemically or biologically normal oxidation processes has also been investigated extensively and is costly. The objective of this work was to develop a new technology to mitigate the concentration of H<inf>2</inf>S in sewer pipes using conductive concrete. Experimental results after 66 days show that the concentration of hydrogen sulfide significantly decreased when conductive concrete was used as a microbial fuel cell. Both ordinary Portland cement and conductive concrete were utilized for the target experiment. Elemental sulfur was observed in the coating sludge of conductive concrete, whereas this trend was not observed for ordinary Portland cement. These observations demonstrate that conductive concrete provides an electron pathway from deposited sludge in the bottom of sewer pipes to oxygen dissolved in surface water electrons generated from hydrogen sulfide oxidation in an anaerobic environment via conductive concrete. Finally, regarding the mechanism responsible for hydrogen sulfide oxidation, chemical oxidation was the dominant process, and biological processes did not play a significant role. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorphous Carbon; Conductive Concrete; Elemental Sulfur; Hydrogen Sulfide; Sewer Pipe; Amorphous Carbon; Concretes; Dissolved Oxygen; Localized Corrosion; Methane; Microbial Fuel Cells; Oxidation; Portland Cement; Sulfur Determination; Surface Waters; Biogenic Corrosion; Conductive Concrete; Elemental Sulphur; Emissions Control; Localised; Ordinary Portland Cement; Oxidation Process; Sewer Corrosions; Sewer Pipes; Urban Sewer System; Hydrogen Sulfide; Biological Processes; Concrete; Corrosion; Emission Control; Fuel Cell; Hydrogen Sulfide; Oxidation; Pipe; Sulfur; Surface Water","Amorphous carbon; Concretes; Dissolved oxygen; Localized corrosion; Methane; Microbial fuel cells; Oxidation; Portland cement; Sulfur determination; Surface waters; Biogenic corrosion; Conductive concrete; Elemental sulphur; Emissions control; Localised; Ordinary Portland cement; Oxidation process; Sewer corrosions; Sewer pipes; Urban sewer system; Hydrogen sulfide; biological processes; concrete; corrosion; emission control; fuel cell; hydrogen sulfide; oxidation; pipe; sulfur; surface water","","","This research was funded a part by JSPS KAKENHI (20K04749); GAIA Project, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (No. 4).","Firer, Dan, Control of sulfide in sewer systems by dosage of iron salts: Comparison between theoretical and experimental results, and practical implications, Science of the Total Environment, 392, 1, pp. 145-156, (2008); Gutierrez, Oriol, Evaluation of oxygen injection as a means of controlling sulfide production in a sewer system, Water Research, 42, 17, pp. 4549-4561, (2008); Gutierrez, Oriol, Assessment of pH shock as a method for controlling sulfide and methane formation in pressure main sewer systems, Water Research, 48, 1, pp. 569-578, (2014); Jiang, Guangming, Optimization of intermittent, simultaneous dosage of nitrite and hydrochloric acid to control sulfide and methane productions in sewers, Water Research, 45, 18, pp. 6163-6172, (2011); Jiang, Guangming, Dosing free nitrous acid for sulfide control in sewers: Results of field trials in Australia, Water Research, 47, 13, pp. 4331-4339, (2013); Sun, Xiaoyan, A novel and simple treatment for control of sulfide induced sewer concrete corrosion using free nitrous acid, Water Research, 70, pp. 279-287, (2015); Li, Xuan, Mitigation of Microbially Influenced Corrosion of Concrete Sewers Using Nitrite, pp. 119-135, (2022); Pikaar, Ilje, Full-scale investigation of in-situ iron and alkalinity generation for efficient sulfide control, Water Research, 167, (2019); Nemati, Mehdi, Mechanistic study of microbial control of hydrogen sulfide production in oil reservoirs, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 74, 5, pp. 424-434, (2001); Lee, Eun-ku, Liquid-phase oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur over CuO/MgO catalyst, Reaction Kinetics and Catalysis Letters, 87, 1, pp. 115-120, (2005)","","MDPI","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141834138"

Therefore, this epidemiological study examined the role of body weight in the relationship between hypertension and depressive symptoms among the middle-aged and elderly living in the community of Shika town. In total, 1141 males and 1142 females with mean ages of 69.09 and 70.61 years, respectively, participated this study. Physiological factors, including blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle, were investigated in a medical check-up in Shika town. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale 15 (GDS-15). A two-way analysis of covariance exhibited a significant interaction between the two hypertensive groups and body size groups on GDS in females. The post hoc Bonferroni method showed that in the hypertensive groups, GDS was significantly higher in the underweight group (BMI < 18.5) than in the standard/overweight group; however, this relationship was not observed in the no-hypertensive groups. Multiple regression analysis also verified this relationship. Therefore, it is suggested that the combination of hypertension and being underweight is associated with depressive symptoms only in females. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Cross-sectional Study; Geriatric Depression Scale; Multiple Regression Analysis","","","","This study was funded by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific and Technology-Japan (Research project/Area number: 19H03882).","Terlizzi, Emily P., Mental Health Treatment Among Adults: United States, 2019, National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, 380, pp. 1-8, (2020); Zhang, Melvyn W.B., Prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression, General Hospital Psychiatry, 33, 3, pp. 217-223, (2011); Lu, Yanxia, Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents with asthma: A meta-analysis and meta-regression, Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, 23, 8, pp. 707-715, (2012); Ho, Chun Man Roger, Clinical and psychosocial factors associated with depression and anxiety in Singaporean patients with rheumatoid arthritis, International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 14, 1, pp. 37-47, (2011); Rantanen, Ansa Talvikki, Awareness of hypertension and depressive symptoms: a cross-sectional study in a primary care population, Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care, 36, 3, pp. 323-328, (2018); Ma, Chunhua, The prevalence of depressive symptoms and associated factors in countryside-dwelling older Chinese patients with hypertension, Journal of Clinical Nursing, 27, 15-16, pp. 2933-2941, (2018); Bergantin, Leandro Bueno, Depression rises the risk of hypertension incidence: discussing the link through the Ca2+/cAMP signalling, Current Hypertension Reviews, 16, 1, pp. 73-78, (2020); Li, Zhanzhan, Prevalence of depression in patients with hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Medicine (United States), 94, 31, (2015); Scalco, Andréia Zavaloni, Hypertension and depression., Clinics, 60, 3, pp. 241-250, (2005); Kim, Jinseok, Body mass index and depressive symptoms in older adults: A cross-lagged panel analysis, PLOS ONE, 9, 12, (2014)","","MDPI","","","","","","2076328X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141807128"

This study proposed a simple model for rainfall-induced shallow landslide prediction in broad areas based on an infinite homogeneous slope assumption and a simplified hydrological process. For this purpose, a numerical model, TAG_FLOW, was developed in Fortran 90. Its structure was divided into four modules: (1) a surface infiltration module based on the Green-Ampt model, (2) a groundwater-level simulation based on a previously developed simple one-dimensional vertical prediction method combined with horizontal groundwater distribution, (3) a surface water control module based on two-dimensional shallow water equations and a depression removal process, and (4) slope stability estimated using the assumption of an infinite homogeneous slope. The simplified hydrological process for the surface and subsurface flows was validated using a tilted V-catchment model and tested with the Abdul and Gillham system. For the performance evaluation of TAG_FLOW, we applied the model to analyze rainfall-induced landslides for an area in North Kyushu during the historically large torrential rainfall event in July 2017. The landslide prediction capacity of the TAG_FLOW model was evaluated by the TRIGRS model and the actual landslide map. The results confirmed that both groundwater and surface water contributed to the occurrence of landslides in the study area. The prediction performance of the TAG_FLOW model was slightly better than that of the TRIGRS model, but both models overpredicted landslides in the study area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Shallow Landslide Model; Simplified Hydrological Process; Surface And Subsurface Flows; Wide-area Analysis; Catchments; Equations Of Motion; Forecasting; Groundwater; Rain; Surface Waters; Ground Water Level; Homogeneous Slope; Hydrological Process; Landslide Prediction; Module-based; Shallow Landslide; Shallow Landslide Model; Simplified Hydrological Process; Surface And Subsurface Flow; Wide-area Analyse; Landslides; Groundwater; Infiltration; Landslide; Performance Assessment; Prediction; Rainfall; Shallow-water Equation; Slope Stability; Subsurface Flow; Terrain","Catchments; Equations of motion; Forecasting; Groundwater; Rain; Surface waters; Ground water level; Homogeneous slope; Hydrological process; Landslide prediction; Module-based; Shallow landslide; Shallow landslide model; Simplified hydrological process; Surface and subsurface flow; Wide-area analyse; Landslides; groundwater; infiltration; landslide; performance assessment; prediction; rainfall; shallow-water equation; slope stability; subsurface flow; terrain","","","This research was supported by a Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology scholarship and a Japan Science and Technology Agency Strategic International Collaborative Research Program grant (e-ASIA Joint Research Program), titled “Establishment of a Landslide Monitoring and Prediction System” (Grant JPMJSC18E3).

Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed to gain insight into factors driving household rehabilitation. The findings accentuated improvements in women's post-flood resilience as a result of effective interventions from communities, authorities and NGOs. Diversifying livelihoods into the non-agricultural sector was also an important factor to shorten the rehabilitation processes. Additionally, the results emphasized the efficacy of social interactions, notably between relatives and informal groups, after floods. The potential negative consequences of reliance on government support in household rehabilitation efforts are also preliminarily discussed.

In terms of research trends, this study identified three emerging areas of studies that are relatively under-researched, namely natural resources, technology, and urbanization. As for publishing practices, There is also a positive sign for the adoption of open science among Vietnamese researchers in this field. The findings are useful for predicting future research trends. In addition, the study provides several implications for policymakers in Vietnam to enhance research capacity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bibliometrics; Development Economics; Open Access; Vietnam Scientific Productivity","","","","The authors would like to thank the research staff at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Social Research, Phenikaa University, namely Nguyen To Hong Kong, Nguyen Minh Hoang, La Viet Phuong, Le Tam Tri and Nguyen Thanh Thanh Huyen.","undefined, (2019); Anwar, Sajid, Foreign direct investment and economic growth in Vietnam, Asia Pacific Business Review, 16, 1-2, pp. 183-202, (2010); Anwar, Sajid, Foreign direct investment and trade: The case of Vietnam, Research in International Business and Finance, 25, 1, pp. 39-52, (2011); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Natural Disasters, Household Welfare, and Resilience: Evidence from Rural Vietnam, World Development, 70, pp. 59-77, (2015); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Does urbanization reduce rural poverty?

One of the most popular of these solutions is to add surplus components to the subsystems of a system (known as RRAP) and the reliability-redundancy allocation problem. In a subsystem, how these surplus components are used is of particular importance. How to use surplus components in the subsystem is known as. There are three general strategies for reliability issues known as active, stored, and mixed strategy. The main aim of the study is to create a new formula on the basis of the subsystems that use these two strategies. Model 4 provides a continuous limit of the Markov chain with continuous time. This new formula enables us to perform complex strategy calculations in a very short time and accurately. Finally the exact function obtained for mixed strategy Protective system ultra-fast gas turbine has been tested.

As the dominant mode of transportation in last-mile delivery (LMD) services in Vietnam, cargo MCs are found throughout the country. However, little is known about the risk of crashes involving cargo MC drivers, the factors affecting road crashes, and the perceived risk of crashes among cargo MC drivers. This information is vital given the rising safety concerns and the economic losses due to traffic crashes in the country. This study characterized traffic crashes involving cargo MCs as being either minor or major. Specifically, our survey of 726 cargo MC drivers in Hanoi showed that 42.01% of respondents had experienced a crash within the last year, and 13.37% of respondents had been involved in at least one major traffic crash. Competition for work and unsafe driving behavior were the main reasons underlying these risks. Crash severity varied depending on the number of years that the drivers had worked in LMD, job type, income perception, delivery pressure, smoking and drinking habits, and mobile phone usage. Major crashes were also associated with the distance travelled daily and the number of trips to the distribution hub. Conversely, working overtime, lack of rest stops, daily order status, and traffic violations were associated with minor crashes. These findings suggest that cargo MC drivers face numerous risks and that efforts to address these challenges are urgently required in order to promote the adoption of sustainable and healthy shipment practices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cargo Motorcycle; Last Mile Delivery; Safety; Traffic Crash","","","","This study is based on research supported by Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology and German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Project No. NDT/DE/21/300.

The method combines linguistic filtering based on our defined open patterns with nested term extraction and statistical ranking using C-value. It does not require annotated corpora, external data resources, parameter settings, or term length restriction. Beside its specialty in handling Vietnamese medical terms, another novelty is that it uses Pointwise Mutual Information to split nested terms and the disjunctive acceptance condition to extract them. Evaluated on real Vietnamese electronic medical records, it achieves a precision of about 74% and recall of about 92% and is proved stably effective with small datasets. It outperforms the previous works in the same category of not using annotated corpora and external data resources.

Face-to-face interview methods were used to investigate the current status of construction and demolition waste (CDW) management (collection, transportation, treatment, and storage) as well as reveal attitudes of governmental agencies and enterprises towards CDW recycling and recycled material products in Hai Phong City, Vietnam. Waste generation rates (WGRs) of the works were also determined by site surveys and as-built drawings method of typical old buildings to be demolished and two licensed new construction works. WGRs of 34.5 kg/m2 and 758 kg/m2 were identified during the construction and demolition of small private houses, respectively, while WGRs at public house demolition sites were 1053 kg/m2. To effectively manage the CDW, the gross floor area of new construction work was estimated by a multiple regression equation with the population and gross region domestic product growth. Based on this model combining the investigation results, the amount of CDW increase in 5–30 years is also predicted.

This dataset was compiled during the COVID-19 pandemic by a network of hospitals that collect data using the ISARIC-World Health Organization Clinical Characterization Protocol and data tools. The database includes data from more than 705,000 patients, collected in more than 60 countries and 1,500 centres worldwide. Patient data are available from acute hospital admissions with COVID-19 and outpatient follow-ups.

Past research has placed a focus on the combination of this method and narrow reading, or the use of this method in teaching languages other than English. This study explored narrow listening as an independent method to improve EFL learners’ listening comprehension. The 38 participants in this study were intermediate EFL adult learners following a general English course. During the experiment, the treatment group were provided with narrow listening materials, while the control group were given listening exercises as homework. A pre-test and a post-test were used to measure the participants’ listening comprehension. The results indicated that the treatment group outperformed the control group on the post-test. Compared to their control group counterparts, the narrow listening learners gained significantly greater comprehension of the oral texts, even those about the topics they had not practiced during the treatment. The findings have suggested that narrow listening has a positive impact on EFL learners’ listening competence and that repetition in listening is advantageous to language acquisition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efl Listening; Input Repetition; Listening Comprehension; Listening Skills; Narrow Listening","","","","","Theoretical Models and Processes of Reading, (1994); Listening, (1988); British Journal of Education, (2015); Memoirs of the Osaka Institute of Technology, (2007); Boyle, Joseph P., Sex Differences in Listening Vocabulary, Language Learning, 37, 2, pp. 273-284, (1987); Teaching Listening, (2006); Assessing Listening, (2001); International Journal of Foreign Language Teaching Ijelt, (2005); Tlemc Teaching and Learning English in Multicultural Contexts, (2017); Chang, Anna Ching Shyang, EFFECTS of NARROW READING and LISTENING on L2 VOCABULARY LEARNING, Studies in Second Language Acquisition, 41, 4, pp. 769-794, (2019)","","Chulalongkorn University Language Institute","","","","","","22870024; 01252488","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148293562"

FOS extracted from rice bran and dissolved in buffers at pH values of 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 were prepared for the thermal treatments. The residual FOS (including 1-kestose (GF2), nystose (GF3), and 1F-fructofuranosylnystose (GF4)) contents were determined using the ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method. The results showed that the thermal degradation kinetics of GF2, GF3, and GF4 followed a first-order kinetic model. Thermal degradation rate constants (k values) of GF2, GF3, and GF4 at different temperature and pH values were estimated using the first-order kinetic equation and SAS 9.1. As a result, these k values decreased gradually as the pH of the sample increased from 5.0 to 7.0. The Arrhenius model was applied to describe the heat dependence of the k-values. The activation energy (E<inf>a</inf>) was calculated for each case of GF2, GF3, and GF4 degradation at pH values of 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. The result showed that rice bran FOS is very thermostable at neutral pH while more labile at acidic pH. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1-fructosyl-nystose; 1-kestose; Fos; Fructooligosaccharides; Nystose; Rice Bran; Thermal Degradation Kinetics; Uplc-esi-ms/ms","","","","This research was funded in part by (i) the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14-P6, supported by Japanese ODA loan, (ii) the ‘Study on the change of nutritional composition and the diversity of beverage products for humans from rice bran source’ Project No. B2019-TKG-05, supported by MOET of Vietnam.","Campbell, Joy M., Selected Fructooligosaccharide (1-Kestose, Nystose, and 1F-β-Fructofuranosylnystose) Composition of Foods and Feeds, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 45, 8, pp. 3076-3082, (1997); L'Homme, C., Kinetics of hydrolysis of fructooligosaccharides in mineral-buffered aqueous solutions: Influence of pH and temperature, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 51, 1, pp. 224-228, (2003); Sabater Molina, Maria, Dietary fructooligosaccharides and potential benefits on health, Journal of Physiology and Biochemistry, 65, 3, pp. 315-328, (2009); Bibas Bonet, María Eugenia, Prebiotic effect of yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) on intestinal mucosa using a mouse model, Food and Agricultural Immunology, 21, 2, pp. 175-189, (2010); Sivieri, Katia, Prebiotic effect of fructooligosaccharide in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME® model), Journal of Medicinal Food, 17, 8, pp. 894-901, (2014); Gibson, G.

In the experiments, shear strain, acceleration, pore water pressure, and saturation degree were monitored and measured to provide an understanding of the failure mechanism of the model embankment with different fine particle contents during post-rainfall earthquakes. The results show that the increase in the fines content of the volcanic soil reduces the permeability of the volcanic embankment but has no signif-icant effect on rainfall-induced slope failure until the shear strain is less than 6%.

In view of the high and increasing prevalence of diabetes, we aimed to quantify the burden of type 2 diabetes attributable to PM<inf>2·5</inf> originating from ambient and household air pollution. Methods: We systematically compiled all relevant cohort and case-control studies assessing the effect of exposure to household and ambient fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2·5</inf>) air pollution on type 2 diabetes incidence and mortality. We derived an exposure–response curve from the extracted relative risk estimates using the MR-BRT (meta-regression—Bayesian, regularised, trimmed) tool. The estimated curve was linked to ambient and household PM<inf>2·5</inf> exposures from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019, and estimates of the attributable burden (population attributable fractions and rates per 100 000 population of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years) for 204 countries from 1990 to 2019 were calculated. We also assessed the role of changes in exposure, population size, age, and type 2 diabetes incidence in the observed trend in PM<inf>2·5</inf>-attributable type 2 diabetes burden. All estimates are presented with 95% uncertainty intervals. Findings: In 2019, approximately a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes was attributable to PM<inf>2·5</inf> exposure, with an estimated 3·78 (95% uncertainty interval 2·68–4·83) deaths per 100 000 population and 167 (117–223) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 000 population. Approximately 13·4% (9·49–17·5) of deaths and 13·6% (9·73–17·9) of DALYs due to type 2 diabetes were contributed by ambient PM2·5, and 6·50% (4·22–9·53) of deaths and 5·92% (3·81–8·64) of DALYs by household air pollution. High burdens, in terms of numbers as well as rates, were estimated in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Since 1990, the attributable burden has increased by 50%, driven largely by population growth and ageing. Globally, the impact of reductions in household air pollution was largely offset by increased ambient PM<inf>2·5</inf>. Interpretation: Air pollution is a major risk factor for diabetes. We estimated that about a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes is attributable PM<inf>2·5</inf> pollution. Air pollution mitigation therefore might have an essential role in reducing the global disease burden resulting from type 2 diabetes.

In the capital of Vietnam, Hanoi, the municipal government is facing a number of difficulties in providing sufficient water in a sustainable manner due to the increasing urban population and the serious pollution of both surface and groundwater resources, but this is also due to a lack of resources to invest in the supply system. This study aimed to investigate water users’ willingness to pay for the improvement of Hanoi’s domestic water supply system. A contingent valuation process based on a survey of 402 respondents was used to explore citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the improvement of their urban water supply. The results show that Hanoi’s urban communities (more than 90%) were generally satisfied with the quantity of their water supply, but tended to be dissatisfied with its quality, with 80% of the respondents using advanced water purifiers before drinking and cooking. Respondents were also concerned about the overall reliability of the service, with 40% of respondents indicating that they received no check and maintenance service. A WTP regression model was developed based on the survey findings. The average WTP is 281,000 dong/household/month (approximately 12.2 USD at the exchange rate of 1 USD to about 23,000 VND), equivalent to 1.4% of the average household income at the end of 2019, indicating the level of affordability of monthly water payments among Hanoi citizens. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cvm-based Process; Hanoi; Theoretical Regression Framework; Urban Domestic Water Supply; Vietnam; Willingness To Pay; Developing Countries; Economic Analysis; Groundwater; Groundwater Pollution; Groundwater Resources; Potable Water; Regression Analysis; Water Supply; Cvm-based Process; Domestic Water Supply; Domestic Water Supply System; Government Is; Hanoi; Municipal Government; Theoretical Regression Framework; Urban Domestic Water Supply; Viet Nam; Willingness To Pay; Surveys; Developing World; Drinking Water; Groundwater Resource; Household Expenditure; Household Income; Regression Analysis; Urban Population; Water Resource; Water Supply; Willingness To Pay","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Potable water; Regression analysis; Water supply; CVM-based process; Domestic water supply; Domestic water supply system; Government IS; Hanoi; Municipal government; Theoretical regression framework; Urban domestic water supply; Viet Nam; Willingness to pay; Surveys; developing world; drinking water; groundwater resource; household expenditure; household income; regression analysis; urban population; water resource; water supply; willingness to pay","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the Vingroup Innovation Foundation, grant number VI-NIF.2019.DA17 and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NE/S002847/1).; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Vingroup Innovation Foundation, grant number VI-NIF.2019.DA17 and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NE/S002847/1).","Water Scarcity, (2025); Vairavamoorthy, Kalanithy, Managing urban water supplies in developing countries - Climate change and water scarcity scenarios, Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, 33, 5, pp. 330-339, (2008); He, Chunyang, Future global urban water scarcity and potential solutions, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Coping with Water Scarcity Challenge of the Twenty First Century, (2007); Suzenet, Gaetane, Sustainable water management for the city: Technologies for improving domestic water supply, Built Environment, 28, 2, pp. 138-151, (2002); Hutton, Guy, Global cost-benefit analysis of water supply and sanitation interventions, Journal of Water and Health, 5, 4, pp. 481-501, (2007); Briscoe, John, The financing of hydropower, irrigation and water supply infrastructure in developing countries, International Journal of Water Resources Development, 15, 4, pp. 459-491, (1999); Microeconomic Analysis, (1992); Platt, Jonathan, Willingness and ability to pay for rural water, pp. 157-160, (1994); Al-Ghuraiz, Yusof, Ability and willingness to pay for water supply service in the Gaza Strip, Building and Environment, 40, 8, pp. 1093-1102, (2005)","","MDPI","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133730663"

Using a common RF feeder for multiple transmitter coils reduces the power electronic redundancy compared to a conventional system, where each transmitter coil is individually driven by one switched-mode power supply. Currently, wireless charging of electric vehicles is recommended to operate in the frequency range of 85 kHz and beyond. In this frequency range, the signal wavelength is shorter than about 3.5 km. Therefore, a charging pad longer than several hundred meters is subject to the standing wave effect. In such a case, the voltage significantly varies along the RF feeder, resulting in a variation in the received power level when the receiver moves. Specifically, the received power significantly deteriorates when the receiver is nearby a node of the voltage standing wave. In this paper, we employ a pair of two power sources which are electrically separated by an odd-integer number of the quarter wavelength to drive the RF feeder. As a result, the voltage standing wave generated by one power source is complemented by that of the other, leading to stable received power and transmission efficiency at all the receiver’s positions along with the charging pad. Simulation results at the 85 kHz frequency band verify the output power stabilization effect of the proposed design. It is worth noting that the proposed concept can also be applied to simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags by raising the operation frequency to higher industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands, e.g., 13.56 MHz and employing similar modulation methods as in the current RFID technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Common Rf Feeder; Dual Power Supply; Dynamic Charging; Standing Wave","","","","This work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI under Grant Nos. 20K14736 and 19K04376.","Yilmaz, Murat, Review of battery charger topologies, charging power levels, and infrastructure for plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 5, pp. 2151-2169, (2013); Choi, Suyong, Advances in wireless power transfer systems for roadway-powered electric vehicles, IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, 3, 1, pp. 18-36, (2015); Shin, Jaegue, Design and implementation of shaped magnetic-resonance-based wireless power transfer system for roadway-powered moving electric vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 61, 3, pp. 1179-1192, (2014); Xia, Nenghong, Integrated receiver with high misalignment tolerance used in dynamic wireless charging, IET Electric Power Applications, 14, 10, pp. 1918-1924, (2020); Vu, Van Binh, A High-Power Multiphase Wireless Dynamic Charging System with Low Output Power Pulsation for Electric Vehicles, IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, 8, 4, pp. 3592-3608, (2020); Covic, Grant Anthony, Inductive power transfer, Proceedings of the IEEE, 101, 6, pp. 1276-1289, (2013); Miller, John Michael, Demonstrating dynamic wireless charging of an electric vehicle: The benefit of electrochemical capacitor smoothing, IEEE Power Electronics Magazine, 1, 1, pp. 12-24, (2014); Zhu, Qingwei, Applying LCC Compensation Network to Dynamic Wireless EV Charging System, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 63, 10, pp. 6557-6567, (2016); Lee, Wooyoung, Finite-width magnetic mirror models of mono and dual coils for wireless electric vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 3, pp. 1413-1428, (2013); Covic, Grant Anthony, Modern trends in inductive power transfer for transportation applications, IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, 1, 1, pp. 28-41, (2013)","","ZTE Communications","","","","","","16735188","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210734286"

Understanding impurity levels is crucial in the context of the proliferation of circular economy policies, expected high recycling rates, and growth of scrap consumption. By assuming the accumulation of impurities to be equal worldwide, the understanding of the extent and variation of the mixing and accumulation was limited in previous studies, and the factors influencing those variations were not considered. This is a first cross-national comparison of impurity accumulation in recycled steel. In this study, the copper, tin, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum content was analyzed in over 500 samples of electric arc furnace rebars from China, Japan, Vietnam, Ukraine, and the Netherlands (representing northwestern Europe) with an optical emission spectrometer. The impurity content in rebars represents the content of impurities accumulated in steel scrap in the countries studied. The measured content of impurities was then used to determine the factors influencing the accumulation of those impurities. It was revealed that the recycling technology, the presence of a market for recovered metals, the quality of the material input, steelmaking practices, and the management of byproducts derived from a legislative or economic context played a role in the impurities content. By communicating on scrap chemical content, the collaboration between the recycling and steel industries could be enhanced in terms of matching the demand and supply and facilitating an increase in the scrap share in steelmaking. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Industrial Ecology; Materials Management; Recycling; Scrap; Steel; Tramp Metal; Electric Arcs; Electric Furnaces; Mixing; Scrap Metal Reprocessing; Steel Scrap; Steelmaking; Circular Economy; Impurities Contents; Impurities In; Impurity Level; Industrial Ecology; International Comparison; Materials Management; Recycling Rate; Scrap; Tramp Metal; Recycling; Byproduct; International Comparison; Recycling; Steel; Trace Metal; China; Japan; Netherlands; Ukraine","Electric arcs; Electric furnaces; Mixing; Scrap metal reprocessing; Steel scrap; Steelmaking; Circular economy; Impurities contents; Impurities in; Impurity level; Industrial ecology; International comparison; Materials management; Recycling rate; Scrap; Tramp metal; Recycling; byproduct; international comparison; recycling; steel; trace metal; China; Japan; Netherlands; Ukraine","","","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge Betonstaal.nl for providing samples and comments and reviewers for feedback and suggestions for the development of the analysis.

This led to a rapid increase in solid waste generation,leading to problems and challenges in solid waste collection and management. This problem is alsobeing experienced by other developing countries of the world. Despite the existence of establishedwaste management strategies, targets set for the collection of recyclable waste have not been met.This study introduces solutions to the problems and challenges faced by the waste managementsector in Hoi An city and other developing countries. This study aimed to i) optimize the map of therecovery recycling stations in an urban community, ii) develop an effective solid waste collectionsystem, and iii) provide management tools to enhance recycling activities, contributing to improvingwaste management in Hoi An city.METHODS: The RRSs were integrated into a solid waste collection system in the urban communitiesof Hoi An City, were conducted through location-allocation analysis in a geographic informationsystem environment. Routing problems of carts were solved in the combination of the reschedulingof existing solid waste collection activities in the study site. The economic evaluation by scenarioswas also calculated for ten years to assess the feasibility of scenarios.FINDINGS: Thirty-four locations were identified and optimized to accommodate the RRSs and newcollection routes. The distances travelled and working time increased in proportion to the increasein waste separation effectiveness. Waste separation is vital to the effectiveness of the new solidwaste collection system. The optimal solid waste practice model (in scenarios 2 and 4) revealedthe positive results in improving the solid waste collection system, operating economy, and localadaptation.CONCLUSION: This study redesigned the solid waste collection system to solve the current problemsin the tourism destination of Hoi An city. This study contributed as a case study of integrating urbanrecovery recycling stations into optimizing a solid waste collection system in a tourism destination.Introducing strict waste separation was the pivotal first step in systematically upgrading the solidwaste collection system in Hoi An City. This study’s findings provide government officials and serviceproviders with methods that can be applied to solve the problems faced by Hoi An city’s existingsolid waste collection and management system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geographic Information System; Hoi An; Optimization; Recovery Recycling Stations (rrss); Solid Waste Collection; Vehicle Routing Problem; Gis; Optimization; Solid Waste; Tourism Development; Tourist Destination; Waste Disposal; Waste Management; Hoi An; Viet Nam","GIS; optimization; solid waste; tourism development; tourist destination; waste disposal; waste management; Hoi An; Viet Nam","","","This?study?was?supported?by?Hoi?An?Public?

Methods: Interviews with five diabetic patients were conducted at a tertiary general hospital located in southern Vietnam. The transcribed data were first subjected to quantitative text analysis using KH Coder to identify major categories of frequently used words, followed by a qualitative analysis of selected cases using the Steps for Coding and Theorization (SCAT) method. Results: The major categories of frequently used words were chronic health conditions, services, facilities, insurance, patient-doctor communication, and medication. SCAT analysis of three selected cases identified six themes: “Disregarding the disease at the early stage,” “Fear of complications,” “Satisfaction with hospital services and medical staff,” “Insurance-related problems,” “Long waiting times,” and “Communication barriers between patients and doctors.” Patients were satisfied with improved hospital facilities and services; however, the overloading of one hospital led to long waiting times and communication difficulties with doctors. Difficulties with health insurance were also observed, and patients were rather passive in disease management and needed to be empowered through improved communication with doctors and other care providers. Conclusion: These findings from our trial of introducing a qualitative study into service evaluation suggest that listening to patients can help health providers learn their perspectives and be more responsive to their needs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diabetes; Qualitative Study; Quality Of Care; Quality Of Life; Vietnam","","","","This project was supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency Partnership Program Promoting Evidence-based Patient-centered Health Services in Southern Vietnam: University and Medical Association Partnership Initiative (PI: AG) and in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 20K10539) (Co-PI: AG, PI: Hirohide Yokokawa at Juntendo University).","Binh, Tran Quang, Knowledge and Associated Factors Towards Type 2 Diabetes Among a Rural Population in the Red River Delta Region, Vietnam, Rural and Remote Health, 15, 3, pp. 1-12, (2015); Burge, Peter, Do patients always prefer quicker treatment?

However, to our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the temperature variability-related mortality burden worldwide. In this study, using data from the MCC Collaborative Research Network, we first explored the association between temperature variability and mortality across 43 countries or regions. Then, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the global burden of mortality associated with temperature variability, global gridded temperature data with a resolution of 0·5° × 0·5° were used to assess the temperature variability-related mortality burden at the global, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, temporal trends in temperature variability-related mortality burden were also explored from 2000–19. Methods: In this modelling study, we applied a three-stage meta-analytical approach to assess the global temperature variability-related mortality burden at a spatial resolution of 0·5° × 0·5° from 2000–19. Temperature variability was calculated as the SD of the average of the same and previous days’ minimum and maximum temperatures. We first obtained location-specific temperature variability related-mortality associations based on a daily time series of 750 locations from the Multi-country Multi-city Collaborative Research Network. We subsequently constructed a multivariable meta-regression model with five predictors to estimate grid-specific temperature variability related-mortality associations across the globe. Finally, percentage excess in mortality and excess mortality rate were calculated to quantify the temperature variability-related mortality burden and to further explore its temporal trend over two decades. Findings: An increasing trend in temperature variability was identified at the global level from 2000 to 2019. Globally, 1 753 392 deaths (95% CI 1 159 901–2 357 718) were associated with temperature variability per year, accounting for 3·4% (2·2–4·6) of all deaths. Most of Asia, Australia, and New Zealand were observed to have a higher percentage excess in mortality than the global mean. Globally, the percentage excess in mortality increased by about 4·6% (3·7–5·3) per decade. The largest increase occurred in Australia and New Zealand (7·3%, 95% CI 4·3–10·4), followed by Europe (4·4%, 2·2–5·6) and Africa (3·3, 1·9–4·6). Interpretation: Globally, a substantial mortality burden was associated with temperature variability, showing geographical heterogeneity and a slightly increasing temporal trend. Our findings could assist in raising public awareness and improving the understanding of the health impacts of temperature variability.

To avoid depleting natural granular materials, recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) from construction and demolition waste are now commonly used as an alternative. The mechanical behavior of RCA used in road construction is highly influ-enced by field conditions such as traffic load and moisture variation. The particle breakage of RCA influences long-term pavement performance because it changes the RCA grading over time. How-ever, the effect of moisture content (m.c.) on mechanical behavior and particle breakage during compaction and cyclic loading is often neglected. The aims of the study were to investigate the mechanism of permanent deformation development due to moisture change, the breakage response of RCA in this process, and the assessment of existing permanent deformation prediction model. The results showed that initial m.c. effectively controlled the deformation of RCA; the permanent axial strain (εpa) was enhanced, and the breakage of coarse fraction (19~9.5 mm) under cyclic loading was reduced at higher levels of m.c. Based on the experimental results, a modified model for predicting εpa was proposed, incorporating a deviation factor induced by m.c. The model fitted the experimental data well, suggesting that it is useful to have a quantitative estimation of εpa of RCA with different m.c. under cyclic loading. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyclic Loading; Moisture; Pavement; Permanent Deformation; Recycled Concrete Aggregates; Breakage; Compaction; Cyclic Loading; Deformation; Demolition; Infrastructure Planning; Moisture Content; Pavement; Road Construction","breakage; compaction; cyclic loading; deformation; demolition; infrastructure planning; moisture content; pavement; road construction","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was partially supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on science, and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

This paper investigates the effects of NTMs on Vietnamese exports. It considers NTMs imposed by importing countries and by the Vietnamese government itself. We find that for importing countries' NTMs the technical measures have a positive effect on Vietnamese exports, especially intermediate goods. Final products seem to be the target of non-technical measures used by importing countries. With regard to Vietnam's export-related NTMs, technical measures seem to be effective in increasing Vietnam's exports of final products to importing countries with a level of per capita income below US$11,462. For those importing country markets, the positive marginal effect of Vietnam's export-related technical measures on exports of final products is higher in poorer countries. On the other hand, the non-technical categories tend to negatively affect Vietnamese exports of intermediate goods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We thank Kiyotaka Sato, Nagendra Shrestha, Minako Fujio, and Teru Nishikawa for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this work.

The outcomes revealed that “perceived vaccine efficacy” and “xenophobia” were two significant predictors of “attitude toward inbound tourism.” Implications of this study were then discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Inbound Tourism Reopening; Vaccine Efficacy; Vietnam; Xenophobia","","","","","S Abdool Karim, Salim Safurdeen S., Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant: a new chapter in the COVID-19 pandemic, The Lancet, 398, 10317, pp. 2126-2128, (2021); Alam, Md Samsul, The impact of tourism on income inequality in developing economies: Does Kuznets curve hypothesis exist?, Annals of Tourism Research, 61, pp. 111-126, (2016); Top Sites in Vietnam, (2021); Barbarino, Maria Luisa, Different Origins of Xenophile and Xenophobic Orientations in Human Personality Structure: A Theoretical Perspective and Some Preliminary Findings, Journal of Social Issues, 72, 3, pp. 432-449, (2016); Bean, Sandra J., Vaccine perceptions among oregon health care providers, Qualitative Health Research, 23, 9, pp. 1251-1266, (2013); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Breckler, Steven J., Empirical validation of affect, behavior, and cognition as distinct components of attitude, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 47, 6, pp. 1191-1205, (1984); Multiple Linear Regression Viewpoints, (2012); Carr, Anna M., COVID-19, indigenous peoples and tourism: a view from New Zealand, Tourism Geographies, 22, 3, pp. 491-502, (2020); Castéran, Herbert, Does authenticity really affect behavior?

Sri Lanka, in particular, faces serious difficulties in finding new sites for MSW disposal, due to the lack of available space; therefore, the rehabilitation of existing MSW dumping sites and the extension of their services are required to achieve sustainable urban development. To examine suitable rehabilitation techniques, it is essential to identify the physicochemical and mechanical properties of dumped MSW, fully considering climatic conditions, waste composition, and the time since the waste was dumped. In this study, therefore, the physicochemical and mechanical properties of dumped MSW were investigated; the dumped MSW was taken from existing MSW dumping sites in three climate zones in Sri Lanka, namely the Karadiyana site in the wet zone, Udapalatha in the intermediate zone, and Hambantota in the dry zone, and it was taken at different times after being dumped. The results showed that the waste composition and biodegradation of organic materials affected the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the dumped waste. The measured compaction parameters of the “old” sites at Udapalatha and Hambantota were higher compared to the “new” sites. Compaction parameters at the Karadiyana site, on the other hand, were low, at even >20 years since being dumped, probably due to the high amount of scarcely compacted materials. In direct shear tests, both strain hardening and softening of the waste samples were observed, depending on the difference in vertical stress. Based on the Pearson correlations among measured physicochemical and mechanical parameters, it was found that the loss on ignition (LOI) would be a good indicator to quickly assess the mechanical parameters of “new” and “old” waste materials, due to the small sensitivities to waste age and climate conditions in Sri Lanka. In particular, LOI correlated well to measured specific gravity and compaction properties, and the r2 values of correlations exceeded |0.80|. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compaction; Municipal Solid Waste (msw); Open Dumping; Shear Strength; Waste Age; Waste Composition; Biodegradation; Climate Conditions; Compaction; Municipal Solid Waste; Physicochemical Property; Waste Management; Sri Lanka","biodegradation; climate conditions; compaction; municipal solid waste; physicochemical property; waste management; Sri Lanka","","","This research was supported by the JST?JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for the Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Fernando, Rangika Lalitha S., Solid waste management of local governments in the Western Province of Sri Lanka: An implementation analysis, Waste Management, 84, pp. 194-203, (2019); Falamaki, Amin, Laboratory Simulation of Aeration on Municipal Solid Waste from Barmshoor Landfill, International Journal of Civil Engineering, 17, 6, pp. 897-906, (2019); Sustainable Urbanization Strategy Undps Support to Sustainable Inclusive and Resilient Cities in the Developing World, (2016); Proceedings of the International Symposium on Advances in Civil and Environmental Engineering Practices for Sustainable Development Aceps, (2025); Iqbal, Muhammad Rashid, Geotechnical properties of sludge blended with crushed concrete and incineration ash, International Journal of GEOMATE, 16, 57, pp. 116-123, (2019); Asadi, Mohsen, Validation of Hyperbolic Model by the Results of Triaxial and Direct Shear Tests of Municipal Solid Waste, Geotechnical and Geological Engineering, 35, 5, pp. 2003-2015, (2017); Zhao, Yanru, A study of shear strength properties of municipal solid waste in Chongqing landfill, China, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 21, 22, pp. 12605-12615, (2014); Advances in Environmental Geotechnics, (2025); Singh, Manoj Kumar, Shear strength testing of intact and recompacted samples of municipal solid waste, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 46, 10, pp. 1133-1145, (2009); Zhan, Liangtong, Shear strength characterization of municipal solid waste at the Suzhou landfill, China, Engineering Geology, 97, 3-4, pp. 97-111, (2008)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129138594"

In this study, a series of compaction, California bearing ratio, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and particle breakage tests of well– and poor–graded mixtures of recycled clay brick aggregates (RCBs) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) with maximum aggregate diameters of 19, 25, and 37.5 mm were carried out to examine the practical application of those mixtures to unbound roadbed materials in Vietnam. The experimental results suggest that the maximum amount of RCBs added to RCAs should be less than 30% when applied to unbound roadbed materials. In addition, it was found that the mixing proportions of RCBs and RCAs and the maximum aggregate diameter, gradation of aggregates, and initial moisture condition control the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Further, the particle breakage characteristics under compaction were carefully examined, and it was found that the percentage increment/decrement, as well as a newly introduced method of estimating the mixing proportions of RCAs and RCBs in the fine fraction (<2.36 mm), is effective in understanding the mechanism of particle breakage of RCA and RCB mixtures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","California Bearing Ratio (cbr); Compaction; Hydraulic Conductivity; Particle Breakage; Recycled Clay Brick Aggregate; Recycled Concrete Aggregate; Road Base And Subbase; Aggregate; Breakage; Concrete; Hydraulic Conductivity; Road Construction; Viet Nam","aggregate; breakage; concrete; hydraulic conductivity; road construction; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the JST?JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was supported by the JST–JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 3: Acknowledgments: This research was supported by JST-JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (No. JPMJSA1701).","Pratap, Vinay, Solid Waste Treatment: Technological Advancements and Challenges, pp. 215-231, (2021); Nguyen, Hoang Giang, Current management condition and waste composition characteristics of construction and demolition waste landfills in hanoi of vietnam, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 18, (2021); Singh, Pradeep Pratap, Solid waste management through the concept of zero waste, pp. 293-318, (2021); Nguyen, Van Dinh, Current status of construction and demolition waste management in Vietnam: Challenges and opportunities, International Journal of GEOMATE, 15, 52, pp. 23-29, (2018); Yazdani, M., Improving construction and demolition waste collection service in an urban area using a simheuristic approach: A case study in Sydney, Australia, Journal of Cleaner Production, 280, (2021); Asif, Muhammad, Life cycle assessment: A case study of a dwelling home in Scotland, Building and Environment, 42, 3, pp. 1391-1394, (2007); Agamuthu, Pariatamby, Challenges in sustainable management of construction and demolition waste, Waste Management and Research, 26, 6, pp. 491-492, (2008); Hoang, Ngoc Han, A review of construction and demolition waste management in Southeast Asia, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 22, 2, pp. 315-325, (2020); Norouzi, Masoud, Circular economy in the building and construction sector: A scientific evolution analysis, Journal of Building Engineering, 44, (2021); Lieder, Michael, Towards circular economy implementation: A comprehensive review in context of manufacturing industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 115, pp. 36-51, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129132418"

We used a legal doctrine method to review the updated Vietnamese legal frameworks, consisting of substantive, procedural, and preventive cybercrime law. We then combined the analysis of four cybercrime cases and in-depth interviews of seven senior police officials to analyse the application of cybercrime law. The main findings reveal that by updating its legal system, Vietnam has shown a determination to prevent and disrupt cybercrime. Despite positive results, Vietnam’s fight against cybercrime still faces legal challenges, including traditional and novel ones. Moreover, active and flexible approaches within Vietnam’s cyberspace management can increase the effectiveness of combating cybercriminal activities; however, they can cause concerns in balancing cybercrime control and human rights protection. These approaches could then constitute a useful case study for other similar situations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We would like to thank Prof. Ken Miichi (Waseda University) for his advice and his comments on earlier versions of the article.","World Internet Usage and Population Statistics, (2012); E Conomy Sea 2018, (2018); Economic Impact of Cybercrime, (2018); van Nguyen, Trong, Cybercrime in Vietnam: An analysis based on routine activity theory, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 14, 1, pp. 156-173, (2020); Bao Cao Tong Ket Nam 2010, (2010); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2014); van Nguyen, Trong, The structure of cybercrime networks: transnational computer fraud in Vietnam, Journal of Crime and Justice, 44, 4, pp. 419-440, (2021); van Nguyen, Trong, The modus operandi of transnational computer fraud: a crime script analysis in Vietnam, Trends in Organized Crime, 25, 2, pp. 226-247, (2022); Great Cyber Game in South China Sea, (2016)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15730751; 09254994","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114691103"

However, the development and operation of infrastructure such as dikes and sluice gates in NRs, as seen in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), often adversely affects the hydrological regime and water quality at both local and regional scales. This study analyzes the consequences of a constructed dike system on the hydrological regime and water quality in the NRs through an integrated approach including hydrochemical analysis (using descriptive statistics and weighted arithmetic water quality index (WAWQI) analysis), traditional interviews (face to face), using semi-structured questionnaires, field surveys, and secondary data. Results show that constructed infrastructure has helped maintain water supplies for both livelihoods and forest fire prevention. However, considerable impacts on the hydrological regime and water quality have occurred. From water quality assessments in three NRs, 29% of sampling sites in the My Phuoc melaleuca forest (MPMF) had WAWQI values over 100, while all sites in Lung Ngoc Hoang NR (LNHNR) and Mua Xuan Agriculture Center (MXAC) had WAWQI values over 100. This was to a large extent due to elevated concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD<inf>5</inf>), and phosphate (PO<inf>4</inf>3−). Meanwhile, during the wet season, pollution was marginally reduced by dilution, with 42.86% of sites at Lung Ngoc Hoang NR, 28.57% of sites at MXAC, and 78.57% of sites at MPMF having WAWQI values of less than 100. These results show the issue of water pollution at spatio-temporal scales, and call for better holistic management options for improving the hydrological regime and water quality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lung Ngoc Hoang Nature Reserve; Mua Xuan Agriculture Center; My Phuoc Melaleuca Forest; Water Pollution; Wawqi","","","","","1st Environment Asia International Conference on Environmental Supporting in Food and Energy Security Crisis and Opportunity, (2011); Minh, Huynh Vuong Thu, Impact of rice intensification and urbanization on surface water quality in an giang using a statistical approach, Water (Switzerland), 12, 6, (2020); Minh, Huynh Vuong Thu, Effects of multi-dike protection systems on surface water quality in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Water (Switzerland), 11, 5, (2019); Managerial Status of Protected Areas in Viet Nam; Assessment of the Farming Models in the Lung Ngoc Hoang Nature Reserve in Hau Giang Province; Water and Sewage Works, (1970); American Journal of Water Resources, (2013); Dunnette, David A., A geographically variable water quality index used in Oregon, Journal of the Water Pollution Control Federation, 51, 1, pp. 53-61, (1979); Dinius, Sara H., DESIGN OF AN INDEX OF WATER QUALITY, Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 23, 5, pp. 833-843, (1987); Kumar, Dinesh, NSF-water quality index: Does it represent the experts' opinion?, Practice Periodical of Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste Management, 13, 1, pp. 75-79, (2009)","","MDPI","","","","","","24138851","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150654809"

The optimization of the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of biological settling ponds plays a crucial role in establishing the stability of outflow wastewater quality and suitability of the settling pond area (SPA). This study aims to suggest appropriate HRT and SPA for super-intensive shrimp wastewater treatment systems based on the National Standard (QCVN 02-19:2014/BNNPTNT) and the best aquaculture practices (BAP) standards and guidelines. We investigated 20 typical super-intensive shrimp farms in the VMD and collected effluent samples from siphoning process, daily water exchange, and outflow of biological effluent-treatment settling ponds. The results showed that the average of each super-intensive shrimp farm produced wastewater at approximately 218 m3 ha−1 day−1. The contaminant loads of TSS, COD, TKN, and TP were commensurate to 177, 113, 9.86, and 4.19 kg ha−1 day−1, respectively. Based on the relationship between outflow COD, TSS concentrations, and HRT of biological-surveyed settling ponds, a 13.4-day HRT and 1934-m2 SPA were suggested to optimize the super-intensive shrimp wastewater treatment systems. Our recommendation for further work is to continuously optimize the HRT and SPA rates of functional ponds (anaerobic, facultative, and maturation) to ameliorate the engineering configuration of the recommended biological settling pond. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological Settling Ponds; Hydraulic Retention Time; Settling Pond Area; Shrimp Wastewater Treatment; Super-intensive Shrimp Farming; Aquaculture; Biological Water Treatment; Effluent Treatment; Effluents; Ponds; Reclamation; Wastewater Treatment; Biological Settling Pond; Hydraulic Retention; Hydraulic Retention Time; Retention Time; Settling Pond Area; Settling Ponds; Shrimp Farming; Shrimp Wastewater Treatment; Super-intensive Shrimp Farming; Lakes; Effluent; Optimization; Pond; Waste Treatment; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality","Aquaculture; Biological water treatment; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Ponds; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Biological settling pond; Hydraulic retention; Hydraulic retention time; Retention time; Settling pond area; Settling ponds; Shrimp farming; Shrimp wastewater treatment; Super-intensive shrimp farming; Lakes; effluent; optimization; pond; waste treatment; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water quality","","","Funding: This study was funded by WWF Viet Nam.","Nguyen, Tram Anh Thi, Is super-intensification the solution to shrimp production and export sustainability?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 19, (2019); Boyd, Claude Elson, Perspectives on the mangrove conundrum, land use, and benefits of yield intensification in farmed shrimp production: A review, Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 53, 1, pp. 8-46, (2022); undefined, (2020); Phuong Lan, Ngo Thi Phuong, Social and ecological challenges of market-oriented shrimp farming in Vietnam, SpringerPlus, 2, 1, pp. 1-10, (2013); Report on Assessment and Recommendation of Appropriate Solutions to Treat Wastewater from Super Intensive Shrimp Farms in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, (2020); Khoa, Tran Nguyen Duy, Super-intensive culture of white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in outdoor biofloc systems with different sunlight exposure levels: Emphasis on commercial applications, Aquaculture, 524, (2020); Shi, Yonghai, Performance of a constructed wetland in treating brackish wastewater from commercial recirculating and super-intensive shrimp growout systems, Bioresource Technology, 102, 20, pp. 9416-9424, (2011); Dauda, Akeem Babatunde, Biofloc technology: a review on the microbial interactions, operational parameters and implications to disease and health management of cultured aquatic animals, Reviews in Aquaculture, 12, 2, pp. 1193-1210, (2020); Lin, Yingfeng, Performance of a constructed wetland treating intensive shrimp aquaculture wastewater under high hydraulic loading rate, Environmental Pollution, 134, 3, pp. 411-421, (2005); International Journal of Environment Agriculture and Biotechnology, (2025)","","MDPI","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127368698"

Most of these conversions included expansions of coffee plantations in Dak Lak and Lam Dong provinces, which are in the world’s Robusta coffee production area. The aim of this study is to quantify the impact on the water cycle due to the conversion of forest to coffee plantations in a tropical humid climate region by the application of a hydrological model: soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The model was calibrated with climate data from 1980–1994, validated with climate data from 1995–2010, and verified with statistical indicators such as Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error (RSR). The simulations indicated that forest conversions into agriculture (expansion of coffee plantations) had significantly increased surface runoff (SUR) while actual evapotranspiration (ET), soil water content (SW), and groundwater discharge (GW) decreased. These changes are mainly related to the decrease in infiltration and leaf area index (LAI) post land cover changes. However, the soil was not thoroughly destroyed after deforestation due to the replacement of the lost forest with crops and vegetation. Therefore, changes in infiltration were marginal and not sufficient to bring large changes in the annual flow. Higher reductions in ET and SW were proposed, resulting in reduced streamflow in the dry season at the basin where the proportion of agricultural land was higher than the forest cover. Besides the plantation expansion, which resulted in streamflow reductions in the dry season, an existing problem was over‐irrigation of coffee plantations that could likely deplete groundwater resources. Hence, balancing economic benefits by coffee production and mitigating groundwater depletion issues should be prioritized for land use management in the study area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coffee Plantation; Dong Nai River Basin; Flow Regime; Lucc; Swat; Climate Models; Deforestation; Drought; Economics; Expansion; Groundwater; Groundwater Resources; Infiltration; Land Use; Soil Moisture; Stream Flow; Agricultural Land; Climate Data; Coffee Plantation; Dong Nai River Basin; Flow Regimes; Forest Conversion; Lucc; River Basins; Soil And Water Assessment Tools; Viet Nam; Watersheds; Agricultural Land; Deforestation; Dry Season; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Hydrological Cycle; Hydrological Regime; Infiltration; Land Cover; Land Use; Leaf Area Index; River Basin; Dak Lak; Lam Dong","Climate models; Deforestation; Drought; Economics; Expansion; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Infiltration; Land use; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Agricultural land; Climate data; Coffee plantation; Dong nai river basin; Flow regimes; Forest conversion; LUCC; River basins; Soil and Water assessment tools; Viet Nam; Watersheds; agricultural land; deforestation; dry season; evapotranspiration; groundwater; hydrological cycle; hydrological regime; infiltration; land cover; land use; leaf area index; river basin; Dak Lak; Lam Dong","","","We would like to thank the Center for Environmental Remote Sensing, Chiba University for supporting me as a cooperative researcher.","Context of Redd in Vietnam Drivers Agents and Institutions, (2012); Truong, Nguyen Cung Que, Land use and land cover changes and their effect on the flow regime in the upstream Dong Nai River Basin, Vietnam, Water (Switzerland), 10, 9, (2018); Arnold, Jeffrey G., SWAT: Model use, calibration, and validation, Transactions of the ASABE, 55, 4, pp. 1491-1508, (2012); International Symposium on Forest Hydrology, (1967); Bosch, J.

Particularly, nursing students experience greater stress as their normal curriculum is interrupted and some of them face the risk of being infected as frontline workers. Nursing faculty members may face similar struggles, in addition to developing teaching materials for online learning. Thus, it is important to examine the faculty members' and students' views on their ability to adapt during the pandemic to obtain a holistic view of how learning and training has been affected. Design: The descriptive cross-sectional quantitative design was used. Settings: Data were collected from Southeast and East Asian Nursing Education and Research Network (SEANERN) affiliated nursing institutions from January 2021 to August 2021. Participants: A total of 1897 nursing students and 395 faculty members from SEANERN-affiliated nursing institutions in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam were recruited for this study. Methods: Quantitative surveys were used to explore the satisfaction levels in education modalities, confidence levels, psychosocial well-being, sense of coherence and stress levels of nursing students and faculty members during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Participants were mostly satisfied with the new education modalities, although most students felt that their education was compromised. Both groups showed positive levels of psychosocial well-being, despite scoring low to medium on the sense of coherence scale and experiencing great stress. The participants' sense of coherence was positively correlated with their psychosocial well-being and negatively correlated with stress levels. Conclusions: While the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted the lives of nursing students and faculty members, most of them had a healthy level of psychosocial well-being. Having a strong sense of coherence was associated with better psychosocial health and lower stress levels. As such, it may be helpful to develop interventions aimed at improving the sense of coherence of nursing students and staff to help them manage stressors better. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Education; Nursing Undergraduates; Pandemic; Salutogenesis; Sense Of Coherence; Cross-sectional Study; Epidemiology; Human; Nursing Education; Nursing Student; Pandemic; Psychology; Sense Of Coherence; University; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Education, Nursing; Faculty, Nursing; Humans; Pandemics; Sense Of Coherence; Students, Nursing; Universities","cross-sectional study; epidemiology; human; nursing education; nursing student; pandemic; psychology; sense of coherence; university; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing; Faculty, Nursing; Humans; Pandemics; Sense of Coherence; Students, Nursing; Universities","","","This research was funded by the South East and East Asian Nursing Education and Research Network and supported by the China Medical Board .","Health Stress and Coping, (1979); Antonovsky, Aaron, The structure and properties of the sense of coherence scale, Social Science and Medicine, 36, 6, pp. 725-733, (1993); Aslan, Hakime, Nursing students' views on the COVID-19 pandemic and their percieved stress levels, Perspectives in Psychiatric Care, 57, 2, pp. 695-701, (2021); Cardeña, Etzel, Psychometric properties of the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ): A valid and reliable measure of acute stress, Journal of Traumatic Stress, 13, 4, pp. 719-734, (2000); Dewart, Georgia K., Nursing education in a pandemic: Academic challenges in response to COVID-19, Nurse Education Today, 92, (2020); Du, Shizheng, The knowledge, ability, and skills of primary health care providers in SEANERN countries: A multi-national cross-sectional study, BMC Health Services Research, 19, 1, (2019); Impact of Covid 19 on Education and on the Well Being of Teachers Parents and Students Challenges Related to Remote Online Learning and Opportunities for Advancing the Quality of Education, (2020); Efendi, Ferry, Nursing qualification and workforce for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community, Nursing Forum, 53, 2, pp. 197-203, (2018); Eriksson, Monica, Validity of Antonovsky's sense of coherence scale: A systematic review, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 59, 6, pp. 460-466, (2005); Eriksson, Monica, The level of sense of coherence among Swedish nursing staff, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 75, 11, pp. 2766-2772, (2019)","","Churchill Livingstone","","","","","","02606917; 15322793","","","35101809","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123587637"

The study is based on survey data from a group of international (non-Japanese) students in Japan and the theoretical foundation of fear appeal theory. The results, which are based on the panel data structure, show that individually, (1) the act of seeking out others to discuss risks in depth in the current pandemic context or (2) the observed adoption of advocated precautionary health behaviours is not necessarily a good indicator of mental management, but (3) the combined effect of (1) and (2) unexpectedly suggests a conciliatory effect on the fear of disasters. Moreover, this evidence-based finding (3) suggests that a reciprocal relationship exists between threat and efficacy in terms of mediating fear under the framework and theory of fear appeals, indirectly challenging the fear control response proposition of the extended parallel process model. Our empirical findings emphasize the role of risk discourse and information sharing combined with preventive health behaviours adopted within a community in the context of global health crises. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Extended Parallel Process Model; Fear Appeals Theory; Fear Of Disasters; Foreign Students In Japan; Risk Communication Networks","","","","","Lewnard, Joseph A., Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in California and Washington: Prospective cohort study, BMJ, 369, 9, (2020); Covid 19 Strategy Update, (2020); Trevors, Gregory J., Correcting COVID-19 Misconceptions Requires Caution, Educational Researcher, 49, 7, pp. 538-542, (2020); Chen, Qiang, Unpacking the black box: How to promote citizen engagement through government social media during the COVID-19 crisis, Computers in Human Behavior, 110, (2020); Clark, Cory J., Predictors of COVID-19 voluntary compliance behaviors: An international investigation, Global Transitions, 2, pp. 76-82, (2020); Shaw, Rajib K., Governance, technology and citizen behavior in pandemic: Lessons from COVID-19 in East Asia, Progress in Disaster Science, 6, (2020); Reynolds, Barbara J., Crisis and emergency risk communication as an integrative model, Journal of Health Communication, 10, 1, pp. 43-55, (2005); Lee, Minjung, Psychological and behavioral responses in South Korea during the early stages of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 9, (2020); Communication Yearbook, (1995); Gómez, Oscar A., Lessons from international students’ reaction to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake: The case of the school of engineering at Tohoku University, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 4, 3, pp. 137-149, (2013)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22124209","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123284189"

Using data from the Young Lives project for Vietnam, we examine the effects of exposure to historically abnormal rainfall among children in utero on the cognitive development of the same children from 5 to 15 years of age. Based on data on month and place of birth, we show that positive rainfall shocks are associated with better cognitive development in children up to 8 years of age. The effect is more pronounced when positive shocks occur in the early stage of gestation. However, such positive effects are not sustained: the impacts of positive rainfall shocks on cognition are completely absent at 10 and 15 years of age.

Consequently, many countries have adopted restrictive measures that caused a substantial change in society. Within this framework, it is reasonable to suppose that a sentiment of societal discontent, defined as generalized concern about the precarious state of society, has arisen. Literature shows that collectively experienced situations can motivate people to help each other. Since societal discontent is conceptualized as a collective phenomenon, we argue that it could influence intention to help others, particularly those who suffer from coronavirus. Thus, in the present study, we aimed (a) to explore the relationship between societal discontent and intention to help at the individual level and (b) to investigate a possible moderating effect of societal discontent at the country level on this relationship. To fulfil our purposes, we used data collected in 42 countries (N = 61,734) from the PsyCorona Survey, a cross-national longitudinal study. Results of multilevel analysis showed that, when societal discontent is experienced by the entire community, individuals dissatisfied with society are more prone to help others. Testing the model with longitudinal data (N = 3,817) confirmed our results. Implications for those findings are discussed in relation to crisis management.

The arguments presented are mainly drawn from (i) up-to-date publications that report on the recent SI intensification in the VMD and (ii) the power spectral analysis results using water level data. We verified the intensifying SI in the VMD both in its frequency and magnitude and remarked on four of the key SI drivers: (i) upstream hydropower dams, (ii) land subsidence, (iii) the relative sea-level rise, and (iv) riverbed sand mining. Also, a non-exhaustive yet list of recommendable management implications to mitigate the negative effects of the SI is contributed. The mitigation measures must be realized at multiple scales, ranging from pursuing transboundary water diplomacy efforts to managing internal pressures via developing early warnings, restricting illegal sand mining activities, alleviating pressures on groundwater resources, and diversifying agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mekong Delta; Riverbed Incision; Salinity Intrusion; Sea-level Rise; Upstream Dams; Disaster Management; Environmental Impact; Groundwater Resource; Management Practice; Saline Intrusion; Spectral Analysis; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Ground Water; Salt Water; Agriculture; Disaster; Salinity; Agriculture; Disasters; Groundwater; Saline Waters; Salinity","disaster management; environmental impact; groundwater resource; management practice; saline intrusion; spectral analysis; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; ground water; salt water; agriculture; disaster; salinity; Agriculture; Disasters; Groundwater; Saline Waters; Salinity","","","This research is funded by SUG-NAP (3/19) of the National Institute of Education at Nanyang Technological University, AcRF Tier1 RT 06/19 of the Ministry of Education (MoE) of Singapore, Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), and the Supporting Program for Interaction-Based Initiative Team Studies SPIRITS 2016 of Kyoto University.","Apel, Heiko, Brief communication: Seasonal prediction of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 20, 6, pp. 1609-1616, (2020); Arias, Mauricio E., Maintaining perspective of ongoing environmental change in the Mekong floodplains, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 37, pp. 1-7, (2019); Binh, Doan Van, Changes to long-term discharge and sediment loads in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta caused by upstream dams, Geomorphology, 353, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, Long-term alterations of flow regimes of the Mekong River and adaptation strategies for the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 32, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, A novel method for river bank detection from landsat satellite data: A case study in the Vietnamese Mekong delta, Remote Sensing, 12, 20, pp. 1-20, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, Riverbed incision in the Vietnamese mekong delta due to altered flow regime and sediment load, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, Effects of riverbed incision on the hydrology of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Hydrological Processes, 35, 2, (2021); Echogeo, (2013); Brunier, Guillaume, Recent morphological changes in the Mekong and Bassac river channels, Mekong delta: The marked impact of river-bed mining and implications for delta destabilisation, Geomorphology, 224, pp. 177-191, (2014); Rapid Assessment of the Extent and Impact of Sea Level Rise in Viet Nam, (2008)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","16547209; 00447447","","AMBOC","34115345","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107807283"

Inequalities have been greatly reduced in areas such as education or employment. Because inequalities lead to distress, this development has largely benefited women. One notable exception is the realm of parenting, which has remained rife with inequalities even in the most egalitarian countries. We hypothesized that experiencing inequality in parenting when one holds egalitarian values and raising a child in a country characterized by a high level of gender equality in other areas, increases mothers’ psychological distress in the specific area of parenting. Multilevel modeling analyses computed among 11,538 mothers from 40 countries confirmed this prediction: high egalitarian values at the individual level and high gender equality at the societal level are associated with higher burnout levels in mothers. The associations hold beyond differences in sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level and beyond economic disparities at the societal level. These findings show the importance of egalitarian values and gender equality and their paradoxical effect when inequalities are still present in specific areas as parenting. This study reveals the crucial need to act not only at the micro level but also at the macro level to promote gender equality in parenting and prevent parental burnout. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Egalitarian Values; Family Policies; Gender Equality Paradox; Parental Burnout","","","","","Amato, Paul R., Continuity and change in marital quality between 1980 and 2000, Journal of Marriage and Family, 65, 1, pp. 1-22, (2003); Eryılmaz, Günce Sabah, Validation of the Turkish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 15-32, (2020); Bianchi, Suzanne M., Housework: Who did, does or will do it, and how much does it matter?, Social Forces, 91, 1, pp. 55-63, (2012); Brycz, Hanna, Cross-cultural differences in metacognitive self, Economics and Sociology, 8, 1, pp. 157-164, (2015); Theory of Fertility Decline, (1982); La Gobernabilidad En America Latina Balance Reciente Y Tendencias A Futuro, (2005); Egypt Statistics, (2021); Chen, Ying, Positive parenting improves multiple aspects of health and well-being in young adulthood, Nature Human Behaviour, 3, 7, pp. 684-691, (2019); Cheung, Gordon Wai Hung, Evaluating goodness-of-fit indexes for testing measurement invariance, Structural Equation Modeling, 9, 2, pp. 233-255, (2002); Coltrane, Scott E., Research on household labor: Modeling and measuring the social embeddedness of routine family work, Journal of Marriage and Family, 62, 4, pp. 1208-1233, (2000)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","00220221; 15525422","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125801434"

Results indicate that sorting accounts for around 8 percent of the test-score variance, similar in magnitude to the contribution of differences in school quality.

To evaluate the heat balance in paved surfaces and to select appropriate road construction materials that help suppress heat islands, an accurate understanding of heat transport parameters such as thermal conductivity (λ) and heat capacity (HC) is important. Recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste, including scrap construction materials and industrial by-products, are often used for road construction; however, λ and HC of recycled aggregates especially for roadbeds are not fully un-derstood. This study involved a series of laboratory tests to measure λ and HC of recycled concrete and clay brick aggregates (<40 mm) and their mixtures with autoclaved aerated concrete grains (<2 mm) under varied moisture conditions. The measured λ and HC increased with increasing volu-metric water content (θ). Closed-form models for estimating λ(θ) were proposed using normalized thermal conductivity (λe) and effective saturation (Se). The new λe(Se) models performed well for the measured data compared to previously proposed models and would be useful to evaluate λ of recycled aggregates for roadbed materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (aac); Construction And Demolition Waste (cdw); Heat Capacity; Recycled Aggregates; Thermal Conductivity; Urban Heat Islands; Aggregate; Concrete; Demolition; Measurement Method; Numerical Model; Recycling; Road Construction; Thermal Conductivity","aggregate; concrete; demolition; measurement method; numerical model; recycling; road construction; thermal conductivity","","","Funding: This research was supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science, and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

(2) Methods: Surveys were distributed to 578 participants in selected international companies in Turkey, Taiwan, Japan, and China. To reduce uncertainty and errors, the surveys were rigorously evaluated and did not show a normal distribution, as it was determined that 85 participants did not consciously fill out the questionnaires, and the questionnaires from the remaining 493 participants were used. By using the evaluation model of employee satisfaction based on a back propagation (BP) neural network, we explored the manifestation and impact of abusive management and self-efficacy. Using the listed real estate businesses as an example, we proposed a deep learning BP neural network-based employee job satisfaction evaluation model and a human–machine technology-based employee performance evaluation system under situational perception, according to the design requirements of human– machine interaction. (3) Results: The results show that the human–machine interface can log in according to the correct verbal instructions of the employees. In terms of age and education level variables, employees’ perceptions of leaders’ abusive management and self-efficacy are significantly different from their job performances, respectively (p < 0.01). (4) Conclusions: artificial intelligence (AI)-based human–machine interaction technology, malicious management, and self-efficacy directly affect enterprise performance and employee satisfaction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abusive Management; Artificial Intelligence; Bp Neural Network; Enterprise Performance; Ergonomics; Human– Machine Interface Performance; Human–machine Interaction Technology; Sustainable Development Management; Artificial Intelligence; Back Propagation; Education; Exploration; Machinery; Management Practice; Organizational Framework; China; Japan; Taiwan; Turkey","artificial intelligence; back propagation; education; exploration; machinery; management practice; organizational framework; China; Japan; Taiwan; Turkey","","","","Int J Sci Eng Res, (2017); Wilson, John R., Fundamentals of systems ergonomics/human factors, Applied Ergonomics, 45, 1, pp. 5-13, (2014); Thatcher, Andrew, Human factors for a sustainable future, Applied Ergonomics, 57, pp. 1-7, (2016); Ofis Ergonomisi Srt Ve Boyun Arlarn Onlemek Cin Ofis Ortamn Duzenlemek, (2002); Ergonomi Ve Calsanlarn Verimlilii Uzerine Etkileri, (2008); Gazi Universitesi Fen Bilimleri Dergisi, (2015); Kosti, Makrina Viola, Towards an affordable brain computer interface for the assessment of programmers’ mental workload, International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 115, pp. 52-66, (2018); undefined; Muhammad, Noor, The relationship between environmental performance and financial performance in periods of growth and contraction: Evidence from Australian publicly listed companies, Journal of Cleaner Production, 102, pp. 324-332, (2015); Jarrahi, Mohammad Hossein, Artificial intelligence and the future of work: Human-AI symbiosis in organizational decision making, Business Horizons, 61, 4, pp. 577-586, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124566697"

Calibrated for the year of 2019 and validated for the year of 2020, the developed model showed a significant agreement between the observed and simulated values of water quality parameters. Locations near to cage culture areas exhibited higher BOD<inf>5</inf> values than sites close to pond/lagoon culture areas due to the effects of numerous point sources of pollution, including upstream wastewater and out-fluxes from residential and tourism activities in the surrounding areas, all of which had a direct impact on the quality of the surface water used for aquaculture. Moreover, as aquacultural effluents have intensified and dispersed over time, water quality in the surrounding water bodies has degraded. The findings suggest that the effective planning, assessment and management of rapidly expanding aquaculture sites should be improved, including more rigorous water quality monitoring, to ensure the long-term sustainable expansion and development of the aquacultural sector in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle in particular, and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta as a whole. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cage Culture; Ecolab Module; Hydrodynamics Modeling; One Dimension; Pond/lagoon Culture; Surface Water Quality; Aquaculture; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Dissolved Oxygen; Effluents; Quality Management; Water Conservation; Water Management; Water Quality; Cage Culture; Ecolab Module; Hydrodynamic Modeling; Mekong Delta; Model Based Approach; One Dimension; Pond/lagoon Culture; Surface Water Quality; Vietnamese; Water Quality Parameters; Lakes; Aquaculture; Cage Culture; Calibration; Parameter Estimation; Point Source Pollution; Surface Water; Water Quality; Viet Nam","Aquaculture; Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolved oxygen; Effluents; Quality management; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Cage culture; Ecolab module; Hydrodynamic modeling; Mekong Delta; Model based approach; One dimension; Pond/lagoon culture; Surface water quality; Vietnamese; Water quality parameters; Lakes; aquaculture; cage culture; calibration; parameter estimation; point source pollution; surface water; water quality; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This study is funded in part by the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14-P6, supported by a Japanese ODA loan.","Duc, Nguyenhong, Scenario-based numerical simulation to predict future water quality for developing robust water management plan: a case study from the Hau River, Vietnam, Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 26, 7, (2021); Minh, Huynh Vuong Thu, Impact of rice intensification and urbanization on surface water quality in an giang using a statistical approach, Water (Switzerland), 12, 6, (2020); Minh, Huynh Vuong Thu, Effects of multi-dike protection systems on surface water quality in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Water (Switzerland), 11, 5, (2019); Vörösmarty, Charles J., Global threats to human water security and river biodiversity, Nature, 467, 7315, pp. 555-561, (2010); Chua Thia-Eng, The environmental impact of aquaculture and the effects of pollution on coastal aquaculture development in Southeast Asia, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 20, 7, pp. 335-343, (1989); Schneider, Pia, Rice production and food security in Asian Mega deltas—A review on characteristics, vulnerabilities and agricultural adaptation options to cope with climate change, Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science, 206, 4, pp. 491-503, (2020); Berg, Håkan, Use of pesticides and attitude to pest management strategies among rice and rice-fish farmers in the mekong delta, Vietnam, International Journal of Pest Management, 58, 2, pp. 153-164, (2012); Anh, Pham Thi, Water pollution by Pangasius production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam: Causes and options for control, Aquaculture Research, 42, 1, pp. 108-128, (2010); Mutea, Fridah Gacheri, Assessment of water quality for aquaculture in hau river, mekong delta, Vietnam using multivariate statistical analysis, Water (Switzerland), 13, 22, (2021); Bouman, Bas A.M., Field water management to save water and increase its productivity in irrigated lowland rice, Agricultural Water Management, 49, 1, pp. 11-30, (2001)","","MDPI","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123697877"

However, their existing operational laws usually generate unreasonable computing results, especially when the agreement degree (AD) or neutrality degree (ND) or opposition degree (OD) is zero. To tackle this issue, we propose the interactional operational laws (IOLs) to compute picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs), which can capture the interaction between the ADs and NDs in two PFNs, as well as the interaction between the ADs and ODs in two PFNs. Based on the proposed novel IOLs, partitioned Heronian mean (PHM) operator, and partitioned geometric Heronian mean (PGHM) operator, some picture fuzzy interactional PHM (PFIPHM), weighted PFIPHM (PFIWPHM), geometric PFIPHM (PFIPGHM), and weighted PFIPGHM (PFIWPGHM) operators are proposed in this paper. Afterwards, we investigate the properties of these operators. Using the PFIWPHM and PFIWPGHM operators, a novel multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) method with PFNs is elaborated. Finally, a study example that involves the service quality ranking of nursing facilities is provided to show the decision procedure of the proposed MADM method and we also give the comparative analysis between the proposed operators and the existing aggregation operators developed for PFNs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aggregation Operator; Madm; Mcdm; Partitioned Heronian Mean; Picture Fuzzy Set; Decision Making; Fuzzy Sets; Aggregation Operator; Comparative Analysis; Decision Procedure; Heronian Means; Information Loss; Multiple Attribute Decision Making; Operational Laws; Service Quality; Mathematical Operators","Decision making; Fuzzy sets; Aggregation operator; Comparative analysis; Decision procedure; Heronian means; Information loss; Multiple attribute decision making; Operational laws; Service Quality; Mathematical operators","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61872086, 61972093 and U1805263, and Digital Fujian Institute of Big Data for Agriculture and Forestry under Grant No. KJG18019A.","Atanassov, Krassimir T., Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 20, 1, pp. 87-96, (1986); Beliakov, G.

VEP and VFP are examined under two decompositions, idiosyncratic vulnerability and covariate vulnerability, by constructing a multilevel structure model. The analysis accounts for two critical problems (selection bias and endogeneity) through an endogenous switching regression model. Generally, the results indicate the positive impacts of credit uptake on poverty alleviation and VEP reduction. Nevertheless, credit uptake increases VFP. Noticeably, compared to other categories of credit, productive credit is found to be more pronounced in reducing either idiosyncratic or covariate vulnerability. There is also suggestive evidence that although credit has positive effects overall, taking on either formal or semiformal credit has negative impacts on both poverty and vulnerability reduction. Hence, towards formal credit, government policies should concentrate more on credit costs and support preferential loan rates for poor rural households for productive purposes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Households; Poverty; Rural Credit; Rural Vietnam; Vulnerability To Poverty; Credit Provision; Empirical Analysis; Poverty; Regression Analysis; Rural Area; Vulnerability; Viet Nam","credit provision; empirical analysis; poverty; regression analysis; rural area; vulnerability; Viet Nam","","","","Adams, Dale W., Rural financial markets in low-income countries: Recent controversies and lessons, World Development, 14, 4, pp. 477-487, (1986); Econometrica, (1977); Austin, Peter C., An introduction to propensity score methods for reducing the effects of confounding in observational studies, Multivariate Behavioral Research, 46, 3, pp. 399-424, (2011); Characteristics of the Vietnamese Rural Economy Evidence from A 2016 Rural Household Survey in 12 Provinces of Viet Nam, (2017); Research Institute for Economics Business Administration Rieb Kobe University, (2012); Banerjee, Abhijit V., The miracle of microfinance?

Efficient water management is required to suppress the emission of methane from paddy fields, which is the major source of methane in agriculture. In addition, water saving is possible through improved water management as water resources are becoming scarce due to climate change and extreme weather. According to the authors, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is a promising option for reducing methane emissions from paddy rice and at the same time improving water-use efficiency. This is possible with the alteration in redox state of soil through AWD. Although its methane-reducing and water-saving effects were demonstrated by previous studies, AWD is not widely practiced in rice growing regions in Asia due to other associated challenges. To implement and realize the benefits of AWD at the systemic level, it is necessary to manage the irrigation system collectively by farmers. The chapter discusses in detail the practical AWD implementation through ‘block wise distribution of water’ managed by farmers themselves in the paddy district of the Red River Delta area in Vietnam. In addition, the institutional and technical issues supporting organizational environmental-friendly agricultural water management that will be needed to upscale AWD are discussed in the chapter. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abbott, Michael B., An introduction to the European Hydrological System - Systeme Hydrologique Europeen, ""SHE"", 1: History and philosophy of a physically-based, distributed modelling system, Journal of Hydrology, 87, 1-2, pp. 45-59, (1986); Abbott, Michael B., An introduction to the European Hydrological System - Systeme Hydrologique Europeen, ""SHE"", 2: Structure of a physically-based, distributed modelling system, Journal of Hydrology, 87, 1-2, pp. 61-77, (1986); Amin, M.G.

However, the right to education of ethnic minorities has remained ad-hoc and uneven across Vietnam's regions and ethnic groups. Drawing on the right of education 4A framework involving four components: availability, accessibility, acceptability, and adaptability, this chapter reviews 64 documents on relevant laws and national policies on a range of education levels, from basic education to higher education, for Vietnamese ethnic minorities. It provides insights into the right to education for these groups at the policy level. Its findings show that some critical aspects concerning the right to education have not been adequately addressed. In particular, there is a lack of contextual and cultural appropriateness in these policies which in turn affects their effective implementation.

Poor compliance with self-isolation could be a potential reason for the new outbreak. Our study aimed to find out the correlation between the rising new cases of COVID-19 and home-based patients in Japan. Methods: A secondary data analysis study was conducted with the data from COVID-19-involved databases collected from Johns Hopkins University, Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and Community Mobility Reports of Google. New community cases, stringency index, number of tests, and active cases were analyzed. Using a linear regression model, an independent variable was utilized for a given date to predict the future number of community cases. Results: Research results show that outpatient cases, the stringency, and Google Mobility Trend were all significantly associated with the number of COVID-19 community cases from the sixth day to the ninth day.

The previous studies have recently undertaken significant research on air pollution and air quality monitoring. Unfortunately, this area continues to be challenged by unresolved issues. This paper proposes an IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting System to monitor and predict air pollution for a specific area based on various pollution factors. Using Arduino UNO R3 and various low-cost sensors, our IoT system can collect and monitor pollutants, such as PM2.5, CO2, CO, as well as temperature and humidity. The air quality data was collected for several months. To overcome the problems of instability of low-cost devices in monitoring, machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as K-Nearest-Neighbour (KNN), Expectation-Maximization (EM), Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and Autoregressive-Moving-Average (ARMA), are applied to address missing data and outliers due to technical issues. The KNN model outperformed all others in terms of RMSE, MSE, MAE, R-squared, and execution time. Then, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms are applied to predict future air quality. The result shows that our system can predict the air quality factors over the next hour with the highest accuracy at 96 %. Finally, a web interface was created to monitor and forecast air quality in real-time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Quality Forecasting; Air Quality Monitoring; Arma; Em; Iot; Knn; Lstm; Mice; Air Quality; Costs; Forecasting; Internet Of Things; Learning Algorithms; Mammals; Maximum Principle; Nearest Neighbor Search; Air Quality Forecasting; Air Quality Monitoring; Autoregressive/moving Averages; Expectation Maximization; Iot; K-near-neighbor; Multiple Imputation; Multiple Imputation By Chained Equation; Nearest-neighbour; Quality Monitoring System; Long Short-term Memory","Air quality; Costs; Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Mammals; Maximum principle; Nearest neighbor search; Air quality forecasting; Air quality monitoring; Autoregressive/moving averages; Expectation Maximization; IoT; K-near-neighbor; Multiple imputation; Multiple imputation by chained equation; Nearest-neighbour; Quality monitoring system; Long short-term memory","","","","Vietnam Ranks 4th in the Number of Pollutionlinked Deaths in the Western Pacific Region, (2019); World Wide Web, (2011); Jo, Jun Ho, Development of an IoT-Based indoor air quality monitoring platform, Journal of Sensors, 2020, (2020); Grath, Sean Mc, IoT Personal Air Quality Monitor, (2020); Medeiros, Helton Pierre Lucena De, An IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring Platform, (2020); Management, (2020); Zheng, Hong, A multiple kernel learning approach for air quality prediction, Advances in Meteorology, 2018, (2018); Zhu, Dixian, A machine learning approach for air quality prediction: Model regularization and optimization, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 2, 1, pp. 1-15, (2018); Saini, Jagriti, Indoor air quality prediction using optimizers: A comparative study, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 39, 5, pp. 7053-7069, (2020); Mumtaz, Rafia, Internet of things (Iot) based indoor air quality sensing and predictive analytic—a covid-19 perspective, Electronics (Switzerland), 10, 2, pp. 1-26, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","EVN HCMC; IEEE; IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMC)","6th International Conference on Green Technology and Sustainable Development, GTSD 2022","","Nha Trang City; Nha Trang University, Khanh Hoa Province","185680","","9781665466288","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146436984"

These types of the state making have largely excluded local people’s rights of accessing and using natural resources, shaping different geographies of each area and livelihoods of ethnic minority people. This study aims to explore the process of state-making that has affected the socio-politico situations and livelihoods of ethnic minority people. Furthermore, the authors examine the local response to mitigate the state-making through the case study of Un village in Thanh Hoa Province, North Central Vietnam. The case study derives how Hmong people of Un village practice everyday forms of resistance to avoid the state surveillance. The result shows that the state implemented the forest land allocation, sedentarization program as a great effort to exercise controlling people and resources under the state’s surveillance. In turn, the Hmong refuse the use of land allocated by the state, expand the encroachment of shifting cultivation outside the village territory and tacit cultivation traditional medicine of Hmong people. By using the settlement pattern to create friction of distance from the state power, Hmong people successfully repelled the state surveillance. In sum up, this study implies that government policies and programs are not always implemented as they are planned, especially when they are far from the local reality.

We introduce VIMQA, a new Vietnamese dataset with over 10,000 Wikipedia-based multi-hop question-answer pairs. The dataset is human-generated and has four main features: (1) The questions require advanced reasoning over multiple paragraphs. (2) Sentence-level supporting facts are provided, enabling the QA model to reason and explain the answer. (3) The dataset offers various types of reasoning to test the model's ability to reason and extract relevant proof. (4) The dataset is in Vietnamese, a low-resource language. We also conduct experiments on our dataset using state-of-the-art Multilingual single-hop and multi-hop QA methods. The results suggest that our dataset is challenging for existing methods, and there is room for improvement in Vietnamese QA systems. In addition, we propose a general process for data creation and publish a framework for creating multilingual multi-hop QA datasets.

In addition, increased demands for “safe vegetables” have resulted from the emergence of a Vietnamese middle class and the rapid increase in the number of supermarkets in big cities, especially in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Cadilhon et al., 2006; Maruyama and Trung, 2007). In 2008, the Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practice (VietGAP) certification system was first introduced and received strong support from the Vietnamese government to deal with the problem of unsafe vegetable production resulting from the excessive use of agro-chemical inputs. The contradiction between the increasing demand for safe vegetables and limitations on the diffusion of the VietGAP vegetable production has prompted research initiatives to identify how the VietGAP implementation has impacted the country’s vegetable supply chain. The research presented in this chapter was conducted in the Duc Trong district, one of the main vegetable production areas in Vietnam. A field survey was conducted in June, 2019. In-depth interviews were carried out to collect information from 34 vegetable farmers and the eight VietGAP buyers by means of semi-structured questionnaires. The results of this research revealed that the implementation of the VietGAP has brought about the reorganization of stakeholders in the supply chain to develop a separate distribution channel for the “VietGAP vegetables”. The VietGAP has changed the relationship between VietGAP farmers and their buyers into a contractual one for the entire production period. As a result, the VietGAP buyers not only played the role of collectors, but also governed the whole process of VietGAP vegetable production. Notably, farmers’ decisions on switching to the VietGAP vegetable production were highly dependent on their relationships with VietGAP buyers. The use of social networks of farmers has played an important role in the transition to the VietGAP vegetable production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abebe, Gumataw Kifle, Are middlemen facilitators or barriers to improve smallholders' welfare in rural economies?

Today, many parts of the world are facing the problem of water shortage and this problem cannot be easily solved. In addition to the proper use of water resources and preventing the loss of natural water, the establishment of regional water supply networks is effective in meeting the future needs of the people. A water distribution network (water supply network) is a set of interconnected pipelines used to transport and distribute water in a complex. In designing the water distribution network, factors such as the type of water distribution network, water pressure, water velocity, design flow, minimum pipe diameter, pipe material and many other factors should be considered. In this study, we have tried to design the water supply network of a part of Balikpapan city in Indonesia. The design method led to the determination of pressure values in the connection nodes, pipe diameters, flow rate and velocity in the pipes. All the existing criteria are considered in the design of the water supply network. Although this study has been implemented for a specific study area, it can be of great help to designers in designing the water supply network. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Network Design; Water Distribution; Water Shortage; Water Supply Network; Water Transmission","","","","","Alonso, Mari Carmen, Tracing polar benzene- and naphthalenesulfonates in untreated industrial effluents and water treatment works by ion-pair chromatography-fluorescence and electrospray-mass spectrometry, Analytica Chimica Acta, 400, 1-3, pp. 211-231, (1999); Batish, Rajiv, A New Approach to the Design of Intermittent Water Supply Networks, pp. 405-415, (2003); Bensoltane, Mohamed Amine, Enhancement of the free residual chlorine concentration at the ends of the water supply network: Case study of Souk Ahras city - Algeria, Journal of Water and Land Development, 38, 1, pp. 3-9, (2018); Cunha, Maria Conceição, Water distribution network design optimization: Simulated annealing approach, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management - ASCE, 125, 4, pp. 215-221, (1999); Eusuff, Muzaffar M., Optimization of water distribution network design using the shuffled frog leaping algorithm, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management - ASCE, 129, 3, pp. 210-225, (2003); Fathollahi-Fard, Amir M., An adaptive Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm for a coordinated water supply and wastewater collection network design problem, Information Sciences, 512, pp. 1335-1359, (2020); Geem, Zong Woo, Cost efficient and practical design of water supply network using harmony search, African Journal of Agricultural Research, 6, 13, pp. 3110-3116, (2011); Gurung, Thulo Ram, Smart meter enabled water end-use demand data: Platform for the enhanced infrastructure planning of contemporary urban water supply networks, Journal of Cleaner Production, 87, 1, pp. 642-654, (2015); Herrera-León, Sebastián, Optimization Approach to Designing Water Supply Systems in Non-Coastal Areas Suffering from Water Scarcity, Water Resources Management, 32, 7, pp. 2457-2473, (2018); Ilyas, Muhammad Fraz, Environmental and health impacts of industrial wastewater effluents in Pakistan: A review, Reviews on Environmental Health, 34, 2, pp. 171-186, (2019)","","Polish Academy of Sciences Publishing House","","","","","","14297426; 20834535","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139762882"

Yet, some evidence has indicated that sparse numbers of non-Austronesian individuals continued to live in the remote mountains as late as the 1800s. The cranial morphometric study of human skeletal remains unearthed from the Xiaoma Caves in eastern Taiwan, for the first time, validates the prior existence of small stature hunter-gatherers 6000 years ago in the preceramic phase.

High-speed rail (HSR) has been mentioned recently and is expected as the best and most modern transport option in long-distance trips in Vietnam. However, research studies have paid scant regard to how HSR’s attributes may affect potential users, and therefore the motivations and barriers to adopting HSR are still unknown. Objectives: This study aimed at examining motivations and barriers to take-up HSR for considering customers’ preference on the proper attributes and levels of HSR. Method: This study drew on a nationwide survey and conjoint analysis to investigate customers’ behaviour. Results: In Vietnam’s context, HSR ticket was found to be the principal barrier to adoption, whereas the speed of HSR was identified as the least important behavioural driver amongst potential HSR users. The results show that HSR design and planning should provide a combination of minimum check-in and waiting time, a 20-min frequency, average speed of 250 km/h, all add-on services and facilities, ticketing of approximately VND 500-700 thousand per 300-500 km and nearby all-day parking. Conclusion: This investigation has demonstrated the value of conjoint analysis to compare a wide range of attributes associated with consumers’ decision to use HSR. The findings indicate that in countries such as Vietnam, in particular, where train usage is low, policymakers and transportation agencies seeking to boost the use of HSR must take attributes other than fare into consideration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attributes; Check-in And Waiting Time; Conjoint Analysis; High-speed Rail; Levels; Ticket Fare","","","","","Álvarez-SanJaime, Óscar, A model of internal and external competition in a High Speed Rail line, Economics of Transportation, 4, 3, pp. 178-187, (2015); Behrens, Christiaan, Intermodal competition in the London-Paris passenger market: High-Speed Rail and air transport, Journal of Urban Economics, 71, 3, pp. 278-288, (2012); Borhan, Muhamad Nazri Bin, Extending the theory of planned behaviour to predict the intention to take the new high-speed rail for intercity travel in Libya: Assessment of the influence of novelty seeking, trust and external influence, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 130, pp. 373-384, (2019); Borsati, Mattia, On the modal shift from motorway to high-speed rail: evidence from Italy, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 137, pp. 145-164, (2020); Campa, Juan Luis, High speed rail effects on tourism: Spanish empirical evidence derived from China's modelling experience, Journal of Transport Geography, 57, pp. 44-54, (2016); Asrdlf 2012 Conference Special Session on High Speed Rail Tourism and Territories, (2012); Passengers Choice Between High Speed Train and Air Transport, (2022); Gehrt, Kenneth C., Understanding preference for high-speed rail service: A consumer logistics perspective, Innovative Marketing, 3, 4, pp. 32-41, (2007); Decision 318 Qd Ttg on Approving the Strategy for Developing Transportation Service to 2020 Oriented to 2030, (2014); Journal of Consumer Research, (1978)","","AOSIS (pty) Ltd","","","","","","23108789; 19955235","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136807123"

It discusses burial practices, and associated evidence for dating, for 18 Hòabìnhian cave sites, three Đa Bút open air cemeteries, and a range of early burials from Thailand, Laos, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Key findings include: (1) burial practices from the Late Pleistocene through to the Mid-Holocene were clearly varied and diverse; (2) despite the earliest clear evidence of Anatomically Modern Human remains at circa 50,000 years ago, the first clear signs of deliberate mortuary behavior does not occur until circa 20,000 years ago; (3) three main burial positions can be observed: side flexed (body on side and legs/arms flexed), supine flexed (body on back with flexed legs/arms), and squatting (body seated/squatting in upright position), with no clear evidence for extended supine burial positioning until the Neolithic; (4) in general, during the Hòabìnhian individuals have either their feet or heads oriented toward cave openings, while in the Đa Bút cemeteries squatting burials (which are the norm) face in an easterly direction; (6) cremation and the use of ocher were not uncommon, while there is limited verifiable evidence for the use of grave goods in pre-Neolithic Southeast Asia. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Burial Practice; Hoabinhian; Mortuary; Neolithic; Variability; Vietnam","","","","","Crossing Borders in Southeast Asian Archaeology, (2012); Boivin, Nicole L., From veneration to exploitation: Human engagement with the mineral world, pp. 1-30, (2013); Bowler, James M., New ages for human occupation and climatic change at Lake Mungo, Australia, Nature, 421, 6925, pp. 837-840, (2003); Bao Cao Khai Quat Di Tich Van Hoa Da but Dua Diem Khao Co Hoc Con Co Ngtia Thanh Hoa, (1980); Nhng Phat Hien Moi Ve Khao Co Hoc Nam, (1980); Bulletin of the Indo Pacific Prehistory Association, (1991); Khao Co Hoc, (2002); Van Hoa Da but Va Qua Trinh Chiem Lnh Dong Bang Va Ven Bien Thanh Hoa Ninh Binh, (2003); Tham Sat Da but Ban Thuy Va C on Co Ngua Tu, (2002); Nhng Phat Hien Moi Ve Khao Co Hoc Nam, (2002)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","","9780199355358","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136662725"

This study presents a case study to examine the financial feasibility of developing and operating a new metro line through property value capture and land-use control in Hanoi. First, property prices are estimated with local data for both residential and office properties, using hedonic price models. Next, a travel demand model, including trip generation and attraction, trip distribution, and travel mode choice sub-models, is estimated with person trip survey data, following a conventional four-step model framework. Subsequently, multiple scenarios are built for a hypothetical investment in an MRT line in Hanoi. The scenarios are assumed considering socio-demographics and transportation infrastructure in the context of new taxation levied on local properties near MRT stations and land-use controls with respect to population and employment to increase their densities near MRT stations. The estimated models are applied to each scenario to estimate the expected financial viability of MRT development and operation. The results reveal that the property value capture and land-use control could significantly improve the operator's profitability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Cities; Financial Feasibility; Mass Rapid Transit; Property Value Capture; Transit-oriented Development","","","","The data on Japan's railway investment in the case study was partially provided by Tokyo Metro Co.

In other words, religious beliefs are indicative of the role of religion in the individual and social life of people, as well as adherence to values and beliefs in daily life, performing religious practices and rituals and participating in activities of religious organisations. Religious beliefs are a set of dos and don’ts, and values are considered one of the most important psychological supports that can provide meaning in all moments of life and save a person from meaninglessness by providing explanatory support in specific situations. In addition, work conscience is defined as a feeling of inner commitment to comply with agreed-upon requirements for work. In other words, work conscience means heartfelt satisfaction and practical commitment to the tasks that a person is supposed to perform properly, in a way that there will be no negligence in performing the duty even if no supervisor oversees the activity. Given the significant role of nurses in hospitals, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the religious beliefs of healthcare employees have become more important. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of religious beliefs on the work conscience of 1800 Muslim nurses in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Standard questionnaires were applied to assess the respondents’ religious beliefs and work conscience. In addition, data analyses (Cronbach’s alpha, Pearson’s correlation, etc.) were performed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). According to the results, religious beliefs have a positive effect on nurses’ work conscience (p = 0.822). Contribution: The findings of this study showed that the employees of an organisation, especially nurses and healthcare staff, can rely on their religious beliefs and benefit from their advantages in order to strengthen their work conscience during a hard time such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Muslim Nurses; Religion; Religious Beliefs; Work Conscience","","","","","Afshari, Davood, Demographic predictors of resilience among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Work, 68, 2, pp. 297-303, (2021); Berkman, Lisa F., The role of social relations in health promotion, Psychosomatic Medicine, 57, 3, pp. 245-254, (1995); Cerit, Birgül, Being a Nurse at the Ground Zero of Care in Turkey During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study, Journal of Religion and Health, 61, 1, pp. 827-850, (2022); Costa, Paul T., The five-factor model of personality and its relevance to personality disorders, Journal of Personality Disorders, 6, 4, pp. 343-359, (1992); Journal of Hacettepe University Faculty of Nursing, (2020); Fernandez, Ritin Santiago, Implications for COVID-19: A systematic review of nurses’ experiences of working in acute care hospital settings during a respiratory pandemic, International Journal of Nursing Studies, 111, (2020); Journal of Happiness Studies, (2002); Medrxiv, (2020); Hui, David Shu Cheong, The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health — The latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, International Journal of Infectious Diseases, 91, pp. 264-266, (2020); Jiang, Lixin, Meaningful Work and Affective Commitment: A Moderated Mediation Model of Positive Work Reflection and Work Centrality, Journal of Business and Psychology, 33, 4, pp. 545-558, (2018)","","AOSIS (pty) Ltd","","","","","","20728050; 02599422","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134183204"

Results indicated that in the 1990s, dominant LULC types were arable cropland, wetland, and permanent crops, which covered approximately half of the delta, 28% and 8%, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the wetland area decreased from 28% to 5% due to the expansion of aquaculture and the arable cropland. The aquaculture, however, expanded more rapidly than other land use conversions, namely, from 2% to 19%. Although mangrove forests slightly recovered by 58 km2 from 2005 to 2019, the overall trend (1990-2019) showed an intense loss of 740 km2 due to widespread conversions into aquaculture.

This paper proposed a fog computing enabled hydroponic farming framework that devises low-cost data collection and novel data analysis mechanisms to deliver intelligent farming systems. In this framework, the data from multiple IoT sensors at the garden are collected, filtered and analyzed by artificial neural network (ANN) models deployed at the fog landscapes, while the ANN models are trained in the cloud with a large amount of historical farming data. This approach allows the intelligent models being updated, reducing the communication cost and response time, while utilizing computing resources available on the network edge. The evaluation results on the developed prototype depict the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed approach revealing that it is feasible and ready to be applied in real-world applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ann; Data Mining; Fog Computing; Iot; Smart Farming","","","","We would like to thank Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for the support of time and facilities for this study.","What is the Iot Everything You Need to Know about the Internet of Things Right Now, (2020); Environment Control with Low Cost Microcontrollers and Microprocessors Application for Green Walls, (2019); Vietnam Investment Review, (2018); Big Data in the Cloud Why Cloud Computing is the Answer to Your Big Data Initiatives, (2018); Fog Computing and the Internet of Things Extend the Cloud to Where the Things are, (2015); Third International Conference on Informatics Applications Icia2014, (2014); Cleland, John G.F., World Population Growth; Past, Present and Future, Environmental and Resource Economics, 55, 4, pp. 543-554, (2013); World Population Prospects 2019, (2019); Pimentel, David P., Soil erosion threatens food production, Agriculture (Switzerland), 3, 3, pp. 443-463, (2013); International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology, (2013)","","River Publishers","","","","","","15504646; 15504654","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130600251"

To estimate traffic condition, accurately and timely traffic data must be sensed frequently at every location around the city utilizing multimedia data fusion and analytics. This paper proposes a novel approach to urban traffic data collection and analysis leveraging crowd-sourced data from drivers and mobile users. Concretely, we have proposed solutions for mobile crowd-sourced data fusion to which just the right traffic data is collected automatically by GPS modules equipped in mobile devices. In addition, mechanisms for data validation and analytics for traffic estimation have been devised. Consequently, a mobile application is developed and provided to public users so that they can conveniently collect and share traffic data to the system. Besides, users can access traffic information and ITS services such as routing recommendation freely. The proposed system has been deployed for a real-world application in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the largest city in Vietnam.

Since the mid-1960s, Japan has placed a strong focus on teacher factors for improving the quality of education. Japan, mainly through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has been providing support to strengthen teacher capacity by working together with partner countries through trial and error on the ground. As the education agenda and practices place increasing emphasis on learning in the 2010s, JICA’s focus is shifting from “teacher capacity” to “children’s learning” by paying attention to consistency and coherence between curriculum, textbooks, lessons, and assessment. This chapter describes the features of and changes to Japanese approaches in this field by dividing it into five stages. The chapter also discusses the historical background of each stage and connections between the stages. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Basic Education; Children’s Learning; Japan’s Oda; Learning Assessment; Mathematics And Science Education; Teacher Capacity; Teachers’ Classroom Practices; Textbook Development; Universal Primary Education","","","","Consequently, in FY 1966, Japan started dispatching science education experts and providing the equipment they would need for instruction. The Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency (OTCA), the forerunner of JICA, was commissioned and financed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to carry out the program (JICA, 1981). Specifically, five countries were selected every year from among those in Asia and Africa. One science education expert4 (physics or chemistry) was dispatched to each of the partner countries, staying there for 6 months to give guidance and advice on science education. The countries were also provided with the equipment (three million yen per country) necessary for their instruction (Hayashi, 1970). The five countries selected for the first year were Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kenya, and Iran. In subsequent decades, one expert (or in some cases two) was dispatched to each country, mainly countries in Asia.","Ad Hoc Council on Educational Cooperation for Asian Countries, (1972); Akyeampong, Kwame, Improving teaching and learning of basic maths and reading in Africa: Does teacher preparation count?, International Journal of Educational Development, 33, 3, pp. 272-282, (2013); undefined; From, (2002); undefined; From, (2015); Monthly Journal of Monbusho, (1970); Firipin no Rika Kyoiku, (1969); Tai no Rika Kyoiku, (1969); Journal of International Cooperation in Education, (2011)","","Springer","","","","","","22149791; 15735397","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127910880"

The statistical population included all ninth-grade students from lower secondary schools for girls located in the city of Tehran, Iran, in 2019-2020. For this purpose, applied research with a quasiexperimental design was employed to meet the study objectives. To select the statistical sample, the convenience sampling method was used, so one school equipped with the essential facilities was chosen to implement the ICT-based education. Then, two classrooms at the given school were selected as the experimental and control groups, each one consisting of 27 students, based on the random sampling method. The research tool was the 15-item Academic Enthusiasm Questionnaire (AEQ) containing behavioral, emotional, and cognitive subscales, and recruiting a five-point Likert-Type scale. All the classrooms initially received a pretest, and then the experimental group was instructed by the ICT-based education. Finally, all the study groups completed a posttest. Moreover, inferential and descriptive statistics were applied for data analysis. The study results demonstrated a significant difference in terms of the baseline academic enthusiasm between the experimental and control groups. In addition, the ICT-based method of instruction showed stronger effects on students' academic enthusiasm than the conventional one. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abdalqader, Mohammed A., The prevalence of bullying and it's associated factors among one of high school students in Selangor, Malaysia, Malaysian Journal of Public Health Medicine, 18, 2, pp. 52-56, (2018); Akbay, Sinem Evin, Academic risk taking behavior in university students: Academic procrastination, academic locus of control, and academic perfectionism, Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 2020, 89, pp. 159-178, (2020); Ardıç, Özdenur, ICT competence and needs of Turkish EFL instructors: The role of gender, institution and experience, Eurasian Journal of Applied Linguistics, 5, 1, pp. 153-173, (2019); Adinda, Anita, Investigation of students’ metacognitive awareness failures about solving absolute value problems in mathematics education*, Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 2021, 95, pp. 17-35, (2021); Ahmed, Rashad Ali, Online and face-to-face peer review in academic writing: Frequency and preferences, Eurasian Journal of Applied Linguistics, 7, 1, pp. 169-201, (2021); Human Resource Management Research Scientific Academic Publishing, (2015); African Research Review, (2014); Antelm-Lanzat, Ana María, Learning styles and vocational guidance in secondary education, Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice, 20, 3, pp. 1-15, (2020); Shanlax International Journal of Education, (2019); Davoudi, Seyed Mehdi Mousavi, Testing the mediating role of open innovation on the relationship between intellectual property rights and organizational performance: A case of science and technology park, Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, 14, 4, pp. 1359-1369, (2018)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","20904010; 20904002","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127500631"

This study was designed to investigate the brain activity of a senior driver in response to simulated unexpected vehicle motion, compared with a relaxed state and normal driving. Methods: To accomplish this, we created a driving simulator paradigm wherein participants were involved in one of the following three scenarios: sitting down and relaxing, normal driving around the city with traffic signals and other vehicles, and the exiting of a parking area. In the scenario where the driver was to exit the parking area, the gear was switched automatically by the CarMaker software without the driver being notified, leading to an unexpected condition. The driver’s internal states were classified by artificial intelligence, based on information obtained through four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Significant differences were observed between the hemodynamic responses obtained in the three conditions. Ultimately, this method can be used to update advanced driver assistance systems, with a view to preventing future traffic accidents, by activating in-vehicle safety functions based on the driver’s condition. Conclusions: A driver’s internal states in a panic situation while driving can be detected using near-infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adas; Machine Learning; Nirs; Panic; Unexpected Conditions; Artificial Intelligence; Car Driving; Human; Motion; Near Infrared Spectroscopy; Prevention And Control; Traffic Accident; Accidents, Traffic; Artificial Intelligence; Automobile Driving; Humans; Motion; Spectroscopy, Near-infrared","artificial intelligence; car driving; human; motion; near infrared spectroscopy; prevention and control; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Artificial Intelligence; Automobile Driving; Humans; Motion; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","","","This study was partially supported by DENSO Corporation and by the Center of Innovation Program (Nagoya University COI: Mobility Innovation Center) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency.","Aghajani, Haleh, Measuring mental workload with EEG+fNIRS, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 11, (2017); undefined, (2010); Dong, Yanchao, Driver inattention monitoring system for intelligent vehicles: A review, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 12, 2, pp. 596-614, (2011); Engström, Johan A., Effects of visual and cognitive load in real and simulated motorway driving, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 8, 2 SPEC.

Prior research identified a calcified Echinococcus granulosis cyst, which causes hydatid disease. Osteolytic lesions consistent with hydatid disease were also present in this individual and others. Hydatid disease is observed in high frequencies in pastoralists, and its presence in a hunter-gatherer community raises questions regarding human-animal interaction prior to farming. The objective of this article is to identify and describe the epidemiology of hydatid disease in the human skeletal assemblage at Con Co Ngua. Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty-five individuals were macroscopically assessed for lesions. Of these, eight individuals were radiographed. Hydatid disease was diagnosed using a new threshold criteria protocol derived from clinical literature, which prioritizes lesions specific to the parasite. Results: Twenty-two individuals (14.2%) presented with osteolytic lesions consistent with hydatid disease, affecting the distal humerus, proximal femur and forearm, and pelvis. Seven individuals radiographed (4.5%) had multilocular cystic lesions strongly diagnostic for hydatid disease. All probable cases had lesions of the distal humerus. The remaining lesions were macroscopically identical to those radiographed and were considered possible cases. Discussion: While hydatid disease has previously been found in pre-agricultural communities, the high prevalence at Con Co Ngua is non-incidental. We propose that the presence of wild canids and management of wild buffalo and deer increased the risk of disease transmission. These findings further reveal subsistence complexity among hunter-gatherers living millennia prior to the adoption of farming in Southeast Asia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Transition; Forager Farmer; South East Asia; Zoonosis; Adolescent; Adult; Agricultural Worker; Article; Bone Atrophy; Bone Radiography; Community; Controlled Study; Distal Humerus; Echinococcosis; Echinococcus Granulosus; Female; Forager; Forearm; Human; Macroscopy; Major Clinical Study; Male; Microscopy; Middle Aged; Nonhuman; Pelvis; Proximal Femur; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Young Adult; Animal; Canidae; Cyst; Deer; Echinococcus; Epidemiology; Radiography; Animals; Cysts; Deer; Echinococcosis; Humans; Radiography; Vietnam","adolescent; adult; agricultural worker; Article; bone atrophy; bone radiography; community; controlled study; distal humerus; echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus; female; forager; forearm; human; macroscopy; major clinical study; male; microscopy; middle aged; nonhuman; pelvis; proximal femur; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; young adult; animal; Canidae; cyst; deer; Echinococcus; epidemiology; radiography; Animals; Cysts; Deer; Echinococcosis; Humans; Radiography; Vietnam","","","Funding text 1: The study was supported by grant sponsors: Australian Research Council DP110101097, FT120100299; National Geographic Society EC‐54332R‐18; Royal Society of New Zealand Skinner Fund Grant; and a University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship.; Funding text 2: Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Numbers: DP110101097, FT120100299; National Geographic Society, Grant/Award Number: EC‐54332R‐18; Royal Society of New Zealand Skinner Fund; University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship Funding information","Agarwal, Shekhar, Hydatid bone disease of the pelvis: A report of two cases and review of the literature, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 280, pp. 251-255, (1992); Antikas, Theodore G., Hydatidosis of a Pregnant Woman of the 3rd Century bc, Greece, International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 26, 5, pp. 920-924, (2016); Appleby, Jo E.P., Increasing confidence in paleopathological diagnosis - Application of the Istanbul terminological framework, International Journal of Paleopathology, 8, pp. 19-21, (2015); Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture, (1984); Armelagos, George John, The origins of agriculture: Population growth during a period of declining health, Population and Environment, 13, 1, pp. 9-22, (1991); Barker, Graeme W.W., Foraging-Farming Transitions in Island Southeast Asia, Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, 20, 2, pp. 256-280, (2013); Beggs, Ian G., The radiology of hydatid disease, American Journal of Roentgenology, 145, 3, pp. 639-648, (1985); Bellwood, Peter S., The expansions of farming societies and the role of the Neolithic demographic transition, pp. 13-34, (2008); Brooks, S.

This study aims to analyze the local context in motorcycle-based societies, which may affect the establishment of travelers’ choice set after the appearance of RHSs. In particular, it empirically compares three types of choice-set structures in the context of urban travel mode choice by estimating standard logit and nested logit models to test six hypotheses on the associations of RHS adoption with its determinants. Revealed preference data of 449 trips from both RHS users and non-RHS users were collected through a face-to-face interview-based questionnaire survey in Hanoi, Vietnam, in December 2020. The results of model estimations revealed: (1) a substitutional effect for two-wheelers but not for four-wheelers, (2) a significant positive influence of car ownership on car RHS adoption but not on motorcycle RHS adoption, (3) significantly high sensitivity to travel time of motorcycle RHS but not of car RHS, (4) a significant negative effect of traffic congestion on car RHS adoption but an insignificant one on motorcycle RHS adoption, and (5) a significant positive association of an individual’s experience in using a smartphone with car RHSs but insignificant association with motorcycle RHSs. Our findings suggest that transportation policies of RHS motorcycles should be different from those of RHS cars because of the heterogeneity in travel behaviors of RHS users between them. They also indicate that the transition from motorcycles to cars as well as the difference in service availability among different types of RHSs should be incorporated into the development of transportation policies in Southeast Asian cities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Local Context; Mode Choice; Motorcycle-based Society; Ride-hailing Service; Car Ownership; Ownership; Questionnaire Survey; Traffic Congestion; Transport Vehicle; Travel Time; Hanoi; Viet Nam","car ownership; ownership; questionnaire survey; traffic congestion; transport vehicle; travel time; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This study was financially supported by a Kajima Foundation’s International Joint Research Grant.","Mobility on Demand Operational Concept Report, (2017); Shen, Hui, Modeling travel mode choice of young people with differentiated E-hailing ride services in Nanjing China, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 78, (2020); Ma, Ye, Spatial heterogeneous characteristics of ridesharing in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region of China, Energies, 11, 11, (2018); Acheampong, Ransford A., Mobility-on-demand: An empirical study of internet-based ride-hailing adoption factors, travel characteristics and mode substitution effects, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 115, (2020); Giddy, Julia Kathryn, The influence of e-hailing apps on urban mobilities in South Africa, African Geographical Review, 38, 3, pp. 227-239, (2019); Tirachini, Alejandro, Ride-hailing, travel behaviour and sustainable mobility: an international review, Transportation, 47, 4, pp. 2011-2047, (2020); Chalermpong, Saksith, Bangkok, Thailand, pp. 207-227, (2019); de Sa, Ana Luiza Santos, Methodological proposal for stated preference scenarios regarding an exploratory evaluation of ride-hailing implications on transit: A Brazilian context analysis, Case Studies on Transport Policy, 9, 4, pp. 1727-1736, (2021); Khattak, Zulqarnain H., Ride-hailing and taxi versus walking: Long term forecasts and implications from large-scale behavioral data, Journal of Transport and Health, 22, (2021); Kang, Shuqing, Pooled versus private ride-hailing: A joint revealed and stated preference analysis recognizing psycho-social factors, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 124, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122505437"

However, minimizing both the variance and bias of the estimate is a challenge due to the trade-off between the two. In many countries, tourism accommodation statistics, which popularly developed with the unbiased linear estimator, are less accurate. This study recommends an integration of bootstrap and regression to overcome the challenge. An unbiased linear estimator is used as a benchmark to investigate the integration method’s effectiveness. With realistic accommodation data in Japan, we found that the integration method yields more than two times more accurate results than the unbiased linear estimator.

If the solutions of this problem are not suitable, it can cause undesirable damage to the patient when exercising. Normally, the problem of Inverse Kinematics in the robotics field, as well as the natural field, especially for redundant driven systems, often requires the application of a lot of techniques. The redundancy in Degree of Freedom (DoF), the nonlinearity of the system leads to solve inverse kinematics problem more challenge. In this study, we proposed to apply the self-adaptive control parameters in Differential Evolution with search space improvement (Pro-ISADE) to solve the problem for the human upper limb, which is a very typical redundancy model in nature. First of all, the angles of the joints were measured by a proposed Exoskeleton type Human Motion Capture System (E-HMCS) when the wearer performs some Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and athletic activities. The values of these measured angles joints then were put into the forward kinematics model to find the end effector trajectories. After having these orbits, they were re-fed into the proposed Pro-ISADE algorithm mentioned above to process the IK problem and obtain the predicted joints angular values. The experimental results showed that the predicted joints’ values closely follow the measured joints’ values. That demonstrates the ability to apply the Pro-ISADE algorithm to solve the problem of Inverse Kinetics of the human upper limb as well as the upper limb rehabilitation robot arm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activities Of Daily Living (adl); Exoskeleton Type Motion Capture System (e-hmcs); Inverse Kinematics (ik); Optimization Algorithm; Degrees Of Freedom (mechanics); Evolutionary Algorithms; Exoskeleton (robotics); Inverse Kinematics; Joints (anatomy); Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Optimization; Redundancy; Robots; Activities Of Daily Living; Differential Evolution; End-effector Trajectory; Optimization Algorithms; Rehabilitation Robot; Rehabilitation Robotics; Self Adaptive Control; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Inverse Problems","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Evolutionary algorithms; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Inverse kinematics; Joints (anatomy); Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Optimization; Redundancy; Robots; Activities of Daily Living; Differential Evolution; End-effector trajectory; Optimization algorithms; Rehabilitation robot; Rehabilitation robotics; Self adaptive control; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Inverse problems","","","Funding text 1: Research reported in this paper was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam, under award number [ĐTĐLCN.28/20].; Funding text 2: This work was also supported by the Centennial SIT Action for the 100th anniversary of Shibaura Institute of Technology entering the top 10 at the Asian Institute of Technology.","J Comput Sci Technol, (2013); Dereli, Serkan, Simulation based calculation of the inverse kinematics solution of 7-DOF robot manipulator using artificial bee colony algorithm, SN Applied Sciences, 2, 1, (2020); Fan, Shimeng, Optimum manipulator path generation based on improved differential evolution constrained optimization algorithm, International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems, 16, 5, (2019); Huang, Hsuchih, Particle swarm optimization for solving the inverse kinematics of 7-DOF robotic manipulators, Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 3105-3110, (2012); Hwang, Beomsoo, A method to accurately estimate the muscular torques of human wearing exoskeletons by Torque sensors, Sensors, 15, 4, pp. 8337-8357, (2015); Karpińska, Joanna, Approximation of jacobian inverse kinematics algorithms: Differential geometric vs. variational approach, Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications, 68, 3-4, pp. 211-224, (2012); Kenwright, Benjamin, Inverse kinematic solutions for articulated characters using massively parallel architectures and differential evolutionary algorithms, pp. 67-74, (2013); Kim, Hyunchul, Predicting Redundancy of a 7 DOF Upper Limb Exoskeleton Toward Improved Transparency between Human and Robot, Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications, 80, pp. 99-119, (2015); Köker, Rasit, A neuro-genetic-simulated annealing approach to the inverse kinematics solution of robots: a simulation based study, Engineering with Computers, 32, 4, pp. 553-565, (2016); Kuo, Yonglin, Experimental and numerical study on the semi-closed loop control of a planar parallel robot manipulator, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2014, (2014)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15737462; 02692821","","AIRVE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109880448"

Undeveloped streets, despite their lower quality and fewer amenities, still prove to have a certain attraction to urban residents. This study explores users’ perceived usage of street space based on physical and non-physical attributes that help fill the knowledge gap in street design and development. The results show that higher-income individuals tend to gather and participate in activities on modern streets, while lower-income individuals have a tendency to use undeveloped streets. This result supports the hypothesis that differences in demography can lead to differences in environmental perceptions. These findings also provide empirical evidence of the irrationality of street improvement in Vietnam, which primarily focuses on physical factors but omits non-physical elements.

Applying miscellaneous features of Landsat-8 images, the ELUC of a random-forest-based algorithm produces sequences of single-time classifications with a mean overall accuracy of 84%. Through the study period, these sequences of individual classifications were then joined to achieve a final classification which reaches an overall accuracy of 94%. Also, the ELUC of the random-forest-based algorithm outperforms that of Kernel-Density-Estimation with a 5% overall accuracy higher.

The cutting pattern panels can be determined by this process considering the effect of prescribed pre-stress and material properties. Several examples are performed to point out the effectiveness of the proposed method on simplifying the cutting pattern process and the reduction in the stress deviation from the intended pre-stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ale Formulations; Chinese Hat Type; Cone Type; Cutting Pattern; Hp Type; Membrane Structures; 3d Configurations; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Formulations; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Method; Cutting Patterns; Eulerian; Lagrangian; Tensile Membrane Structures; Threedimensional (3-d); Lagrange Multipliers","Membrane structures; 3d configurations; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulations; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method; Cutting patterns; Eulerian; Lagrangian; Tensile membrane structures; Threedimensional (3-d); Lagrange multipliers","","","This research is funded by Funds for Science and Technology Development of the University of Danang under project number B2019-DN02-69.","Bletzinger, Kai Uwe, Variation of Reference Strategy - A Novel Approach for Generating Optimized Cutting Patterns of Membrane Structures, Procedia Engineering, 155, pp. 131-141, (2016); Brew, John S., Spline-based and stress-monitored patterning of fabric structures, Computers and Structures, 119, pp. 203-214, (2013); Cívalek, Ömer, Eigenvalues of membranes having skew and rhombic geometry using discrete singular convolution algorithm, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 14, 11, pp. 4003-4009, (2009); Ersoy, Hakan, Free vibration of circular and annular membranes with varying density by the method of discrete singular convolution, Structural Engineering and Mechanics, 32, 5, pp. 621-634, (2009); Gale, Stuart, Patterning of tensile fabric structures with a discrete element model using dynamic relaxation, Computers and Structures, 169, pp. 112-121, (2016); Haber, Robert Bruce, Contact-slip analysis using mixed displacements, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 109, 2, pp. 411-429, (1983); Hughes, Thomas J.R., Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element formulation for incompressible viscous flows, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 29, 3, pp. 329-349, (1981); Ishii, Kazuo, Form finding analysis in consideration of cutting patterns of membrane structures, International Journal of Space Structures, 14, 2, pp. 105-119, (1999); Kim, Jae-yeol, A new technique for optimum cutting pattern generation of membrane structures, Engineering Structures, 24, 6, pp. 745-756, (2002); Linhard, Johannes, Introducing cutting patterns in form finding and structural analysis, Computational Methods in Applied Sciences, 8, pp. 69-84, (2008)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13472852; 13467581","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095740272"

In this study, we construct a small open economy model with financial frictions to generate the countercyclical movement in credit standards. Our analysis demonstrates that countercyclical fluctuations in credit standards work as an amplifier of shocks to the economy. In particular, the existence of endogenous credit standards increases output volatility by 21%. We also suggest three alternative tools for policymakers to dampen the effects of endogenous credit standards on macroeconomic volatility. First, the introduction of credit growth to the monetary policy succeeds in counteracting the fluctuation of lending, and thus decreasing the additional volatility considerably. Second, the exchange rate augmented monetary policy, if well-constructed, is considered an efficient tool to eliminate most of the additional fluctuations caused by deep habits in the banking sector. Finally, the introduction of the foreign interest augmented policy also proves successful in dampening the effect of endogenous movements in lending standards. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aggregate Fluctuations; Collateral Requirements; Credit Standards; Deep Habits; Dsge Modeling; Monetary Policy; Small Open Economy","","","","","Dynare Reference Manual Version 4, (2011); Afrin, Sadia, Does oligopolistic banking friction amplify small open economy's business cycles?

It draws on computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to computationally model, track, and classify human emotions and affective states. While the US once dominated the field in terms of research and citation from 1995–2015, China is now emerging as a global contender in research output, claiming second place for the most cited country from 2016–2020. This article maps the rhizomatic growth and development of scientific publications devoted to emotion-sensing AI technologies. It employs a bibliometric analysis that identifies major national contributors and international alliances in the field over the past 25 years. Contrary to the ongoing political rhetoric of a new Cold War, we argue that there are in fact vibrant AI research alliances and ongoing collaborations between the West and China, especially with the US, despite competing interests and ethical concerns. Our observations of historical data indicate two major collaborative networks: the “US/Asia-Pacific cluster” consisting of the US, China, Singapore, Japan and the “European” cluster of Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Our analysis also uncovers a major shift in the focus of affective computing research away from diagnosis and detection of mental illnesses to more commercially viable applications in smart city design.

The proposed model has unique characteristics that allow the government to protect social welfare while still providing opportunities for private investors to achieve their optimal toll rates. It also provides room to the government for negotiating with private investors while taking into account travelers' benefits and risk identification. The model is applied to a case study in Hanoi, Vietnam; and successfully showed its applicability with empirical evidences.

The students were asked to choose a most significant moral problem of AI applications in the future from a list of ten ethical issues and to write an essay about it. The results show that most of the students (n = 269, 58%) considered unemployment to be the major ethical issue related to AI. The second largest group of students (n = 54, 12%) was concerned with ethical issues related to emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and emotion and robots’ rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students referred to the risk of social control by AI (6%), AI discrimination (6%), increasing inequality (5%), loss of privacy (4%), AI mistakes (3%), malicious AI (3%), and AI security breaches (3%). Calculation of the z score for two population proportions shows that Japanese students were much less concerned about AI control of society (− 3.1276, p < 0.01) than non-Japanese students, but more concerned about discrimination (2.2757, p < 0.05).

Questionnaire TPI indicators are important to obtain valid direct comparisons between teachers in Africa and Asia. The process of developing a questionnaire served as an avenue for researchers from Asian and African regions to learn about TPI pointers from each other. This study used the Delphi technique to achieve consensus on valid TPI indicators across African and Asian regions. Fourteen researchers from the Asia-Africa University Dialogue Network for Educational Development (AAD) were selected using purposive sampling. TPI in this study is defined as a multifaceted concept comprising contextual and personal factors that differ across national borders. The indicators in the questionnaire represented personal, social and institutional factors perceived by teachers and outlined in the literature. In the Delphi study process, the researchers used three rounds to validate the initial 40-item TPI questionnaire. Subsequent analysis of the results indicated high importance and consensus among experts. Owing to its standardized procedure, the TPI questionnaire makes it possible to collect and compare the TPI dimensions from the different socio-economic contexts in which teachers work in Africa and Asia. The findings of this study guide African and Asian researchers on the common understanding of TPI characteristics prevalent across African and Asian regions.

The dataset consists of 282 groundwater samples collected in dry and rainy seasons between 2017 and 2018. Multiple physio-chemical parameters, groundwater quality index (GWQI), and irrigation water quality indices (IWQI) were employed to evaluate the suitability of groundwater resources for drinking and irrigation purposes. Thereupon, the hazard quotient (HQ), and total hazard index (HI) were used to assess the non-carcinogenic risks to different demographic groups. GWQI indicates that groundwater samples are excellent (41.5%), good (40.4%), poor (17%), and very poor (1.1%) classes for drinking purpose. The total hazard index (HI) indicated that 15.2%, 8.5%, 7.4%, and 7.1% of samples express non-carcinogenic health threats to infants, females, children, and males. Irrigation water quality indices (IWQI), namely, EC, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), soluble sodium percent (SSP), permeability index (PI), and magnesium hazard (MH), reveal that 82.2%, 94%, 20.2%, 69.6%, 45.4% and 12.8% of samples have EC < 2250 μS/cm, SAR <26, RSBC <1.25, SSP <60%, PI > 75%, and MH < 50%, respectively, which are suitable for irrigation use. Wilcox diagram shows that 17.54% of total groundwater samples exceed the permissible levels of salt-tolerant crops and solidity hazards in the study area. Furthermore, high concentrations of nitrate (>50 mg/L) and chloride (>1000 mg/L) were detected in the shallow, intermediate, and deep aquifers. GWQI and IWQ maps imply that groundwater in the South-western area is suitable, whereas groundwater in the central area is not recommended for any purpose. These findings provide useful insights into the vulnerable groundwater system of the coastal lowland area of the Mekong Delta related to human activities (agricultural practices, dam construction) and global climate change impacts. Accordingly, appropriate management strategies for water resources and mitigation solutions are imperatively needed to ensure the sustainability of the groundwater resource and the protection of public health in the Mekong Delta. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coastal Aquifers; Geochemistry; Human Health Risk Assessment; Mekong Delta; Multi-groundwater Quality Assessment; Aquifers; Chlorine Compounds; Climate Change; Crops; Groundwater Geochemistry; Hazards; Health; Health Risks; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Irrigation; Potable Water; Quality Control; Risk Assessment; Sodium Bicarbonate; Water Quality; Coastal Aquifers; Coastal Lowland; Groundwater Quality Assessment; Groundwater Quality Indices; Human Health Risk Assessment; Irrigation Water Quality; Mekong Delta; Multi-groundwater Quality Assessment; Viet Nam; Water Quality Indexes; Groundwater Resources; Bicarbonate; Chemical Composition; Groundwater Resource; Health Risk; Risk Assessment; Trace Element; Water Quality","Aquifers; Chlorine compounds; Climate change; Crops; Groundwater geochemistry; Hazards; Health; Health risks; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Irrigation; Potable water; Quality control; Risk assessment; Sodium bicarbonate; Water quality; Coastal aquifers; Coastal lowland; Groundwater quality assessment; Groundwater quality indices; Human health risk assessment; Irrigation water quality; Mekong Delta; Multi-groundwater quality assessment; Viet Nam; Water quality indexes; Groundwater resources; bicarbonate; chemical composition; groundwater resource; health risk; risk assessment; trace element; water quality","","","","Abdelwaheb, Mohamed, Adsorption of nitrate, phosphate, nickel and lead on soils: Risk of groundwater contamination, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 179, pp. 182-187, (2019); Adimalla, Narsimha, Groundwater Quality for Drinking and Irrigation Purposes and Potential Health Risks Assessment: A Case Study from Semi-Arid Region of South India, Exposure and Health, 11, 2, pp. 109-123, (2019); Adimalla, Narsimha, Heavy metals pollution assessment and its associated human health risk evaluation of urban soils from Indian cities: a review, Environmental Geochemistry and Health, 42, 1, pp. 173-190, (2020); Adimalla, Narsimha, Groundwater quality evaluation using water quality index (WQI) for drinking purposes and human health risk (HHR) assessment in an agricultural region of Nanganur, south India, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 176, pp. 153-161, (2019); Adimalla, Narsimha, Groundwater chemistry, distribution and potential health risk appraisal of nitrate enriched groundwater: A case study from the semi-urban region of South India, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 207, (2021); Adimalla, Narsimha, Evaluation of groundwater contamination for fluoride and nitrate in semi-arid region of Nirmal Province, South India: A special emphasis on human health risk assessment (HHRA), Human and Ecological Risk Assessment, 25, 5, pp. 1107-1124, (2019); Adimalla, Narsimha, Groundwater chemistry integrating the pollution index of groundwater and evaluation of potential human health risk: A case study from hard rock terrain of south India, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 206, (2020); Alcérreca-Huerta, Juan Carlos, Dam implications on salt-water intrusion and land use within a tropical estuarine environment of the Gulf of Mexico, Science of the Total Environment, 652, pp. 1102-1112, (2019); Ali, Ameena, Assessment of trace inorganic contaminates in water and sediment to address its impact on common fish varieties along Kuwait Bay, Environmental Geochemistry and Health, 43, 2, pp. 855-883, (2021); Anim-Gyampo, Maxwell, Quality and health risk assessment of shallow groundwater aquifers within the Atankwidi basin of Ghana, Groundwater for Sustainable Development, 9, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","2352801X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122818486"

Can Tho city is characterized by scarce water resources and intense industrial, domestic, agricultural, and mining usage, creating water stress. The vertical compaction rates and thus land subsidence, resulting from a head drawdown in three aquifers, were calculated using 1D consolidation of compressible porous media. Experiments were conducted in 16 wells clusters consisting of a total of 48 shallow and deep wells. The three wells from every 16 well clusters from different aquifers, namely the Middle-Upper Pleistocene confined aquifer (qp<inf>2-3</inf>), the Upper-Pleistocence (qp<inf>3</inf>), and a well in Holocene (qh), respectively, were examined. The Mann Kendal test with Sen's slope was performed and for most of the wells, negative values of Kendall's tau were found, which indicated decreasing trend of groundwater level. A significant change in groundwater level were also detected during the last eighteen years from 2000 to 2018. The results show significant downward trends of groundwater level for all of the wells of aquifer qp<inf>3</inf> and qp<inf>2-3</inf> except for a few shallow wells. The trend of this dropdown groundwater level for these deep wells is highly associated with extraction rates. The average subsidence rate of 4.28 cm yr−1 were observed in the study area. Tra Noc Industrial zones (QT8, QT16) showed a high subsidence rate which ranges from 5 to 7 cm yr−1. The calculated subsidence rates indicate the ongoing groundwater overexploitation, which might place Can Tho at risk of increased flooding and saltwater intrusion in the context of climate change and sea-level rise. The findings of this study call for effective policy strategies for sustainable water resource management to limit further land subsidence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Can Tho; Groundwater Levels; Hydrogeology; Land Subsidence; Mann Kendal Test; Aquifers; Climate Change; Groundwater Resources; Porous Materials; Salt Water Intrusion; Sea Level; Subsidence; Water Conservation; Water Levels; Water Management; Can Tho; Deep Wells; Ground Water Level; Land Subsidence; Mann Kendal Test; Qualitative Changes; Quantitative Changes; Shallow Wells; Spatio-temporal Variation; Viet Nam; Hydrogeology; Confined Aquifer; Groundwater; Groundwater Abstraction; Groundwater Resource; Hydrogeology; Porous Medium; Qualitative Analysis; Quantitative Analysis; Resource Scarcity; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Strategic Approach; Subsidence; Sustainability; Water Level; Water Management; Can Tho","Aquifers; Climate change; Groundwater resources; Porous materials; Salt water intrusion; Sea level; Subsidence; Water conservation; Water levels; Water management; Can tho; Deep wells; Ground water level; Land subsidence; Mann kendal test; Qualitative changes; Quantitative changes; Shallow wells; Spatio-temporal variation; Viet Nam; Hydrogeology; confined aquifer; groundwater; groundwater abstraction; groundwater resource; hydrogeology; porous medium; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; resource scarcity; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; subsidence; sustainability; water level; water management; Can Tho","","","This study is partially funded by the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14-P6 , supported by a Japanese ODA .

The outcome of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset has at least u defective items, negative if it has up to \ell defective items, where 0 \leq \ell < u , and arbitrary otherwise. This is called threshold group testing. The parameter g = u - \ell - 1 is called the gap. In this paper, we focus on the case g > 0 , i.e., threshold group testing with a gap. Note that the results presented here are also applicable to the case g = 0 ; however, the results are not as efficient as those in related work. Currently, a few reported studies have investigated test designs and decoding algorithms for identifying defective items. Most of the previous studies have not been feasible because there are numerous constraints on their problem settings or the decoding complexities of their proposed schemes are relatively large. Therefore, it is compulsory to reduce the number of tests as well as the decoding complexity, i.e., the time for identifying the defective items, for achieving practical schemes. The work presented here makes five contributions. The first is a more accurate theorem for a non-adaptive algorithm for threshold group testing proposed by Chen and Fu. The second is an improvement in the construction of disjunct matrices, which are the main tools for tackling (threshold) group testing and other tasks such as constructing cover-free families or learning hidden graphs. Specifically, we present a better exact upper bound on the number of tests for disjunct matrices compared with that in related work. The third and fourth contributions are a reduced exact upper bound on the number of tests and a reduced asymptotic bound on the decoding time for identifying defective items in a noisy setting on test outcomes. The fifth contribution is a simulation on the number of tests of the resulting improvements for previous work and the proposed theorems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithms; Combinatorial Mathematics; Non-adaptive Threshold Group Testing With A Gap; Sparse Recovery; Adaptive Algorithms; Decoding; Defects; Asymptotic Bounds; Cover-free Family; Decoding Algorithm; Decoding Complexity; Defective Items; Disjunct Matrices; Nonadaptive Algorithm; Practical Schemes; Matrix Algebra","Adaptive algorithms; Decoding; Defects; Asymptotic bounds; Cover-free family; Decoding algorithm; Decoding complexity; Defective items; Disjunct matrices; Nonadaptive algorithm; Practical schemes; Matrix algebra","","","","Bui, Thach V., Improved non-adaptive algorithms for threshold group testing with a gap, IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory - Proceedings, 2020-June, pp. 1414-1419, (2020); Ann Math Statist, (1943); Damaschke, Peter, Threshold group testing, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4123 LNCS, pp. 707-718, (2006); Chen, Hongbin, An upper bound of the number of tests in pooling designs for the error-tolerant complex model, Optimization Letters, 2, 3, pp. 425-431, (2008); Arxiv 1810 01086, (2018); Cheraghchi, Mahdi, Improved constructions for non-adaptive threshold group testing, Algorithmica, 67, 3, pp. 384-417, (2013); De Marco, Gianluca, Subquadratic non-adaptive threshold group testing, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 111, pp. 42-56, (2020); Chan, Chunlam, Stochastic threshold group testing, (2013); Chen, Hongbin, Nonadaptive algorithms for threshold group testing, Discrete Applied Mathematics, 157, 7, pp. 1581-1585, (2009); D'Yachkov, Arkadii G., Superimposed codes and threshold group testing, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7777, pp. 509-533, (2013)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15579654; 00189448","","IETTA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112527222"

The biodiversity provides a wide array of provision and cultural-ecological services to urban residents, but it is being overexploited to the point of crisis. The crisis is largely driven by the expanding illegal wildlife trade in developing countries with a high urbanization rate and biodiversity level like Vietnam. While supply-side measures are ineffective in reducing biodiversity loss, researchers have suggested demand-side measures as supplements, such as social marketing campaigns and law enforcement in urban areas. Moreover, urban residents are also potential visitors to urban public parks and national parks, which helps generate finance for biodiversity preservation and conservation in those places. Understanding how urban residents’ perceptions towards biodiversity and biodiversity-related behaviors can help improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts and sustainable urban development. Thus, this article presents a data set of 535 urban residents’ wildlife consumption behaviors, multifaceted perceptions and interactions with biodiversity-related concepts, and nature-based recreation demand. The data set is constructed with six major categories: 1) wildlife product consumption, 2) general biodiversity perceptions, 3) biodiversity at home and neighborhood, 4) public park visitation and motivations, 5) national park visitation and motivations, and 6) socio-demographic profiles. These resources are expected to support researchers in enriching the lax literature regarding the role of urban residents in biodiversity conservation and preservation, and help policymakers to find insights for building up an “eco-surplus culture” among urban residents through effective public communication and policymaking. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity Conservation; Urban Resident; Vietnam; Wildlife Trade; Animals; Biodiversity; Commerce; Developing Countries; Historic Preservation; Marketing; Motivation; Urban Growth; Biodiversity Conservation; Biodiversity Loss; Data Set; Ecological Services; National Parks; Public Parks; Supply Sides; Urban Resident; Viet Nam; Wildlife Trades; Conservation","Animals; Biodiversity; Commerce; Developing countries; Historic preservation; Marketing; Motivation; Urban growth; Biodiversity conservation; Biodiversity loss; Data set; Ecological services; National parks; Public parks; Supply sides; Urban resident; Viet Nam; Wildlife trades; Conservation","","","","Living Planet Report 2020; Natures Dangerous Decline Unprecedented Species Extinction Rates Accelerating; Indo Burma Biodiversity Hotspot; Vietnam Fifth National Report to the United Nations Convention on Biologival Diversity, (2014); Vietnam National Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 Vision to 2030, (2014); Shairp, Rachel, Understanding urban demand for wild meat in Vietnam: Implications for conservation actions, PLOS ONE, 11, 1, (2016); Challender, Daniel W.S., Poaching is more than an enforcement problem, Conservation Letters, 7, 5, pp. 484-494, (2014); Song, Nguyen Van, Wildlife trading in Vietnam: Situation, causes, and solutions, Journal of Environment and Development, 17, 2, pp. 145-165, (2008); Davis, Elizabeth Oneita, Consumer demand and traditional medicine prescription of bear products in Vietnam, Biological Conservation, 235, pp. 119-127, (2019); Davis, Elizabeth Oneita, An updated analysis of the consumption of tiger products in urban Vietnam, Global Ecology and Conservation, 22, (2020)","","MIT Press Journals","","","","","","2641435X; 20967004","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118219522"

The application of specific sewage markers to characterize contaminant sources is therefore essential for managing urban sanitation issues. In this study, we investigated the concentrations of eight sewage markers (acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, atenolol, and acesulfame) in various water sources within urban area of the Galle City, Sri Lanka. The total concentration of the eight markers was in the order of hospital discharge > sewage treatment plant (STP) influent > surface drainage system. Among the eight selected markers, acetaminophen was dominant in hospital discharge (70.2–123.6 µg/L) while caffeine was the largest contributor to STP influent (16.2–68.7 µg/L) and surface drainage (0.95–21.73 µg/L). We then proposed and tested a set of criteria for evaluating the applicability of markers, including removal efficiency, concentration magnitude, excretion rate, and wastewater burden. The labile markers caffeine and acetaminophen were suitable for characterizing domestic gray and black wastewater, respectively. These results imply that the city’s drainage system receives both domestic graywater and human excretion, likely due to insufficient on-site sanitation systems. The conservative marker carbamazepine was useful for tracking hospital residues over long distances; these results imply that hospital wastewater treatment was not working properly, accounting for pharmaceutical residues reaching surface water via a hidden discharges connected to the drainage system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetaminophen; Caffeine; Carbamazepine; Sewage Markers; Surface Water; Urban Sanitation; Caffeine; Developing Countries; Drainage; Hospitals; Organic Pollutants; Sanitation; Sewage Treatment; Sewage Treatment Plants; Surface Waters; Wastewater Treatment; Acetaminophen; Carbamazepine; Drainage Systems; Hospital Discharge; Plant Influents; Sewage Marker; Sewage-treatment Plants; Surface Drainage; Urban Sanitations; Water Drainage; Amides; Concentration (composition); Drainage Network; Drug; Sanitation; Sewage Treatment; Urban Area; Urbanization; Wastewater Treatment; Galle; Southern Province [sri Lanka]; Sri Lanka","Caffeine; Developing countries; Drainage; Hospitals; Organic pollutants; Sanitation; Sewage treatment; Sewage treatment plants; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Acetaminophen; Carbamazepine; Drainage systems; Hospital discharge; Plant influents; Sewage marker; Sewage-treatment plants; Surface drainage; Urban sanitations; Water drainage; Amides; concentration (composition); drainage network; drug; sanitation; sewage treatment; urban area; urbanization; wastewater treatment; Galle; Southern Province [Sri Lanka]; Sri Lanka","","","Funding: This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research JP20H04391.","World Urbanization Prospects the 2018 Revision, (2019); Progress on Drinking Water Sanitation and Hygiene 2017 Update and Sdg Baselines, (2025); Water Sanitation and Hygiene Wash Situation and Issues for Urban Poor People and Vulnerable Groups Cambodia, (2015); Freeman, Matthew Charles, The impact of sanitation on infectious disease and nutritional status: A systematic review and meta-analysis, International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health, 220, 6, pp. 928-949, (2017); Poor Inclusive Urban Sanitation an Overview, (2013); Lim, Fang Yee, Recent advances in the use of chemical markers for tracing wastewater contamination in aquatic environment: A review, Water (Switzerland), 9, 2, (2017); Kümmerer, Klaus, The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment due to human use - present knowledge and future challenges, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, 8, pp. 2354-2366, (2009); Boxall, Alistair B.A., Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: What are the big questions?, Environmental Health Perspectives, 120, 9, pp. 1221-1229, (2012); Simazaki, Dai, Occurrence of selected pharmaceuticals at drinking water purification plants in Japan and implications for human health, Water Research, 76, pp. 187-200, (2015); Schwab, Bradley W., Human pharmaceuticals in US surface waters: A human health risk assessment, Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, 42, 3, pp. 296-312, (2005)","","MDPI","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119303041"

However, few studies have attempted to clarify the constraints faced by farmers in implementing these new management practices. This study identified 10 constraints on implementing good management practices designed to improve the health and productivity of pig production, ensure the health of workers, reduce environmental pollution and allow customers to trace the origins of their products, collectively known as Good Animal Husbandry Practices. Low output price and lack of capital were identified as the key constraints faced by 42.8% and 28.3% of farmers, respectively. Furthermore, specialized production was found to mitigate these two constraints in terms of income contribution, whereas access to credit was found to exacerbate them. Lack of knowledge was the only constraint perceived to be more severe by non-VietGAHP farmers than by their VietGAHP counterparts. Based on the above results for both VietGAHP and non-VietGAHP farmers, these constraints need to be addressed by improving financial situations through formal credit and focusing on specialized pig-producing households. For the non-VietGAHP group, delivery of information on new management practices through the government extension services should be implemented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C21; Gahp; Good Animal Husbandry Practices Implementation; Household Pig Production; Lack Of Capital Constraint; Low Output Price Constraint; O33; Q12; Q16; Vietnam","","","","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from JSPS KAKENHI in 2019.

However, the association between wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> and mortality has not been well characterised. We aimed to comprehensively assess the association between short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> and mortality across various regions of the world. Methods: For this time series study, data on daily counts of deaths for all causes, cardiovascular causes, and respiratory causes were collected from 749 cities in 43 countries and regions during 2000–16. Daily concentrations of wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> were estimated using the three-dimensional chemical transport model GEOS-Chem at a 0·25° × 0·25° resolution. The association between wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> exposure and mortality was examined using a quasi-Poisson time series model in each city considering both the current-day and lag effects, and the effect estimates were then pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Based on these pooled effect estimates, the population attributable fraction and relative risk (RR) of annual mortality due to acute wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> exposure was calculated. Findings: 65·6 million all-cause deaths, 15·1 million cardiovascular deaths, and 6·8 million respiratory deaths were included in our analyses. The pooled RRs of mortality associated with each 10 μg/m3 increase in the 3-day moving average (lag 0–2 days) of wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> exposure were 1·019 (95% CI 1·016–1·022) for all-cause mortality, 1·017 (1·012–1·021) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1·019 (1·013–1·025) for respiratory mortality. Overall, 0·62% (95% CI 0·48–0·75) of all-cause deaths, 0·55% (0·43–0·67) of cardiovascular deaths, and 0·64% (0·50–0·78) of respiratory deaths were annually attributable to the acute impacts of wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> exposure during the study period. Interpretation: Short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM<inf>2·5</inf> was associated with increased risk of mortality. Urgent action is needed to reduce health risks from the increasing wildfires.

We used a water-balance model, involving the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool, to conduct a scenario-based evaluation of water demands. In doing so, we assessed the impacts of socio-economic development, such as population growth and climate change, on increasing water demand. The modelling results showed that the existing reservoirs—the main sources to recharge the groundwater (accounting for 56.92% in 2018 and 65.59% in 2030)—play a critical role in enhancing water supply resilience in the island, particularly during the dry season. In addition, future water shortages can be solved by investment in water supply infrastructures in combination with the use of alternative water sources, such as rainwater and desalinated seawater. The findings further indicate that while the local actors have a high awareness of the role of natural resources, they seem to neglect climate change. To meet the future water demands, we argue that upgrading and constructing new reservoirs, mobilizing resources for freshwater alternatives and investing in water supply facilities are among the most suitable roadmaps for the island. In addition, strengthening adaptive capacity, raising awareness and building professional capacity for both local people and officials are strongly recommended. The research concludes with a roadmap that envisages the integration of social capacity to address the complex interaction and co-evolution of the human–water system to foster water-supply resilience in the study area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Con Dao Island; Socio-hydrology; Water Resilience; Weap; Climate Change; Economics; Population Statistics; Recharging (underground Waters); Reservoirs (water); Tropics; Adaptive Capacity; Co-evolution; Con Dao Island; Local People; Socio-hydrology; Viet Nam; Water Demand; Water Evaluation And Planning; Water Resilience; Water System; Water Supply; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Desalination; Groundwater Resource; Hydrological Response; Population Growth; Recharge; Socioeconomic Impact; Water Planning; Water Stress; Water Supply; Con Dao Islands","Climate change; Economics; Population statistics; Recharging (underground waters); Reservoirs (water); Tropics; Adaptive capacity; Co-evolution; Con dao island; Local people; Socio-hydrology; Viet Nam; Water demand; Water evaluation and planning; Water resilience; Water system; Water supply; adaptive management; climate change; desalination; groundwater resource; hydrological response; population growth; recharge; socioeconomic impact; water planning; water stress; water supply; Con Dao Islands","","","Funding: This work is supported by Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) under the Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) with project reference number CRRP2019-01MY-Kumar.","Blair, Peter, Socio-hydrological modelling: A review asking ""why, what and how?, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 20, 1, pp. 443-478, (2016); Kumar, Pankaj Ravi, Numerical quantification of current status quo and future prediction of water quality in eight Asian megacities: challenges and opportunities for sustainable water management, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 191, 6, (2019); United Nations World Water Development Report 2017, (2017); Jalilov, Shokhrukh Mirzo, Sustainable urban water management: Application for integrated assessment in Southeast Asia, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 1, (2018); Peña-Ramos, José Antonio, Water conflicts in Central Asia: Some recommendations on the non-conflictual use of water, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 6, (2021); Kumar, Pankaj Ravi, Socio-hydrology: A key approach for adaptation to water scarcity and achieving human well-being in large riverine islands, Progress in Disaster Science, 8, (2020); Ingol-Blanco, Eusebio Mercedes, Development of a hydrological model for the Rio Conchos basin, Journal of Hydrologic Engineering - ASCE, 18, 3, pp. 340-351, (2013); Slaughter, Andrew Robert, Investigating possible climate change and development effects on water quality within an arid catchment in South Africa: A comparison of two models, 3, pp. 1568-1575, (2014); Yang, Liu, Water evaluation and planning (Weap) model application for exploring the water deficit at catchment level in beijing, Desalination and Water Treatment, 118, pp. 12-25, (2018); Sivapalan, Murugesu, Socio-hydrology: A new science of people and water, Hydrological Processes, 26, 8, pp. 1270-1276, (2012)","","MDPI","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115359976"

A series of batch adsorption experiments was carried out in single and binary‐metal solutions of Cd2+ and Pb2+ by changing the mixing proportions of SS and AAC grains. In addition, the effect of the liquid‐to‐solid ratio (L/S) on the removal of Cd2+ and Pb2+ in multi‐metal solution was examined. Results showed that SS grains had a high affinity with Cd2+ in the single solution, while AAC grains had an affinity with Pb2+. In the binary solution, the mixtures of SS and AAC grains removed both Cd2+ and Pb2+ well; especially, the tested adsorbents of SS+AAC [1:1] and SS+AAC [1:4] mixtures achieved approximately 100% removal of both metals. Based on the results in the multi‐metal solutions, the metal removal % and selectivity sequence varied depending on the mixed proportions of SS and AAC grains and L/S values. It was found that the SS+AAC [1:1] mixture of SS and AAC grains showed 100% removals of Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ simultaneously at L/S = 10 and 60. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (aac); Heavy Metals; Industrial By‐products; Metal Adsorption; Selectivity Sequence; Steel Slag (ss); Wastewater; Adsorption; Cation; Concentration (composition); Concrete; Detection Method; Experimental Study; Pollutant Removal; Slag; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment","adsorption; cation; concentration (composition); concrete; detection method; experimental study; pollutant removal; slag; wastewater; wastewater treatment","","","This research was funded by JST‐JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) Project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Petrella, Andrea, Heavy metals retention (Pb(II), Cd(II), Ni(II)) from single and multimetal solutions by natural biosorbents from the olive oil milling operations, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 114, pp. 79-90, (2018); Roshanfekr Rad, Leila Roshanfekr, Removal of Ni2+ and Cd2+ ions from aqueous solutions using electrospun PVA/zeolite nanofibrous adsorbent, Chemical Engineering Journal, 256, pp. 119-127, (2014); Sellaoui, Lotfi, Interpretation of single and competitive adsorption of cadmium and zinc on activated carbon using monolayer and exclusive extended monolayer models, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24, 24, pp. 19902-19908, (2017); Demey, Hary, A novel algal-based sorbent for heavy metal removal, Chemical Engineering Journal, 332, pp. 582-595, (2018); Singh, Om Vir, Phytoremediation: An overview of metallic ion decontamination from soil, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 61, 5-6, pp. 405-412, (2003); Duan, Qiannan, Distribution of Heavy Metal Pollution in Surface Soil Samples in China: A Graphical Review, Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 97, 3, pp. 303-309, (2016); Wu, Gang, A critical review on the bio-removal of hazardous heavy metals from contaminated soils: Issues, progress, eco-environmental concerns and opportunities, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 174, 1-3, pp. 1-8, (2010); Elouear, Zouhair, Removal of nickel and cadmium from aqueous solutions by sewage sludge ash: Study in single and binary systems, Environmental Technology (United Kingdom), 30, 6, pp. 561-570, (2009); Pourrut, Bertrand, Lead-induced DNA damage in Vicia faba root cells: Potential involvement of oxidative stress, Mutation Research - Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis, 726, 2, pp. 123-128, (2011); Fu, Fenglian, Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 92, 3, pp. 407-418, (2011)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115192540"

Basic information on seven CDW landfills under operation or closed/abandoned was collected, and the waste composition and the grain size distributions of dumped CDW at two landfills were investigated. Results showed that only one landfill site is currently under operation in Hanoi. Sanitary conditions of investigated landfills were relatively good without dumping of hazardous waste. Illegal dumping of domestic waste from residents, however, could be observed more or less at all sites due to an unclear boundary between dumping and surrounding areas. To improve current management of CDW landfills, a suitable recording system of accepted/dumped CDW and technical support for site managers are required as well as the implementation plan for developing and renovating landfills. Based on the results of the waste composition survey, the major components of dumped CDW were “Concrete”, “Clay bricks”, and “Soil-like”, and the sum of these materials reached >80% of the total. Grain size distributions of “Concrete” ranged from 10–600 mm and of “Clay bricks” ranged from 10–300 mm. Technical recommendations to examine a potential availability of dumped “Concrete” and “Clay bricks” as a base material in road construction are summarized from the viewpoints of segregation from “Soil-like” and impurities, grading of “Concrete” and “Clay bricks”, mechanical properties and environmental safety, and economic feasibility. The findings in this study raise challenges and perspectives to establish sound CDW management and to promote sustainable development of CDW recycling in Vietnam. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cdw Landfills; Construction And Demolition Waste (cdw); Grain Size Distribution; Hanoi; Vietnam; Waste Composition; Abandoned Land; Domestic Waste; Grain Size; Landfill; Recycling; Road Construction; Size Distribution; Sustainable Development; Hanoi; Viet Nam","abandoned land; domestic waste; grain size; landfill; recycling; road construction; size distribution; sustainable development; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This research was supported by JST–JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Pierrehumbert, Raymound T., There is no Plan B for dealing with the climate crisis, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 75, 5, pp. 215-221, (2019); Resource Efficiency; Villoria-Sáez, Paola, Estimation of construction and demolition waste, pp. 13-30, (2020); Huang, Beijia, Construction and demolition waste management in China through the 3R principle, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 129, pp. 36-44, (2018); National Waste Report 2018, (2018); Waste Statistics European Commission, (2018); Value Added by Economic Activity National Account Section, (2019); Designing with Vision A Technical Manual for Materials Choices in Sustainable Construction, (2000); Agamuthu, Pariatamby, Challenges in sustainable management of construction and demolition waste, Waste Management and Research, 26, 6, pp. 491-492, (2008); Hoang, Ngoc Han, A review of construction and demolition waste management in Southeast Asia, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 22, 2, pp. 315-325, (2020)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114898279"

This is a policy that has been found to constrain agricultural development in other countries. Although this restriction of land accumulation is now under review among policy decision makers, there is limited empirical evidence to assess the impacts of landholding on land productivity. To evaluate the impacts of land accumulation on both the technical and environmental performances of farms, this study employed latent class stochastic frontier analysis using data gathered through face-to-face interviews rice farmers in two Mekong Delta rice-producing regions: An Giang province and Can Tho city. We then used multiple linear regression and the ordered logit model to estimate impacts of land accumulation on these performances. The results suggest that land accumulation is more common in An Giang than in Can Tho, yet rice farmers were unable to consolidate separate parcels of rice production land to take advantage of economies of scale. We also found that land accumulation was also positively associated with both technical and environmental efficiencies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Efficiency; Land Accumulation; Ordered Logit Model; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Technical Efficiency; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Worker; Crop Production; Decision Making; Efficiency Measurement; Environmental Assessment; Land Management; Logit Analysis; Rice; Rural Landscape; Technical Efficiency; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","agricultural land; agricultural worker; crop production; decision making; efficiency measurement; environmental assessment; land management; logit analysis; rice; rural landscape; technical efficiency; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.01-2020.27 .

Although drink driving has received most of the scholarly attention, there is growing evidence of the risks of alcohol-impaired walking. Alcohol-impaired pedestrians are over-represented in fatal crashes compared to non-impaired pedestrians. Additionally, empirical evidence shows that alcohol intoxication impairs road-crossing judgements. Besides some limited early research, much is unknown about the global prevalence and determinants of alcohol-impaired walking. Understanding alcohol-impaired walking will support health promotion initiatives and injury prevention. The present investigation has three aims: (1) compare the prevalence of alcohol-impaired walking across countries; (2) identify international groups of pedestrians based on psychosocial factors (i.e., Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and perceptions of risk); and (3) investigate how segments of pedestrians form their intention for alcohol-impaired walking using the extended TPB (i.e. subjective norm, attitudes, perceived control, and perceived risk). A cross-sectional design was applied. The target behaviour question was “have you been a pedestrian when your thinking or physical ability (balance/strength) is affected by alcohol?” to ensure comparability across countries. Cluster analysis based on the extended TPB was used to identify groups of countries. Finally, regressions were used to predict pedestrians’ intentions per group. A total of 6,166 respondents (Age M(SD) = 29.4 (14.2); Males = 39.2%) completed the questionnaire, ranging from 12.6% from Russia to 2.2% from Finland. The proportion of participants who reported never engaging in alcohol-impaired walking in the last three months ranged from 30.1% (Spain) to 83.1% (Turkey). Four groups of countries were identified: group-1 (Czech Republic, Spain, and Australia), group-2 (Russia and Finland), group-3 (Japan), and group-4 (final ten countries including Colombia, China, and Romania). Pedestrian intentions to engage in alcohol- impaired walking are predicted by perceptions of risk and TPB-psychosocial factors in group-1 and group-4. Favourable TPB-beliefs and low perceived risk increased alcohol-impaired walking intentions. Conversely, subjective norms were not significant in group-2 and only perceived risk predicted intention in group-3. The willingness of pedestrians to walk when alcohol-impaired differs significantly across the countries in this study. Perceived risk was the only common predictor among the 16 countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Travel; Alcohol; Multi-country Study; Substance Use; Theory Of Planned Behaviour; Vulnerable Road Users; Behavior; Cross-sectional Study; High Risk Behavior; Human; Male; Pedestrian; Questionnaire; Traffic Accident; Walking; Accidents, Traffic; Cross-sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; Male; Pedestrians; Risk-taking; Surveys And Questionnaires; Walking","behavior; cross-sectional study; high risk behavior; human; male; pedestrian; questionnaire; traffic accident; walking; Accidents, Traffic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; Male; Pedestrians; Risk-Taking; Surveys and Questionnaires; Walking","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q) at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) for supporting the present research through an internal grant.

However, Vietnamese rice farmers face several challenges, including pressures to develop sustainable livelihoods while reducing the environmental impacts of their production activities. Various Vietnamese agricultural restructuring policies were promulgated to promote the adoption of environmentally friendly practices to generate high value added for rice farmers, but the farmers are reluctant to adopt them because of perceived lack of demand. Decreasing consumption of rice in Asia and increasing demands in Europe shaped Vietnamese rice exporting policies. New trade agreements, such as the UK–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, offer new target markets for Vietnamese rice farmers. This research provides empirical evidence related to the preferences of UK consumers for ethical attributes for floating rice imported from Vietnam. Floating rice represents a traditional method of rice cultivation that relies on the natural flooding cycle. Its cultivation uses very few agrochemical inputs and provides several other environmental, economic, and social benefits. In an online survey, the study used a choice experiment that asked 306 UK consumers to report their preferences for one kilo of floating rice with three non-market attributes: Reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, allocation of profits to the farmers, and restitution of biodiversity. Overall, study participants favored the attributes of floating rice, but reported utility for only the “fair trade” attribute and for a marginal willingness to pay premiums for profit allocations to farmers. Consumers did not find value in either CO2 emission reduction or biodiversity improvement. Results from the study provide recommendations to develop agricultural programs, distribution strategies, and informational methods to encourage floating rice consumption in the UK. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Policy; Agriculture In International Trade; Biodiversity; Carbon Footprint; Fair Trade; Food Policy; Government Policy; Greenhouse Gas Reduction; Valuation Of Environmental Effects; Value Chain Agri-food; Agrochemical; Alternative Agriculture; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Cultivation; Ethics; Food Consumption; Food Market; Food Security; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; Willingness To Pay; Asia; Europe; United Kingdom; Viet Nam","agrochemical; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; carbon dioxide; cultivation; ethics; food consumption; food market; food security; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; willingness to pay; Asia; Europe; United Kingdom; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This study was funded by RONPAKU, JSPS (ID number R11616), The Konosuke Matsushita Memorial Foundation (ID number 17-056), and by a grant from the Global Engagement Office of Sam M.

On the other hand, soup rich in umami substances (dashi) was reported to reduce indexes of anxiety and stress. The objective of this study was to measure mood and physiological stress indexes during administration of a sodium-restricted diet with and without an umami substance (free L-glutamate) by a cross-over randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Japanese female university students. The baseline was measured for 5 days followed by a sodium-restricted diet intervention phase that lasted for 10 days. The Profile of Mood States questionnaire was administered, a stress marker in saliva (chromogranin-A) was measured, and the amount of sodium intake was confirmed from 24 h urine collection samples. Results showed that the sodium reduction was verified by 24 h urine excretion. The percentage of change in the stress marker from the baseline showed that the stress level in group without the umami substance was significantly higher than that in the group with the umami substance (p = 0.013) after receiving a sodium-reduced diet for 6 or more days, indicating that stress was alleviated. This study suggested that umami substances might help to ameliorate stress during a sodium-reduced diet, especially in the initial phase. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-over; Restricted Sodium Diet; Stress; Umami Substances","","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by Ajinomoto Co., Inc.; Funding text 2: The authors gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of all participants.

The English version of CESD-R was translated into Japanese, and back-translated into English by three native speakers of Japanese and English; then, we selected the version most completely consistent with the original items. The CESD-R was applied to 398 community-dwelling people (191 men: 48.0%, and 207 women: 52.0%) who were over 40 years old. The Japanese version of the CES-D was also carried out in the same population. Factor analysis was performed. Additionally, the correlations between the CESD-R and CES-D results were identified. The CESD-R scores showed a significantly positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.74, p < 0.0005). Analysis of the CESD-R yielded a Cronbach’s alpha result of 0.90. Factor analysis revealed one principal factor in the CESD-R, whereas the original CES-D had two factors because of reversed items. The Japanese version of the CESD-R appears to have the reliability to be applicable for assessing depressive symptoms in population-based samples. However, because the Japanese expressions for some items might be unusual, our study population was also limited; further studies on other populations and on incorporating improved Japanese terminology will be needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ces-d; Cesd-r; Depressive Symptoms; Epidemiological Study; Japanese Version","","","","","Vos, Theo, Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, The Lancet, 388, 10053, pp. 1545-1602, (2016); Kessler, Ronald C., The epidemiology of depression across cultures, Annual Review of Public Health, 34, pp. 119-138, (2013); Jpn J Psychiatr Treat, (2019); Lehti, Arja Helena, Recognition of depression in people of different cultures: A qualitative study, BMC Family Practice, 10, (2009); Tsuboi, Hirohito, Possible connections among job stress, depressive symptoms, lipid modulation and antioxidants, Journal of Affective Disorders, 91, 1, pp. 63-70, (2006); Steer, Robert A., Further evidence for the construct validity of the Beck Depression Inventory-II with psychiatric outpatients, Psychological Reports, 80, 2, pp. 443-446, (1997); Steptoe, Andrew, Depressive symptoms, socio-economic background, sense of control, and cultural factors in university students from 23 countries, International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 14, 2, pp. 97-107, (2007); Cuijpers, Pim, Is excess mortality higher in depressed men than in depressed women?

Data were collected from 909 employees in Singapore, Thailand and Japan. Results of the study show that there is a positive relationship between several i-deals and affective commitment. However, the effect size of i-deals on each dimension varies across the three countries. In particular, the effect size of task and work responsibilities i-deals on the affective commitment of Japanese employees is stronger than that of Thai employees. Simultaneously, the effect size of the i-deals on affective commitment of Singaporean employees is weaker than that of Thai employees. On the contrary, for the dimensions of schedule and location flexibility and financial incentives, the effect size of i-deals on affective commitment is weaker for Singaporean than for Japanese and Thai, and the effect sizes for Japanese and Thai are the same. The results of this study question the traditionally and universally naive conclusion that i-deals are effective. Although i-deals result in, to some extent, some positive consequences, the results of the study suggest that not in all cases do they increase employee affective commitment. Empirical evidence of the study also demonstrate that the effects i-deals had on employee affective commitment are inconsistent even across cultures with close cultural origin. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comparative Analysis; Idiosyncratic Deals; Japan; Singapore; Thailand","","","","","Adams, J.

We report a survey conducted across 41 societies between March and May 2020 (N = 34,526), and test pre-registered hypotheses about how cross-societal differences in cooperation and trust relate to prosocial COVID-19 responses (e.g., social distancing), stringency of policies, and support for behavioral regulations (e.g., mandatory quarantine). We further tested whether cross-societal variation in institutions and ecologies theorized to impact cooperation were associated with prosocial COVID-19 responses, including institutional quality, religiosity, and historical prevalence of pathogens. We found substantial variation across societies in prosocial COVID-19 responses, stringency of policies, and support for behavioral regulations. However, we found no consistent evidence to support the idea that cross-societal variation in cooperation and trust among strangers is associated with these outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results were replicated with another independent cross-cultural COVID-19 dataset (N = 112,136), and in both snowball and representative samples. We discuss implications of our results, including challenging the assumption that managing the COVID-19 pandemic across societies is best modeled as a public goods dilemma. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cooperation; Covid-19; Culture; Institutions; Social Dilemmas; Trust","","","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75-71015), the University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (COV20/00086).

Interpretations are represented by vectors and programs are represented by matrices. The least model of a definite program is computed by multiplying an interpretation vector and a program matrix. To optimize computation in vector spaces, we provide a method of partial evaluation of programs using linear algebra. Partial evaluation is done by unfolding rules in a program, and it is realized in a vector space by multiplying program matrices. We perform experiments using artificial data and real data, and show that partial evaluation has the potential for realizing efficient computation of huge scale of programs in vector spaces. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Linear Algebra; Logic Programming; Optimization; Partial Evaluation; Vector Spaces; Computer Circuits; Formal Logic; Logic Programming; Matrix Algebra; Vectors; Artificial Data; Efficient Computation; Partial Evaluation; Propositional Logic; Reasoning Methods; Vector Spaces","Computer circuits; Formal logic; Logic programming; Matrix algebra; Vectors; Artificial data; Efficient computation; Partial evaluation; Propositional logic; Reasoning methods; Vector spaces","","","","Alferes, José Júlio, Dynamic updates of non-monotonic knowledge bases, Journal of Logic Programming, 45, 1, pp. 43-70, (2000); Aspis, Yaniv, Tensor-based abduction in horn propositional programs, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2206, pp. 68-75, (2018); Aspis, Yaniv, Stable and supported semantics in continuous vector spaces, 1, pp. 58-67, (2020); Brewka, Gerhard, Answer set programming at a glance, Communications of the ACM, 54, 12, pp. 93-103, (2011); Dowling, William F., Linear-time algorithms for testing the satisfiability of propositional horn formulae, Journal of Logic Programming, 1, 3, pp. 267-284, (1984); Gallaire, Hervé, Logic and Databases: A Deductive Approach, ACM Computing Surveys, 16, 2, pp. 153-185, (1984); Grefenstette, Edward, Towards a Formal Distributional Semantics: Simulating Logical Calculi with Tensors, 1, pp. 1-10, (2013); From Satisfiability to Linear Algebra, (2013); Lloyd, John W., Partial evaluation in logic programming, Journal of Logic Programming, 11, 3-4, pp. 217-242, (1991); Leone, Nicola, The DLV system for knowledge representation and reasoning, ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, 7, 3, pp. 499-562, (2006)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","0955792X; 1465363X","","JLCOE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112528984"

The increase in food waste has serious negative impacts on environmental sustainability, water and land resources, and food security, as well as climate and greenhouse gas emissions. Through a specific case study in Da Nang City, Vietnam, this paper examines the extent of food waste generation at the consumption stages, the eating habits of consumers, food waste from households and service establishments, as well as prospects for the reuse of food waste as pig feed. The results of this study indicate that per capita food waste generation in Da Nang has increased from 0.39 to 0.41kg in 2016, 0.46 in 2017, and reached 0.52kg in 2018. According to the results of our consumer survey, 20% of respondents stated that they often generate food waste, 67% stated they sometimes do, and 13% stated they rarely do. Furthermore, 66% of surveyed households stated that their food waste is collected and transported by pig farmers to be used as feed for pigs. The use of food waste as feed for pigs is a typical feature in Da Nang. The study also found that there is a high level of consumer awareness and willingness to participate in the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) program, which was being initiated by the city government. In service facilities such as resorts and hotels, daily food waste reached 100–200 kg in large facilities and 20–120 kg in small facilities. This waste was also collected for use in pig farming. However, there has been a fall in demand for pig feed in line with a decrease in the number of pig farms due to the African swine fever epidemic that occurred during the implementation of this study. This paper suggests that there is a strong need to take both consumer-oriented waste prevention and waste management measures, such as waste segregation at source and introduction of effective food waste recycling techniques, to ensure that food waste can be safely and sustainably used as a “valuable resource” rather than “wasted.”. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3rs Program; Landscape Sustainability; Municipal Solid Waste; Pig Farming; Resource Circulation; Resource Use Efficiency; Urban–rural Nexus; Zero-waste Lifestyle; Consumption Behavior; Environmental Impact; Food Security; Food Waste; Greenhouse Gas; Megacity; Recycling; Resource Use; Sustainability; Waste Management; Da Nang; Viet Nam","consumption behavior; environmental impact; food security; food waste; greenhouse gas; megacity; recycling; resource use; sustainability; waste management; Da Nang; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) under the Strategic Research Fund 2019?2020; and supported by the Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund (S16) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan under the project entitled: ?Policy Design and Evaluation to Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns in Asian Region?

We aimed to evaluate the global, regional, and national mortality burden associated with non-optimal ambient temperatures. Methods: In this modelling study, we collected time-series data on mortality and ambient temperatures from 750 locations in 43 countries and five meta-predictors at a grid size of 0·5° × 0·5° across the globe. A three-stage analysis strategy was used. First, the temperature–mortality association was fitted for each location by use of a time-series regression. Second, a multivariate meta-regression model was built between location-specific estimates and meta-predictors. Finally, the grid-specific temperature–mortality association between 2000 and 2019 was predicted by use of the fitted meta-regression and the grid-specific meta-predictors. Excess deaths due to non-optimal temperatures, the ratio between annual excess deaths and all deaths of a year (the excess death ratio), and the death rate per 100 000 residents were then calculated for each grid across the world. Grids were divided according to regional groupings of the UN Statistics Division. Findings: Globally, 5 083 173 deaths (95% empirical CI [eCI] 4 087 967–5 965 520) were associated with non-optimal temperatures per year, accounting for 9·43% (95% eCI 7·58–11·07) of all deaths (8·52% [6·19–10·47] were cold-related and 0·91% [0·56–1·36] were heat-related). There were 74 temperature-related excess deaths per 100 000 residents (95% eCI 60–87). The mortality burden varied geographically. Of all excess deaths, 2 617 322 (51·49%) occurred in Asia. Eastern Europe had the highest heat-related excess death rate and Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest cold-related excess death rate. From 2000–03 to 2016–19, the global cold-related excess death ratio changed by −0·51 percentage points (95% eCI −0·61 to −0·42) and the global heat-related excess death ratio increased by 0·21 percentage points (0·13–0·31), leading to a net reduction in the overall ratio. The largest decline in overall excess death ratio occurred in South-eastern Asia, whereas excess death ratio fluctuated in Southern Asia and Europe. Interpretation: Non-optimal temperatures are associated with a substantial mortality burden, which varies spatiotemporally. Our findings will benefit international, national, and local communities in developing preparedness and prevention strategies to reduce weather-related impacts immediately and under climate change scenarios.

Rapid recovery is meaningful because delays increase social costs and deepen and prolong economic and social pain. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated the post-flood recovery speed in association with household characteristics and social connections and identified the contribution of these actors in different recovery sub-phases. Four flood-prone villages in Quang Dien district, Thua Thien Hue Province, central Vietnam, were selected for this case study. The multiple linear regression model (OLS) determining the post-flood recovery speed first indicated the ineffectiveness of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including age, educational qualifications, number of laborers, non-farm jobs, and income level. Social connection, meanwhile, appeared as a crucial factor accelerating households' rehabilitation. Accordingly, connections with relatives and informal groups were more valuable than those with friends, neighbors, and formal groups. The subdivision of the recovery process further reveals the variation in the role of connections in different recovery sub-phases. The key role of relatives and neighbors was highlighted through their striking support in almost all categories, both in the immediate post-flood and in the short-term phase. Though fairly modest in the early stage, support from friends, formal groups, informal groups, and local government, tended to increase in the short-term (especially for informal groups and local governments). The long-term recovery phase witnessed significant contributions from local government through financial and career-related support. Besides stressing the vital role of social connection in accelerating post-flood recovery, these findings pointed out their dynamics in the recovery sub-phases that should be integrated into the post-flood rehabilitation policy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Flood; Natural Hazards; Post-flood Recovery; Social Capitals; Social Connections","","","","The rehabilitation process began shortly after the floodwater receded. Support related to emotions, shelter, supplies, information, and cleanup were the most common during the first days after the flood ( Fig. 4 ). Debris cleaning is the most popular help since it was received by nearly half of the respondents (48.78%), followed by emotions, supplies, and information (about 40%), and shelters (14.63%). The roles of relatives and neighbors were underscored in this stage; they provided the most support in almost all categories. Mental support, although non-financial, is extremely important, especially for those who experienced severe damage. Households reported that emotional support is indispensable for them to overcome flood-induced stress. Almost 40% of households received this type of support from neighbors, while over 20% were obtained from relatives. Similarly, 32% and 39% of households were supported by neighbors and relatives in cleaning up deposits and debris, respectively. For most households, cleaning mud deposits took place immediately after the floodwater had receded. This work is much easier with a water layer on the floor. This type of help is often directed towards solitary or labor-scarce households. In addition, providing temporary shelters was also mainly done by neighbors at about 10%. In contrast, the contribution of the local government in this emergency time was only reflected through supports related to information and necessities. The authorities provided urgent necessities to 25% and information to 31% of households. Most of them are poverty-stricken or harshly damaged households. Supports from friends and formal groups were negligible during this period.","Climate Change 2014 Mitigation of Climate Change, (2014); Natural Disasters 2018, (2019); Building Resilience Social Capital in Post Disaster Recovery, (2012); Nguyen Duc, Kien, Evidence of climatic change in Vietnam: Some implications for agricultural production, Journal of Environmental Management, 231, pp. 524-545, (2019); Global Climate Risk Index 2014, (2013); Worlds 15 Countries with the Most People Exposed to River Floods, (2015); Nat Hazards Earth Syst Sci Discuss, (2017); undefined, (2013); Weathering the Storm Options for Disaster Risk Financing in Vietnam, (2010); Chan, N.

Objectives: To identify the individual and organizational impacts of a clinical training system and the mechanism that produces them by exploring nurses' perceptions of the changes in health facilities after the introduction of a standardized clinical training system in Vietnam. Design: Qualitative research using an ethnographic approach; photovoice was used to obtain insights into nurses' perceptions. Setting: Health facilities of four provinces and one city in Vietnam participated in the Project for Strengthening of the Clinical Training System for New Graduate Nurses. Participants: New graduate nurses, preceptors, and managers who engaged in the clinical training program. Methods: Qualitative data, including photographs, were collected through photovoice sessions and inductively analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Sixteen photovoice sessions were conducted with 94 nurses from 22 hospitals. Three themes emerged: “acquiring competency” as an individual change, “fostering mutual learning culture” as an organizational change, and “improved quality of care and nurse empowerment” as the impact. The clinical training system was found to enhance diverse competencies of new graduate nurses, preceptors, and nurse managers, while facilitating collaboration among different professions, departments, and organizations and cultivating a better learning environment. Organizational changes were initiated with the hospital director's support. These changes were interactively related and produced the impact. Conclusions: The novel clinical training system for new graduate nurses could strengthen nurses' competencies and facilitate organizational changes to actualize a positive impact on nursing care and nurses' status. These findings could facilitate the design of an effective training program to stimulate organizational learning to produce better health outcome. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Competence; Intersectoral Collaboration; Nursing Education; Organization And Administration; Organizational Culture; Staff Development; Human; Nurse Administrator; Nursing Education; Organization; Perception; Qualitative Research; Viet Nam; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Humans; Nurse Administrators; Organizational Innovation; Perception; Qualitative Research; Vietnam","human; nurse administrator; nursing education; organization; perception; qualitative research; Viet Nam; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Humans; Nurse Administrators; Organizational Innovation; Perception; Qualitative Research; Vietnam","","","This study was funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Project for Strengthening Clinical Training System for New-Graduate Nurses, Vietnam.

The generated point clouds are corrected by applying bias correction and the 7 parameters transformation. The result is validated using three different experimental setups with three various flight height which indicate that the most accurate and reliable results are obtained. As a result, the point clouds after calibrating attained an accuracy of approximate 0.2 m in vertical and horizontal for both correction methods.

BCE) community in northern Vietnam. Drawing on a wealth of work over the past 15 years, we examine identity with respect to three fundamental classes of data: intrinsic biological variables (age-at-death, sex, kin group, biological ancestry), mortuary treatment, and body modification (patterned tooth removal, or ablation). We find that kin groups, biologically and affinally defined, likely played a substantive structuring role at Man Bac. Moreover, a political tension between genetically and phenotypically distinct groups inhabiting Man Bac appears to be visible in the mortuary record. Social organization aside, shells appear to have had a significant role in referencing cosmological and gendered aspects of identity. Nephrite, with regard to some artefact types, would appear to cite magico-religious and/or elite status components of identity. While unique items, such as a ceramic copy of a barrel drum, may have spoken to exchanges of shamanistic beliefs between northern Vietnam and what is now southern China. Identity at Man Bac would appear to have been complex, fluid, negotiable, and ever changing; or just what one might expect. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Body Modification; Ceramic Drums; Funerary Archaeology; Kinship; Nephrite Ornaments; Shell Objects","","","","This research was supported by JSPS fund 16H02527 and Australian Research Council grant DP0774079 .","Alqahtani, Sakher J., Brief communication: The London atlas of human tooth development and eruption, American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 142, 3, pp. 481-490, (2010); Handbook of Archaeological Theories, (2025); Appleby, Jo E.P., Why we need an archaeology of old age, and a suggested approach, Norwegian Archaeological Review, 43, 2, pp. 145-168, (2010); Appleby, Jo E.P., Bodies, burials and ageing: Accessing the temporality of old age in prehistoric societies, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, 30, 3, pp. 231-246, (2011); Uncovering Southeast Asia S Past Selected Papers from the 10th International Conference of the European Association of Southeast Asian Archaeologists, (2006); Archaeology and Women, (2007); Bellwood, Peter S., An son and the neolithic of Southern Vietnam, Asian Perspectives, 50, 1-2, pp. 144-175, (2011); Bentley, R.

The binary logit model was applied to analyze data collected by face-to-face interviews with 110 households in Phu Vang Coastal District, Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The findings indicate that most farmers accurately perceived climate-related changes during the recent decade, and implemented various adaptation measures in an effort to alleviate the potential risks. Adaptations included changing crop varieties, adjusting farming calendar, diversifying crops, diversifying livestock, improving irrigation, and intensifying soil quality. In addition, the farming household adaptation decisions were positively affected by gender, education level, number of laborers, income level, involvement in local community organizations, and perception of climate change severity and adaptation measure efficacy. Farmer adaptations, in contrast, were negatively influenced by non-farm income and entirely unaffected by access to credit. Policy-related recommendations were proposed to encourage smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change in the region. Recommendations included (1) improvements in the understanding of climate change, especially for female and less educated farmers; (2) more attention paid to the activities of local community organizations to be more attractive for members; (3) participation in the non-agricultural sector in parallel with implementing climate change adaptation measures in agriculture; (4) preferential loans designed as targets for low-income households combined with strict management to avoid misuse by beneficiaries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation Decision; Central Vietnam; Climate Change; Phu Vang District; Smallholder Farmers","","","","","Al-amin, Abul Quasem, Analysing the socioeconomic and motivational factors affecting the willingness to pay for climate change adaptation in Malaysia, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 50, (2020); Alam, GM Monirul, Climate change perceptions and local adaptation strategies of hazard-prone rural households in Bangladesh, Climate Risk Management, 17, pp. 52-63, (2017); Arora-Jonsson, Seema, Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change, Global Environmental Change, 21, 2, pp. 744-751, (2011); Asrat, Paulos, Farmers’ perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in the Dabus watershed, North-West Ethiopia, Ecological Processes, 7, 1, (2018); Bakhsh, Khuda, Adaptation to climate change in rain-fed farming system in Punjab, Pakistan, International Journal of the Commons, 13, 2, pp. 833-847, (2019); Bankoff, Greg, A history of poverty: The politics of natural disasters in the Philippines, 1985–95, Pacific Review, 12, 3, pp. 381-420, (1999); Framework for Integrated Water Management in the Thua Thien Hue Province Delft University of Technology, (2014); Agriculture and Development Discussion Paper Series 2017 3, (2023); Bryan, Elizabeth, Adaptation to climate change in Ethiopia and South Africa: options and constraints, Environmental Science and Policy, 12, 4, pp. 413-426, (2009); Coumou, Dim, A decade of weather extremes, Nature Climate Change, 2, 7, pp. 491-496, (2012)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","25097954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100032246"

It identifies factors associated with self-reported NCDs and examines socio-economic-related health inequality in self-reported NCDs between rural and urban Vietnamese older people. This cross-sectional study utilised data from the Viet Nam Ageing Survey. A sample of 2,682 older people aged 60 and over (urban = 703, rural = 1,979) was analysed. Concentration indices were computed to measure socio-economic inequalities in self-reported NCDs. Concentration index decomposition analysis was performed to determine the relative contributions of the determinants to explaining those inequalities. Significant socio-economic inequalities in self-reported NCDs favouring the rich were found, in which the degree of inequality was more pronounced in urban areas than in their rural counterparts. Household wealth and social health insurance were the main drivers contributing to increased socio-economic inequalities in self-reported NCDs in urban and rural areas, respectively. Among disadvantaged groups, older people living alone, with lowest wealth and with social health insurance had highest probability of reporting at least one NCD for both areas. Public policies aimed at narrowing wealth gaps and expanding and improving principle roles of social health insurance should prioritise the most disadvantaged groups in order to achieve health equality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ageing; Concentration Index; Decomposition Analysis; Developing Countries; Non-communicable Diseases; Viet Nam; Aging; Concentration (composition); Decomposition Analysis; Developing World; Elderly Population; Health Care; Noncommunicable Disease; Socioeconomic Status; Viet Nam","aging; concentration (composition); decomposition analysis; developing world; elderly population; health care; noncommunicable disease; socioeconomic status; Viet Nam","","","","Basu, Sanjay Y., Disability and chronic disease among older adults in India: Detecting vulnerable populations through the WHO SAGE Study, American Journal of Epidemiology, 178, 11, pp. 1620-1628, (2013); Chantzaras, Athanasios E., Income-related health inequalities among the migrant and native-born populations in Greece during the economic crisis: A decomposition analysis, European Journal of Public Health, 28, pp. 24-31, (2018); Dos Santos Costa, Caroline, Inequalities in multimorbidity among elderly: A population-based study in a city in Southern Brazil, Cadernos de Saude Publica, 34, 11, (2018); Costa-Font, Joan I., Income inequalities in unhealthy life styles in England and Spain, Economics and Human Biology, 13, 1, pp. 66-75, (2014); Social Welfare Policies and the Development of Social Services for the Elderly Under Socialist Oriented Market Economy, (2010); Erreygers, Guido E., Correcting the Concentration Index, Journal of Health Economics, 28, 2, pp. 504-515, (2009); Erreygers, Guido E., Measuring socioeconomic inequality in health, health care and health financing by means of rank-dependent indices: A recipe for good practice, Journal of Health Economics, 30, 4, pp. 685-694, (2011); Population Projections for Vietnam 2014 2049, (2016); Journal of Economics Development, (2016); Economic Studies, (2017)","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","0144686X; 14691779","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078259029"

Statistical indicators and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model are employed to investigate the hydrological performances of the GMPs against the data of 17 rain gauges distributed across the CRB. The results show that there are strong correlations between the temperature reanalysis products in both CMADS and CFSR and those obtained from the ground-based observations (the correlation coefficients range from 0.92 to 0.97). The CFSR data overestimate precipitation (percentage bias approximately 99%) at both daily and monthly scales, whereas the CMADS product performs better, with obvious differences (compared to the ground-based observations) in high-terrain areas. Regarding the simulated river flows, CFSR-SWAT produced “unsatisfactory”, while CMADS-SWAT (R2 > 0.76 and NSE > 0.78) performs better than CFSR-SWAT on the monthly scale. This assessment of the applicative potential of GMPs, espe-cially CMADS, may further provide an additional rapid alternative for water resource research and management in basins with similar hydro-meteorological conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cau River Basin; Cfsr; Cmads; Extreme Weather Event; Gmp; Reanalysis Data; Swat Model; Tropical Monsoon; Climate Models; Rain Gages; Temperature Measurement; Tropics; Watersheds; Correlation Coefficient; Ground-based Observations; Meteorological Condition; Meteorological Products; Meteorological Station; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Statistical Indicators; Strong Correlation; Rivers; Data Assimilation; Ground-based Measurement; Hydrological Change; Monsoon; Prediction; Raingauge; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Tropical Environment; Weather Forecasting; Cau Basin; Viet Nam","Climate models; Rain gages; Temperature measurement; Tropics; Watersheds; Correlation coefficient; Ground-based observations; Meteorological condition; Meteorological products; Meteorological station; Soil and water assessment tool; Statistical indicators; Strong correlation; Rivers; data assimilation; ground-based measurement; hydrological change; monsoon; prediction; raingauge; soil and water assessment tool; tropical environment; weather forecasting; Cau Basin; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFC1506506), the Frontier Project of the Applied Foundation of Wuhan (2019020701011502), the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province (20201BBG71002), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2019CFB736), the LIESMARS Special Research Funding, and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research under project reference number CRRP2020-09MY-Kantoush.","Aghakouchak, Amir, Evaluation of satellite-retrieved extreme precipitation rates across the central United States, Journal of Geophysical Research, 116, 2, (2011); Lu, Jianzhong, Assessment of CFSR and CMADS Weather Data for Capturing Extreme Hydrologic Events in the Fuhe River Basin of the Poyang Lake, Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 56, 5, pp. 917-934, (2020); Zhang, Ling, Stream flow simulation and verification in ungauged zones by coupling hydrological and hydrodynamic models: A case study of the Poyang Lake ungauged zone, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 21, 11, pp. 5847-5861, (2017); Tan, Mou Leong, Assessment of three long-term gridded climate products for hydro-climatic simulations in tropical river basins, Water (Switzerland), 9, 3, (2017); Lu, Jianzhong, Evaluation of hydrological response to extreme climate variability using SWAT model: Application to the Fuhe basin of Poyang Lake Watershed, China, Hydrology Research, 48, 6, pp. 1730-1744, (2017); Steiner, Matthias, Comparison of two methods for estimating the sampling-related uncertainty of satellite rainfall averages based on a large radar dataset, Journal of Climate, 16, 22, pp. 3759-3778, (2003); Yilmaz, Koray K., Intercomparison of rain gauge, radar, and satellite-based precipitation estimates with emphasis on hydrologic forecasting, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 6, 4, pp. 497-517, (2005); Dang, Dinh Kha, Evaluation of grid-based rainfall products and water balances over the Mekong river Basin, Remote Sensing, 12, 11, (2020); Tian, Yudong, Evaluation of GSMaP precipitation estimates over the contiguous United States, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 11, 2, pp. 566-574, (2010); Anagnostou, M.

Previous studies examining nasalance have been mainly conducted with Indo-European languages. Limited information on nasalance is available in tone languages other than Chinese. Furthermore, tone and vowel effects on nasalance scores in tone languages have not been fully examined. Method: Nasalance scores of various speech stimuli including passages, syllables, and prolonged vowels were obtained from Vietnamese-speaking adults with Southern dialect (M<inf>age</inf> = 23 years) using a nasometer (KayPENTAX 6450). Results: The average nasalance scores of Southern Vietnamese adult speakers were 24.16%, 38.17%, and 70.03% for the oral, oral–nasal, and nasal passages, respectively. Southern Vietnamese speakers produced the highest nasalance scores on the vowel /a/, followed by /i/ and /u/. Nasalance scores of stimuli produced with the falling and restricted tone were significantly lower than those produced with the other tones. Conclusions: The normative nasalance values of the current study will contribute as a reference index for the Vietnamese language. The effects of vowels and tones can also provide insight into the development of nasalance testing stimuli and for characterizing nasalance values across languages. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Female; Human; Human Experiment; Male; Nasalance; Speech; Vietnamese; Vowel; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Language; Speech Analysis; Voice; Young Adult; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Humans; Language; Speech Acoustics; Speech Production Measurement; Voice Quality; Young Adult","adult; article; female; human; human experiment; male; nasalance; speech; Vietnamese; vowel; Asian continental ancestry group; language; speech analysis; voice; young adult; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Humans; Language; Speech Acoustics; Speech Production Measurement; Voice Quality; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by Japanese Cleft Palate Foundation Grant 455-460, awarded to Duc Minh Nguyen.

In this study, we derive a multivariable lookup table function for estimating flood damages to rice crops based on a secondary research approach, which involves collecting and integrating fragmented secondary information sources of rice damage caused by inundation and event data observed in southern rural areas of the Ca River Basin, Central Vietnam. The derived lookup table function includes the effects of the rice growth stages on the damage caused, in addition to flooding parameters such as inundation level and inundation duration. This indicates that the rice crops are generally the most vulnerable and robust to inundation in the ripening and the reproductive stages. The yield loss in the ripening stage dramatically increases from 50% to 90% when the complete inundation lasts 5–8 days. Even after 7 days of 75% inundation, the yield hardly decreased at the reproductive stage and was reduced by almost half for 7 days of complete inundation. Four–five days of complete inundation at the ripening and vegetation stages are likely to cause almost the same damage to rice crops as that caused by 7 days of inundation at the reproductive stage. Utilization of the function to estimate rice damage in four flood events reveals that the derived multivariable function captures flood damages well and outperforms the univariable damage functions for the target area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flood Damage Function; Growth Stages; Inundation Duration; Inundation Level; Multivariable Lookup Table; Rice Crop","","","","","Flood Risk Management Hazards Vulnerability and Mitigation Measures, (2006); Evaluating Flood Damages Guidance and Recommendations on Principles and Methods, (2007); Merz, Bruno, Review article ""assessment of economic flood damage, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 10, 8, pp. 1697-1724, (2010); Natural Hazards Direct Costs and Losses Due to the Disruption of Production Processes, (2011); Penning-Rowsell, Edmund C., The benefits of flood alleviation.

Vulnerability to food poverty constitutes a certain probability that a non-poor household will become food-poor or that a food-poor household will remain in poverty in future. The results suggest that non-farm employment exerts a positive and statistically significant effect on the reduction in household food poverty and vulnerability. Specifically, participating in non-farm employment will help decrease the probability of falling into food poverty in future by roughly 19%. We also document that 31% of non-food-poor households in rural areas suffered from vulnerability to food poverty, indicating their high probability of falling into food poverty in future. Additional results from regional evaluation suggest that the North-west region of Vietnam is most vulnerable to food poverty and has an urgent need of targeted government development policies; improving access to non-farm employment could help mitigate vulnerability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Households; Non-farm Employment; Poverty; Rural Vietnam; Vulnerability To Food Poverty; Employment; Poverty; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Vulnerability; Viet Nam","employment; poverty; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; Viet Nam","","","","Econometrica, (1977); Atamanov, Aziz, Participation and returns in rural nonfarm activities: Evidence from the Kyrgyz Republic, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 43, 4, pp. 459-471, (2012); Babatunde, Raphael Olanrewaju, Impact of off-farm income on food security and nutrition in Nigeria, Food Policy, 35, 4, pp. 303-311, (2010); Development Microeconomics, (1999); Barrett, Christopher B., Nonfarm income diversification and household livelihood strategies in rural Africa: Concepts, dynamics, and policy implications, Food Policy, 26, 4, pp. 315-331, (2001); Economic Growth Poverty and Household Welfare in Vietnam, (2004); Brünjes, Jürgen, Obtaining non-farm wage employment in rural Vietnam, Asia Pacific Viewpoint, 57, 2, pp. 263-279, (2016); Calvo, César, Risk and vulnerability to poverty, pp. 215-228, (2008); Cazzuffi, Chiara, The impact of agricultural commercialisation on household welfare in rural Vietnam, Food Policy, 94, (2020); Assessing Household Vulnerability to Poverty from Cross Sectional Data A Methodology and Estimates from Indonesia, (2002)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15732975; 1387585X","","EDSNB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089258691"

Although a large body of research has addressed the effects of forest harvesting on stream temperature, less is known about the responses of stream temperature to the practice of strip‐thinning, which produces more coherent patches of shade and sunlight areas. In this study, we examined stream temperature response to 50% strip‐thinning in a 17 ha headwater catchment. The thinning lines extended through the riparian zone. Paired‐catchment analysis was applied to estimate changes in daily maximum, mean, and minimum stream temperatures for the first year following treatment. Significant effects on daily maximum stream temperature were found for April to August, ranging from 0.6 °C to 3.9 °C, similar to the magnitude of effect found in previous studies involving 50% random thinning. We conducted further analysis to identify the thermal response variability in relation to hydrometeorological drivers. Multiple regression analysis revealed that treatment effects for maximum daily stream temperature were positively related to solar radiation and negatively related to discharge. Frequent precipitation during the summer monsoon season produced moderate increases in discharge (from 1 to 5 mm day−1), mitigating stream temperature increases associated with solar radiation. Catchment hydrologic response to rain events can play an important role in controlling stream thermal response to forest management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forest Harvesting; Headwater Stream; Paired‐catchment Analysis; Stream Temperature; Strip‐thinning; Catchments; Ecosystems; Radiation Effects; Runoff; Solar Radiation; Biological Process; Forest Harvesting; Forest Management Practices; Headwater Catchment; Hydrologic Response; Multiple Regression Analysis; Stream Temperatures; Treatment Effects; Forestry; Biological Processes; Catchment; Forest Management; Freshwater Ecosystem; Headwater; Hydrological Response; Hydrometeorology; Management Practice; Seasonal Variation; Solar Radiation; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Streamwater","Catchments; Ecosystems; Radiation effects; Runoff; Solar radiation; Biological process; Forest harvesting; Forest management practices; Headwater catchment; Hydrologic response; Multiple regression analysis; Stream temperatures; Treatment effects; Forestry; biological processes; catchment; forest management; freshwater ecosystem; headwater; hydrological response; hydrometeorology; management practice; seasonal variation; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; streamwater","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Japan Science and Technology (JST), Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) projects entitled “Field and modeling studies on the effect of forest devastation on flooding and environmental issues” and “Development of Innovative Technologies for Increasing in Watershed Runoff and Improving River Environment by Management Practice of Devastated Forest Plantation”.

A total of 500 random points were used to validate the burned area map and the results suggested an overall accuracy of about 97.4%, (98.1% of producer's accuracy, 96.2% of user's accuracy with 0.94 kappa-statistics). Our results highlight the potential of NBR in GEE framework for rapid assessment of burnt areas useful for fire management and mitigation purposes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Differential Normalized Burned Ratio (dnbr); Forest Fire; Google Earth Engine; Lao Pdr; Nam Kading Nbca; Shifting Cultivation","","","","This study was part of my PhD research thesis supported by professors from Vietnam National University of Forestry (VNUF), Xuan Mai, Hanoi, Vietnam and my colleagues from Faculty of Forest Sciences, The National University of Laos, Vientiane Capital, Lao People's Democratic Republic.

Recognizing this fact, this study examined the long-term improvement in precautions taken by commune authorities and households between two major floods in 1999 and 2017 by applying both quantitative and qualitative methods. Two flood-prone villages were selected for a survey; one in a rural area and the other in a suburban area of Thua Thien Hue Province, central Vietnam. The findings indicate that most villagers doubted the structural works’ efficacy and were dissatisfied with the current efforts of local authorities. Households’ self-preparation thus became the decisive factor in mitigating risk. While most households have paid greater attention to flood precautions in 2017, others seem to be lagging. Poverty-related barriers were the root causes restraining households in both rural and suburban villages. The suburban riverine residents were further identified as vulnerable by their limitations in upgrading structural measures, which was ascribed to the inconsistency in the ancient town’s preservation policy. This multidimensional comparison, in terms of vulnerability, emphasized the importance of space-function links in the suburb and the contradictions of different policy initiatives, such as landscape rehabilitation, disaster prevention, and livelihood maintenance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Flood Risk Mitigation; Long-term Improvement; Natural Hazards; Precautionary Measures; Flood Frequency; Livelihood; Lowland Environment; Mitigation; Qualitative Analysis; Quantitative Analysis; Risk Assessment; Suburban Area; Vulnerability; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam","flood frequency; livelihood; lowland environment; mitigation; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; suburban area; vulnerability; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam","","","This study was financially supported by the Vietnamese government and Okayama University, Japan.

The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was applied to the Dakbla watershed from 2000 to 2018. After the calibration and validation processes, dissimilar effects between the input conditions on the flow and sediment simulations were confirmed. It was recognized that the impact of the land use on the sediment simulation was more sensitive than with the flow simulation. Additionally, through monthly evaluation, the effects against the flow and sediment in the rainy season were larger than those in the dry season, especially for sediment simulation in the last three months from October to December. Changing land-use conditions could improve flow and sediment simulation performance better than the performance found with static land-use conditions. Updated land-use inputs should be considered in simulations if the given land-use condition changes in a relatively short period because of frequent land-use policy changes by a local government. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Afforestation; Agricultural Expansion; Deforestation; Land-use Conversion; Mountainous Areas; Urbanization; Watershed Modeling; Sediments; Watersheds; Calibration And Validations; Land Use Policy; Local Government; Rainy Seasons; Sediment Discharge; Short Periods; Simulation Performance; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Land Use; Calibration; Discharge; Land Use Change; Local Government; Numerical Model; Performance Assessment; Simulation; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Watershed; Dakbla River; Viet Nam","Sediments; Watersheds; Calibration and validations; Land use policy; Local government; Rainy seasons; Sediment discharge; Short periods; Simulation performance; Soil and water assessment tool; Land use; calibration; discharge; land use change; local government; numerical model; performance assessment; simulation; soil and water assessment tool; watershed; Dakbla River; Viet Nam","","","","Lv, Tingting, Assessment of soil erosion risk in northern Thailand, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 37, pp. 703-708, (2008); Nontananandh, Supakij, Internet GIS, based on USLE modeling, for assessment of soil erosion in Songkhram watershed, Northeastern of Thailand, Kasetsart Journal - Natural Science, 46, 2, pp. 272-282, (2012); Tropics, (2010); Li, Mian, Effect of hillslope aspect on landform characteristics and erosion rates, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 191, 9, (2019); Somura, Hiroaki, Importance of considering nutrient loadings from small watersheds to a lake – A case study of the Lake Shinji watershed, Shimane Prefecture, Japan, International Journal of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, 11, 5, pp. 124-130, (2018); Liang, Dongli, Impacts of land use change and climate variability on hydrology in an agricultural catchment on the Loess Plateau of China, Journal of Hydrology, 377, 1-2, pp. 35-42, (2009); Zettam, Amin, Modelling hydrology and sediment transport in a semi-arid and anthropized catchment using the swat model: The case of the Tafna River (Northwest Algeria), Water (Switzerland), 9, 3, (2017); Hallouz, Faiza, Modeling of discharge and sediment transport through the SWAT model in the basin of Harraza (Northwest of Algeria), Water Science, 32, 1, pp. 79-88, (2018); Yuan, Lifeng, Using SWAT to evaluate streamflow and lake sediment loading in the xinjiang river basin with limited data, Water (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2020); Ngo, Thanh Son, Effect of land use change on runoff and sediment yield in Da River Basin of Hoa Binh province, Northwest Vietnam, Journal of Mountain Science, 12, 4, pp. 1051-1064, (2015)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102658745"

Though there are several existing studies on evacuation modeling in the case of an earthquake, research that integrates road blockades into evacuation simulations is quite limited. From that viewpoint, this research aims to develop evacuation modeling with consideration of road blockades to simulate how residents move to evacuation centers (hereafter, shelters) through urban areas following an earthquake occurrence. The research also determines difficulties that residents may encounter under earthquake conditions, compared with normal conditions, corresponding to considering or not considering road blockades, respectively, such as having no access to shelters, taking longer routes instead of shortest routes, and so on. Debris from damaged buildings in an urban area is assumed as the main source of debris that would cause a road blockade. The model is applied to a case study of the Daitoku school district in Kanazawa city. According to simulated results, due to road blockades, occupants of many damaged buildings did not have access to shelters, and a lot of evacuees needed to move to shelters with longer routes instead of taking the shortest routes. Furthermore, the research results show the possibility of considering road blockades for improving current evacuation modeling and making evacuation simulations more realistic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accessibility; Damaged Building; Debris; Evacuee; Geographic Information System (gis); Network Analysis; Disaster Management; Earthquake Epicenter; Earthquake Event; Modeling; Simulated Annealing; Simulation; Strategic Approach; Urban Area; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Kanazawa","disaster management; earthquake epicenter; earthquake event; modeling; simulated annealing; simulation; strategic approach; urban area; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Kanazawa","","","Funding: This work was funded by JSPS KAKENHI; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) Grant Numbers 20K03138, 19K04750, 18K04523.","Learning from Megadisasterslessons from the Great East Japanese Earthquake Evacuation Center Management, (2014); East Asia Forum, (2016); Bernardini, Gabriele, An agent-based model for earthquake pedestrians' evacuation simulation in Urban scenarios, Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 255-263, (2014); Pourrahmani, Elham, Dynamic evacuation routing plan after an earthquake, Natural Hazards Review, 16, 4, (2015); Han, Yanbin, Extended route choice model based on available evacuation route set and its application in crowd evacuation simulation, Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 75, pp. 1-16, (2017); D'orazio, Marco, Agent-based model for earthquake pedestrians' evacuation in urban outdoor scenarios: Behavioural patterns definition and evacuation paths choice, Safety Science, 62, pp. 450-465, (2014); Proceedings of the International Joint Workshop on Spatial Planning for Disaster Prevention and Sustainable Development, (2016); Nguyen, Dinh Thanh, Comparative study on going to evacuation shelters in school districts and the nearest shelter in the city -A Case Study of Kanazawa City, Japan, Disaster Advances, 10, 8, pp. 21-30, (2017); Nguyen, Dinh Thanh, A GIS-Based Model for Integrating Risk Estimations of Residential Building Damage and Shelter Capacity in the Case of Earthquakes, Natural Hazards Review, 21, 2, (2020); Tamima, Umma, Development of evacuation models for moderate seismic zones: A case study of Montreal, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 16, pp. 167-179, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102601300"

Adaboost is a type of ensemble learning machine that uses classifiers that contain a range of base models. This study used enhanced Adaboost models to classify soil types base on tree algorithm models that are less commonly used in this area. Determining the type of soil in different geotechnical projects is very important. Using soil classification, soil properties such as mechanical properties, performance against static and dynamic loads can be found. Regarding the importance of the subject, 440 samples of the actual project were used to design this new methodology. The dataset included clay content, moisture content, specific gravity, void ratio, plastic, and liquid limit parameters to determine the type of soil classification. These samples were tested with high precision and the actual type of classification was obtained. For comparison, two enhanced tree and neural network model were designed and developed according to these conditions. The results of this classification were presented for different soil samples. The developed adaboost model showed that it could well classify the soil. This model showed that only 11 samples were not correctly identified among the total data (88 data). Therefore, this new technique can be used to increase the accuracy and reduce the cost of projects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaboost; Soil Classification; Soil Type; Tree Model; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Mechanical Property; Numerical Model; Soil Classification; Soil Type","algorithm; artificial neural network; mechanical property; numerical model; soil classification; soil type","","","This study was funded by the Ministry of Education and Training under grant number B2020-GHA-03 chaired by the University of Transport and Communications.","undefined, (2017); Cengage Learning, (2013); Robertson, Peter K., Cone penetration test (CPT)-based soil behaviour type (SBT) classification system — An update, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 53, 12, pp. 1910-1927, (2016); Abbaszadeh Shahri, Abbas, Soil classification analysis based on piezocone penetration test data - A case study from a quick-clay landslide site in southwestern Sweden, Engineering Geology, 189, pp. 32-47, (2015); Bol, Ertan, The influence of pore pressure gradients in soil classification during piezocone penetration test, Engineering Geology, 157, pp. 69-78, (2013); Cai, Guojun, Comparison of CPT charts for soil classification using PCPT data: Example from clay deposits in Jiangsu Province, China, Engineering Geology, 121, 1-2, pp. 89-96, (2011); Gylland, Anders Samstad, Cptu classification diagrams for identification of sensitive clays, Advances in Natural and Technological Hazards Research, 46, pp. 57-66, (2017); Robertson, Peter K., Soil classification using the cone penetration test, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 27, 1, pp. 151-158, (1990); Saye, Steven R., Linear trendlines to assess soil classification from cone penetration test data, Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering - ASCE, 143, 9, (2017); Schneider, James A., Analysis of factors influencing soil classification using normalized piezocone tip resistance and pore pressure parameters, Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering - ASCE, 134, 11, pp. 1569-1586, (2008)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22143912","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100202337"

MGs can contribute to mitigating the operating cost and environmental emissions of power systems. Accordingly, the optimal operation of such systems is of very high significance. In this relation, the problem of optimal day-ahead scheduling of MGs is studied in this paper in the presence of renewable power generation, EVs, and storage systems. The problem is modeled as a scenario-based stochastic optimization problem, characterized using the Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) method. The developed framework includes one objective function, defined as the total operating cost minimization and the presented single-objective optimization problem is tackled using an effective optimization technique, named “modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA)”. The suggested optimization framework takes into consideration various charging/discharging patterns of EVs. Finally, the problem is simulated on a test MG and the obtained results are compared to those derived by other algorithms to verify the performance of the MSFLA algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Day-ahead Scheduling; Electric Vehicle; Microgrid; Renewable Energy; Stochastic Programming; Microgrids; Monte Carlo Methods; Operating Costs; Optimization; Scheduling; Electric Vehicles (evs); Environmental Emissions; Modified Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithms; Optimization Framework; Optimization Techniques; Renewable Power Generation; Single Objective Optimization Problems; Stochastic Optimization Problems; Hybrid Vehicles; Algorithm; Alternative Energy; Electric Vehicle; Microgrid; Mitigation; Monte Carlo Analysis; Optimization; Scheduling","Microgrids; Monte Carlo methods; Operating costs; Optimization; Scheduling; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental emissions; Modified shuffled frog leaping algorithms; Optimization framework; Optimization techniques; Renewable power generation; Single objective optimization problems; Stochastic optimization problems; Hybrid vehicles; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; microgrid; mitigation; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; scheduling","","","","Aghaei, Jamshid, Contribution of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles in power system uncertainty management, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 59, pp. 450-458, (2016); Ali, Rawshan Othman, Hydrologic alteration at the upper and middle part of the yangtze river, China: Towards sustainable water resource management under increasing water exploitation, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 19, (2019); Cao, Bin, Hybrid Microgrid Many-Objective Sizing Optimization with Fuzzy Decision, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 28, 11, pp. 2702-2710, (2020); Cao, Bin, Multiobjective Evolution of Fuzzy Rough Neural Network via Distributed Parallelism for Stock Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 28, 5, pp. 939-952, (2020); Zhao, Xuan, Construction of electric vehicle driving cycle for studying electric vehicle energy consumption and equivalent emissions, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 30, pp. 37395-37409, (2020); Bejarano, Maria Dolores, Tradeoff between economic and environmental costs and benefits of hydropower production at run-of-river-diversion schemes under different environmental flows scenarios, Journal of Hydrology, 572, pp. 790-804, (2019); Lu, Hongwei, Evaluating the global potential of aquifer thermal energy storage and determining the potential worldwide hotspots driven by socio-economic, geo-hydrologic and climatic conditions, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 112, pp. 788-796, (2019); Druitt, James, Simulation of demand management and grid balancing with electric vehicles, Journal of Power Sources, 216, pp. 104-116, (2012); Elbeltagi, E.

A quasi-experimental approach is employed with difference-in-differences and propensity score matching to identify the impacts on commuters’ travel time, acceptable walking distance to the nearest stop, and modal share of public transportation. Interviews with public transportation users were conducted to collect data in June 2018, and 501 valid responses were obtained. Respondents were asked about their travel behaviors and perceptions regarding public transportation before and after the BRT introduction. The study assumes a treatment group containing commuters currently using the BRT service and a control group containing those currently using standard bus services. The estimation results reveal that the introduction of the Hanoi BRT service had significantly positive impacts on improving travel time efficiency, increasing the acceptable walking distance to the nearest stop, and encouraging commuters to use more public transportation in their daily journeys. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bus Rapid Transit; Developing Country; Difference-in-differences; Propensity Score Matching; Travel Behavior; Bus Transport; Environmental Impact Assessment; Experimental Study; Perception; Public Transport; Questionnaire Survey; Transportation; Travel Behavior; Travel Time; Urban Area; Hanoi; Viet Nam","bus transport; environmental impact assessment; experimental study; perception; public transport; questionnaire survey; transportation; travel behavior; travel time; urban area; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","The interview survey was implemented with financial support from the Project for the Establishment of the Master Programs of Vietnam-Japan University , which is organized by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

Respondents and questions were each assigned to six groups by cluster analysis of the answers. From the standpoint of the imaginary future generation, three groups of respondents placed higher priority on many issues including the global-scale environmental issue, demonstrating a clear shift of perception depending on the perspective. Their future images of HCMC were deplorable, with more severe climate change impacts, leading to pessimistic answers to the questions. In contrast, two respondent groups that imagined an optimistic HCMC future, where sufficient economic and technological development will solve the issues, placed lower priority on most of the issues.

Various physico-chemical parameters were analyzed for surface water samples collected from five sampling locations from 2016 to 2020. Time-series analysis of key surface water quality parameters was performed to identify the essential hydrological processes governing water quality. The analyzed water quality data were also used to calculate the heavy metal pollution index (HPI), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) and weighted water quality index (WQI). Also, the spatial trend of water quality is compared with LULC changes from 2015 to 2020. Results revealed that the concentration of most of the physico-chemical parameters in the water samples was beyond the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted permissible limit, except for a few parameters in some locations. Based on the calculated values of HPI and HEI, water quality samples were categorized as low to moderately polluted water bodies, whereas all water samples fell under the poor category (>100) and beyond based on the calculated WQI. Looking precisely at the water quality’s temporal trend, it is found that most of the sampling shows a deteriorating trend from 2016 to 2019. However, the year 2020 shows a slightly improving trend on water quality, which can be justified by lowering human activities during the lockdown period imposed by COVID-19. Land use has a significant relationship with surface water quality, and it was evident that built-up land had a more significant negative impact on water quality than the other land use classes. Both natural processes (rock weathering) and anthropogenic activities (wastewater discharge, industrial activities etc.) were found to be playing a vital role in water quality evolution. This study suggests that continuous assessment and monitoring of the spatial and temporal variability of water quality in Limpopo is important to control pollution and health safety in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hei; Hpi; Surface Water Quality; Wqi; Heavy Metals; Land Use; Metal Analysis; Quality Control; River Pollution; Surface Water Resources; Time Series Analysis; Water Pollution Control; Water Quality; Weathering; Anthropogenic Activity; Heavy Metal Evaluations; Industrial Activities; Land Use And Land Cover; Physico - Chemical Parameters; Spatial And Temporal Variability; Spatiotemporal Analysis; World Health Organization; Surface Waters; Heavy Metal; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Physicochemical Property; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Surface Water; Water Quality; Limpopo; Mokopane; South Africa","Heavy metals; Land use; Metal analysis; Quality control; River pollution; Surface water resources; Time series analysis; Water pollution control; Water quality; Weathering; Anthropogenic activity; Heavy metal evaluations; Industrial activities; Land use and land cover; Physico - chemical parameters; Spatial and temporal variability; Spatiotemporal analysis; World Health Organization; Surface waters; heavy metal; land cover; land use change; physicochemical property; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; water quality; Limpopo; Mokopane; South Africa","","","","Water Qual Expo Health, (2011); Kazi, Tasneem Gul, Assessment of water quality of polluted lake using multivariate statistical techniques: A case study, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 72, 2, pp. 301-309, (2009); Kumar, Pankaj Ravi, Numerical quantification of current status quo and future prediction of water quality in eight Asian megacities: challenges and opportunities for sustainable water management, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 191, 6, (2019); Rev Bras Biol, (2000); Water A Shared Responsibility, (2006); Technol Sci Rev, (2014); Sila, Onesmus Nzung A., Physico-chemical and bacteriological quality of water sources in rural settings, a case study of Kenya, Africa, Scientific African, 2, (2019); Bello, Marcelo O., Factors affecting water uptake of rice grain during soaking, LWT, 37, 8, pp. 811-816, (2004); Avtar, Ram, Utilizing geospatial information to implement SDGs and monitor their Progress, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 192, 1, (2020); International Journal of Scientific Research in Environmental Sciences, (2015)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099789527"

Men and women in 15 countries (NTOTAL = 4701) completed self-report measures assessing self-esteem and the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-defeating, and self-enhancing. Each of the country samples had self-esteem averages at or above the midpoint of the scale, but did vary. The samples from Colombia and Serbia had the highest self-esteem values and Russia had the lowest. For all of the country samples, with the exception of Russia, the multiple regression results demonstrated that a greater level of the self-enhancing humor style positively predicted higher self-esteem scores. As the self-enhancing humor style involves improving one’s mood with humor, the results suggest that for the majority of the participants, self-enhancing humor styles also help to increase self-esteem. The results are discussed both within countries and across the samples. In particular, the unique finding that not a self-enhancing humor style but an aggressive humor style predicts self-esteem in the Russian sample is discussed. The chapter ends with a discussion of how humor styles correlate with mental health indicators and how the understanding of humor style profiles are related to well-being across countries adds to the global understanding of individual differences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-culture; Humor Styles; Self-enhancing; Self-esteem","","","","","Social Science Research Council Bulletin, (1942); Baumeister, Roy F., Does high self-esteem cause better performance, interpersonal success, happiness, or healthier lifestyles?, Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, 1, (2003); World Applied Sciences Journal, (2007); Self Esteem Issues and Answers, (2006); Approaches to Personality Inventory Construction A Compari, (1984); Burisch, Matthias, Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits, American Psychologist, 39, 3, pp. 214-227, (1984); Chen, Guohai, A comparison of humor styles, coping humor, and mental health between Chinese and Canadian university students, Humor, 20, 3, pp. 215-234, (2007); Erickson, Sarah J., Adolescent humor and its relationship to coping, defense strategies, psychological distress, and well-being, Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 37, 3, pp. 255-271, (2007); Ford, Thomas E., Personality, humor styles and happiness: Happy people have positive humor styles, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 320-337, (2016); Fox, Claire Louise, Longitudinal associations between humor styles and psychosocial adjustment in adolescence, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 377-389, (2016)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783030782795; 9783030782801","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161882459"

Previous defense methods capture word substitutions in vector space by using either l<inf>2</inf>-ball or hyper-rectangle, which results in perturbation sets that are not inclusive enough or unnecessarily large, and thus impedes mimicry of worst cases for robust training. In this paper, we introduce a novel Adversarial Sparse Convex Combination (ASCC) method. We model the word substitution attack space as a convex hull and leverages a regularization term to enforce perturbation towards an actual substitution, thus aligning our modeling better with the discrete textual space. Based on the ASCC method, we further propose ASCC-defense, which leverages ASCC to generate worst-case perturbations and incorporates adversarial training towards robustness. Experiments show that ASCC-defense outperforms the current state-of-the-arts in terms of robustness on two prevailing NLP tasks, i.e., sentiment analysis and natural language inference, concerning several attacks across multiple model architectures. Besides, we also envision a new class of defense towards robustness in NLP, where our robustly trained word vectors can be plugged into a normally trained model and enforce its robustness without applying any other defense techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Network Security; Sentiment Analysis; As Substitutions; Attack Spaces; Convex Combination Method; Convex Combinations; Hyperrectangles; Language Processing; Natural Languages; Robust Trainings; Stepping-stones; Substitution Attack; Vector Spaces","Network security; Sentiment analysis; As substitutions; Attack spaces; Convex combination method; Convex combinations; Hyperrectangles; Language processing; Natural languages; Robust trainings; Stepping-stones; Substitution attack; Vector spaces","","","This work is supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (No. 62025603), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1705262, No. 62072386, No. 62072387, No. 62072389, No. 62002305, No. 61772443, No. 61802324, and No. 61702136).","Alzantot, Moustafa Farid, Generating natural language adversarial examples, pp. 2890-2896, (2018); Interpretable Adversarial Training for Text, (2019); Belinkov, Yonatan, Synthetic and natural noise both break neural machine translation, (2018); J Oper Res Soc, (1997); Language, (1926); Bowman, Samuel R., A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference, pp. 632-642, (2015); Convex Optimization Algorithms and Complexity, (2014); IEEE S P, (2017); C R Acad Sci Paris, (1847); Corr, (2018)","","International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR","Amazon; DeepMind; et al.; Facebook AI; Microsoft; OpenAI","9th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2021","","Virtual, Online","186703","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137005484"

The current system of PA governance contributes to the protection of biodiversity, albeit in an overlapping and complicated manner. The greatest contribution of policy towards PAs is the decentralization and delegation of additional powers to provincial and municipal authorities. Decentralization triggers diverse forms of investment for tourism, which is commonly espoused as a solution to balance the concurrent needs of economic development and biodiversity conservation. However, more recently, by analysing resource politics in the mountain area of Hoang Lien National Park (HLNP), the authors contend that a recentralization of resource management is evident in a new form of partnership investment in mega tourism projects. In addition to analysis of resource governance and management, the chapter highlights major challenges to the promotion of nature-based tourism in and around PAs as a sustainable livelihood for locals. Having discussed these challenges in the context of HLNP against the backdrop of tourism development, issues concerning tourism policy, governance, and livelihoods are addressed in the context of PAs’ fragile ecological systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Governance; Hoang Lien National Park; Nature-based Tourism; Protected Areas","","","","Government funding for SUFs comes from a wide range of funds to ‘develop’ national parks (both provincial and national). The 5 Million Hectare Reforestation Program is commonly used for forest protection contracts and tree planting in buffer zones, as well as ‘ecological regeneration’ areas within PA core zones. The 135 Program from the Infrastructure Development Fund administered by Ministry of Planning and Investment can finance local infrastructure, such as schools and irrigation systems, in buffer zones, and is often used to construct buildings and roads inside PAs. Management boards can also apply to the Department of Science, Technology and Product Quality of MARD for funding to support research, although capacity to review prepare proposals to access these funds is limited (ICEM, 2003). International donors, such as WWF, FFI, ILO are another source of funds for conservation management. Most donor support is for large, site-specific projects and is often used for investment and the conservation needs that the government budgets cannot meet. This source of funds is increasingly important and functions as a vehicle to attract foreign researchers and visitors to PAs (ICEM, 2003).","An, Le Thanh, The comparative analyses of selected aspects of conservation and management of Vietnam's national parks, Nature Conservation, 25, pp. 1-30, (2018); Development of A National Ecotourism Strategy for Vietnam, (1999); Austrian Journal of South East Asian Studies, (2011); Sustainable Financing of Protected Areas A Global Review of Challenges and Options, (2006); Pa Financing Mechanism in Vietnam Lessons Learned and Future Direction, (2011); Gaughan, Andrea Elizabeth, Tourism, forest conversion, and land transformations in the Angkor basin, Cambodia, Applied Geography, 29, 2, pp. 212-223, (2009); Report of Management of Sufs, (2019); Nien Giam Th Ong Ke to Ng Diu Tra Dan S O 2010 National Vietnamese Census Year Book, (2010); Bu O C Du Nghien Cu U Hot Dng Du Lch Trekking Ti Vu O N Qu Oc Gia Hoang Lien Theo Quan Die M Du Lch Sinh Thai Exploratory Study on Trekking Tourism in Hoang Lien National Park an Ecotourism View, (2010); Hoang, Huong Thi Thu, Changing human-landscape interactions after development of tourism in the northern Vietnamese Highlands, Anthropocene, 5, pp. 42-51, (2014)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","23665629; 23665610","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129930909"

President Ho Chi Minh, a talented leader of Vietnam and the world has emphasized so much on the youth education as they are the future generation and the owner of the nation. In the relationship between individuals and society, Ho Chi Minh requires young people to ask themselves what they have done for the country, not what the country has given them? Must educate young people to have love and responsibility for everyone. Young people must regularly practice self-criticism and serious criticism to help each other progress.

Yet almost no research has investigated the degree to which and in what ways volitional personality change (VPC), or individuals’ active efforts toward personality change, might be common around the world. Through a custom-built website, 13,278 college student participants from 55 countries and one of a larger country (Hong Kong, S.A.R.) using 42 different languages reported whether they were currently trying to change their personality and, if so, what they were trying to change. Around the world, 60.40% of participants reported that they are currently trying to change their personalities, with the highest percentage in Thailand (81.91%) and the lowest in Kenya (21.41%). Among those who provide open-ended responses to the aspect of personality they are trying to change, the most common goals were to increase emotional stability (29.73%), conscientiousness (19.71%), extraversion (15.94%), and agreeableness (13.53%). In line with previous research, students who are trying to change any personality trait tend to have relatively low levels of emotional stability and happiness. Moreover, those with relatively low levels of socially desirable traits reported attempting to increase what they lacked.

Results suggest that although income from non-farm activities contributes to relaxing credit constraints among farmers, such alleviation does not necessarily allow farmers to increase their on-farm investments. We found that in the developed regions where farmers participate and earn more from non-farm activities, despite there being a low level of credit constraints, their investment in agriculture is still limited due to the labour constraints of the farm household. In contrast, in the less developed regions, where farmers have less access to non-farm income sources, they tend to invest their non-farm income in on-farm activities. The article contributes to the literature by showing that differ-ences in credit constraints levels lead to variations in farm households’ decisions on whether or not to direct non-farm income towards investment in agricultural production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Inputs Investment; Credit/liquidity Constraints; Non-farm Activities; Regions; Vietnam","","","","","Humanities and Social Sciences, (2020); Ahituv, Avner, Off-farm work and capital accumulation decisions of farmers over the life-cycle: The role of heterogeneity and state dependence, Journal of Development Economics, 68, 2, pp. 329-353, (2002); Anríquez, G., Linkages between the farm and nonfarm sectors at the household level in rural Ghana: A consistent stochastic distance function approach, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 41, 1, pp. 51-66, (2010); Barrett, Christopher B., Nonfarm income diversification and household livelihood strategies in rural Africa: Concepts, dynamics, and policy implications, Food Policy, 26, 4, pp. 315-331, (2001); Bui, Khac Linh, Non-farm employment, food poverty and vulnerability in rural Vietnam, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 23, 5, pp. 7326-7357, (2021); Carter, Michael R., Getting institutions ""right"" for whom?

That makes even more sense in the context of the current covid 19 pandemic and increasing social distancing. It can be said that the appearance of the COVID-19 epidemic has adversely affected the economy, fundamentally changing people’s living and consumption behavior. Meanwhile, business sectors are facing the risk of production shutdown because of capital flow downturn, idle operation or bankruptcy because of covid19. The reason for social distancing forces people to not be able to travel freely to carry out travel and shopping behaviors like before. Previously normal activities were restricted from being concentrated in large places, leading to a business industry that was supposed to be super-profitable and a major contributor to a high GDP structure such as tourism, which is facing a dilemma. The tourist season is coming, but the number of tourists suddenly drops because of social distancing. That risk poses a big obstacle to the tourism industry, but it will be an opportunity if we know how to take advantage of the 4.0 technology revolution. That will help make use of smart digital technology applications to exploit and develop different types of tourism. Research and propose ideas to apply VR technology to develop smart tourism industry, helping tourists from all over the world can use and experience famous tourist attractions of Vietnam.

Among economic sectors, tourism is a very important industry that contributes greatly to GDP growth of the country in the current context. Forecasting tourism revenue is very important to have reasonable policies or decisions at the macro level. In fact, in this period, with new concepts of smart cities and smart communities, we experienced IoTs (internet of things) roles in developing and promoting our local and community tourism services very much. In the current context, digital transformation is an inevitable development trend. Currently, businesses that do not follow this trend will not be able to access new achievements and advancements and will find it difficult to participate in the new value chain that digital transformation brings. The article uses the method of analyzing and forecasting tourism industry revenue. This paper proposes a solution to apply an analysis and forecasting method through linear regression to forecast tourism revenue. To implement this method, the article collects and analyzes data, thereby proposing solutions to promote socio-economic development and tourism industry. The research results will play an important role, helping policymakers to be proactive in making necessary plans and decisions for business, investment, and promotion processes of travel to increase revenue, etc. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analysis And Forecast; Computer Skills; Digital Transformation Of The Tourism Industry; Regression; Tourism Revenue","","","","","Attaran, Mohsen, Information technology and business-process redesign, Business Process Management Journal, 9, 4, pp. 440-458, (2003); Research on Building Linkage Models in Community Based Tourism Development to Increase Income for Households in the Western Districts of Ha Giang Province, (2019); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Becker, Brian E., Strategic human resources management: Where do we go from here?, Journal of Management, 32, 6, pp. 898-925, (2006); Bell, Bradford S., The impact of e-HR on professional competence in HRM: Implications for the development of HR professionals, Human Resource Management, 45, 3, pp. 295-308, (2006); Black, Janice A., Strategic resources: Traits, configurations and paths to sustainable competitive advantage, Strategic Management Journal, 15, 2 S, pp. 131-148, (1994); Broadbent, Marianne, Strategic context and patterns of IT infrastructure capability, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 8, 2, pp. 157-187, (1999); Clemons, Eric K., Corporate Strategies for Information Technology: A Resource-Based Approach, Computer, 24, 11, pp. 23-32, (1991); Ngoc Huy, Dinh Tran, The critical analysis of limited south asian corporate governance standards after financial crisis, International Journal for Quality Research, 9, 4, pp. 741-764, (2015); Grant, Robert M., The Resource-Based Theory of Competitive Advantage: Implications for Strategy Formulation, California Management Review, 33, 3, pp. 114-135, (1991)","","Webology Center","","","","","","1735188X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119519779"

Therefore, countries in general and Vietnam are all aiming to develop the digital economy. The concept of digital transformation of the economy or development of the digital economy in Vietnam focuses on the following basic contents: 1) Developing digital businesses; 2) Digital transformation for traditional businesses (towards digitally integrated products; transforming business models on digital platforms; changing production processes based on digital data, automation, virtualization, etc.); 3) Development of digital finance; 4) E-commerce development. Therefore, digital transformation becomes an inevitable and objective trend, supporting banks to overcome challenges, create competitive advantages, and actively adapt to the context of digital transformation. In the context of the development of the digital economy in Vietnam is taking place strongly across industries and fields, requiring banks in Vietnam to have a transformation to a new business model. In this business model, it is necessary to integrate technology in operations and digitize business processes in the direction of automation and intelligence. Thereby, banks can perform activities of providing products and services on digital platforms, effectively exploiting data, thereby increasing experiences in business resolution and customer engagement. Besides, Internet of things has connect everything through internet, therefore risk management information system of Vietnam banks is also affected by IoTs and reliable internet data can help to enhance better RMIS in commercial banks.

This article examines what state-sanctioned satirical cartoons can reveal about the representation and management of political criticism in such a context. We find a growing trend of depicting corruption as a systemic problem, which is present in 45 per cent of the sample and in 70 per cent of the 20 most-viral cartoons in one of Vietnam’s most popular magazines, Tuoi Tre Cuoi (Youth Humour). This trend can be interpreted as a change in the sensibility of audiences and a shift toward a more tolerant media landscape. The trend, however, may also be a worrying sign of the dual dangers of cynicism in Vietnamese politics: the development of apathy among audiences and the cynical use of art by authorities. Despite these concerns, we argue, political cartoons in Vietnam provide an important public avenue for collective political reflection and everyday social solidarity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cartoons; Corruption; Discursive Pre-emption; Mass Media; Political Communication; Political Satire; Social Media; Vietnam","","","","The authors would like to thank Hong-Kong To Nguyen, Manh-Toan Ho and Minh-Hoang Nguyen for their support.","Stifling the Public Sphere Media and Civil Society in Vietnam, (2015); Alkazemi, Mariam F., Kuwaiti political cartoons during the Arab Spring: Agenda setting and self-censorship, Journalism, 16, 5, pp. 630-653, (2015); Becker, Amy B., Satire as a source for learning?

In the national energy efficiency program, the government set the target of saving 7.0% of the energy consumption in the period of 2019–2030 (Government of Viet Nam (2020)). Although there are a number of fiscal measures with major government-led financing facilities dedicated for energy efficiency (EE) technologies with preferential term loans coupled with technical assistance, EE investment in Viet Nam is still at a nascent stage and leaves room for development in the coming time. The impediments preventing EE investment come from lacking the motivation to adopt EE technologies as a result of low energy (electricity) costs; the reluctance of the domestic financial market in financing EE projects when professional expertise is unqualified and inexperienced to confidently implement credit appraisals and lending decisions to the EE that is perceived as a niche, and a new segment with the high level of credit risk. Besides, the underdevelopment of energy saving companies’ operation in offering EE solutions and financing options is also an issue resulting in an immature EE investment environment in the country. To achieve the national target of EE and scaling-up EE investment with the outlook of market-based solutions for EE in Viet Nam in the future, major recommendations include focusing on dedicated EE facilities to energy-intensive industry, promulgating necessary regulations and policies to facilitate energy saving companies, and amending and revising the electricity pricing policy to increase users’ motivation to EE technologies.

Automated information extraction over chemical patents is, however, a challenging task due to the large volume of existing patents and the complex linguistic properties of chemical patents. The Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), was introduced to support the development of advanced text mining techniques for chemical patents. The ChEMU 2020 lab proposed two fundamental information extraction tasks focusing on chemical reaction processes described in chemical patents: (1) chemical named entity recognition, requiring identification of essential chemical entities and their roles in chemical reactions, as well as reaction conditions; and (2) event extraction, which aims at identification of event steps relating the entities involved in chemical reactions. The ChEMU 2020 lab received 37 team registrations and 46 runs. Overall, the performance of submissions for these tasks exceeded our expectations, with the top systems outperforming strong baselines. We further show the methods to be robust to variations in sampling of the test data. We provide a detailed overview of the ChEMU 2020 corpus and its annotation, showing that inter-annotator agreement is very strong. We also present the methods adopted by participants, provide a detailed analysis of their performance, and carefully consider the potential impact of data leakage on interpretation of the results.

Vietnam claims the second-largest maritime area in the South China Sea dispute after China. A comparison of two recent cases—the arbitration between the Philippines and China and the conciliation between Timor-Leste and Australia—highlights the importance of selecting between binding and nonbinding decisions and framing a complaint. In particular, any legal action under UNCLOS should specify China’s claims and actions in areas that encroach on Vietnam’s claimed exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and violate international law. policy implications • Were Vietnam to build a case against China in the South China Sea based on maritime entitlements, rather than boundary delimitation, it should initiate a compulsory arbitration procedure pursuant of Article 287 and Annex VII of UNCLOS. In taking this step, Vietnam should seek a ruling regarding (1) entitlements to living and nonliving resources in its EEZ and continental shelf and (2) the legality of China’s claims and activities in the South China Sea. • While Vietnam continues to prefer negotiations, the growing assertiveness of China, including its activities in Vietnam’s claimed EEZ, may change this calculation.

Understanding and quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban land use and land cover changes, as well as the driving factors behind them, are therefore vital in order to design appropriate policies and monitoring mechanisms to govern urban growth. This study analyzes land use and land cover changes over Hilla city through remote sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques. IKONOS satellite imagery from years 2000, 2005, and 2011 was collected and pre-processed using ENVI and ArcGIS, which then goes through an object-based supervised image classification stage to generate land use and land cover maps. The classification is performed using the statistical machine learning algorithm, SVM (Support Vector Machine). The confusion matrix and kappa coefficients are used to evaluate the overall accuracy of the results. The statistical results obtained enable assessment of class changes from years 2000 to 2011 and also identify the gain and loss of the built-up areas in relation to other land cover classes. The results also allow assessment of the spatial trend of these built-up areas. Ultimately, forecasts can be made to predict expected future class changes in 2026 and 2036. Generally, the results of this study show increased expansions of built-up areas, i.e., from 8.14% in 2000 to 14.53% in 2005 and up to 18.36% in 2011. All this was at the expense of bare land areas. Simultaneously, there was an increased expansion of vegetation/agricultural land area, specifically from 36.14% in 2000 to 41.71% in 2005 and 45.13% in 2011. The spatial trend also shows that the growth of built-up areas is focused in the southwestern part of Hilla city. In all, we foresee that the findings of this study can provide a good visual resource for decision-makers to perform more efficient urban planning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Built-up Areas; Land Use Dynamics; Spatial Trend; Support Vector Machine; Urbanization","","","","","undefined; Ashour, Mohammed W., Machining process classification using PCA reduced histogram features and the Support Vector Machine, pp. 414-418, (2016); Barbero-Sierra, Celia, The case of urban sprawl in Spain as an active and irreversible driving force for desertification, Journal of Arid Environments, 90, pp. 95-102, (2013); Bernstein, Lawrence S., Quick atmospheric correction code: Algorithm description and recent upgrades, Optical Engineering, 51, 11, (2012); Bürgi, Matthias, Driving forces of landscape change - Current and new directions, Landscape Ecology, 19, 8, pp. 857-868, (2005); Chauvin, Juan Pablo, What is different about urbanization in rich and poor countries?

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the stringency of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) countermeasures in Japan against their G20 cohorts. Primary data were monitored at a ski resort in Kyushu regarding the social acceptance of initial COVID-19 countermeasures, ranging from hygiene and local “lockdowns” to border control measures. Design/methodology/approach: The stringency of the COVID-19 countermeasures was examined using data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) and triangulated with the early stage social acceptance of survey respondents in Aso Kuju National Park in February 2020 that consisted of 165 valid Japanese language questionnaires. Findings: An one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified significant differences in social acceptance for countermeasures, with more-concerned respondents agreeing more strongly with “low-tech” health protocols, such as washing hands (M = 3.7) or wearing a mask (3.4). More concerned visitors were significantly more likely to modify their travel plans (2.9) or cancel their trip altogether (2.7). Male day trippers were less likely to be concerned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This paper's originality is derived from a triangulation of the stringency of Japan's initial COVID-19 countermeasures via a combination of comparison with G20 cohorts and social acceptance of domestic snowboarders and skiers. Moreover, by shining a light on the trade-off between public health and human rights, the paper provides a current review of the ethical dimension of a travel restriction debate that is often overlooked in the ongoing pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coronavirus; Covid-19 Counter-measures; Domestic Perceptions; Human Rights; International Tourists; Social Acceptance; Stringency; Travel Restrictions","","","","Thank you to the survey respondents, Kujyu Forest Park Skiing Ground and the Japanese Ministry of Environment.","An, Brian Y., Lessons From COVID-19 Responses in East Asia: Institutional Infrastructure and Enduring Policy Instruments, American Review of Public Administration, 50, 6-7, pp. 790-800, (2020); Anzai, Asami, Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (Covid-19), Journal of Clinical Medicine, 9, 2, (2020); Baum, Tom G., Hospitality, tourism, human rights and the impact of COVID-19, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 32, 7, pp. 2397-2407, (2020); Brug, Johannes, SARS risk perception, knowledge, precautions, and information sources, the Netherlands, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 10, 8, pp. 1486-1489, (2004); Cai, Hua, Sex difference and smoking predisposition in patients with COVID-19, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 8, 4, (2020); Chen, Justin A., Potential impact of COVID-19-related racial discrimination on the health of Asian Americans, American Journal of Public Health, 110, 11, pp. 1624-1627, (2020); Chen, Simiao, Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies, The Lancet, 395, 10232, pp. 1305-1314, (2020); Chia, Terkuma I., Human health versus human rights: An emerging ethical dilemma arising from coronavirus disease pandemic, Ethics, Medicine and Public Health, 14, (2020); Choi, Jiyoung, Smart Korea: Governance for smart justice during a global pandemic, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 29, 2-3, pp. 540-549, (2021); Cooper, Malcolm J.M., Japanese tourism and the SARS epidemic of 2003, Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 19, 2-3, pp. 117-131, (2006)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","2055592X; 20555911","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109873158"

There are debates around a possible change in the economic return to education as it expands and by that education may have become a positional good. This study uses Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSS) data over the period of 2002 to 2014 with a sample of 212,521 individuals to explore how educational expansion influences the strength of the relationship between education (its absolute and relative measures) and income. The instrument-free method was employed to minimize bias. Results suggest that as higher education expands, the effect of the absolute measure of the years of schooling on labor market outcomes does not differ, but the effect of its positional measure on these outcomes does. Likewise, as higher education expands, the effect of the absolute measure of higher education graduation on labor market outcomes does not vary, but the effect of its relative measure on these outcomes does. The findings support the positional theory of education, which predicts that the absolute level of education is not critical, but rather its level relative to that of other individuals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Education Return; Educational Expansion; Higher Education; Labor Market; Positional Good","","","","","Acemoglu, Daron, Skills, tasks and technologies: Implications for employment and earnings, Handbook of Labor Economics, 4, PART B, pp. 1043-1171, (2011); Arrow, Kenneth J., Higher education as a filter, Journal of Public Economics, 2, 3, pp. 193-216, (1973); Ashenfelter, Orley C., A review of estimates of the schooling/earnings relationship, with tests for publication bias, Labour Economics, 6, 4, pp. 453-470, (1999); Barone, Carlo, Overeducation among European University Graduates: A comparative analysis of its incidence and the importance of higher education differentiation, Higher Education, 61, 3, pp. 325-337, (2011); Bennell, Paul, Using and abusing rates of return: A critique of the World Bank's 1995 education sector review, International Journal of Educational Development, 16, 3 SPEC.

In this study, the rice growth was observed by a small UAV-based LiDAR system from above. For developing the system, DJI S800 was chosen as a platform on which a non-survey-grade laser scanner HOKUYO UTM30LX-EW was mounted. Field experiments were carried out from late June to late early August 2017 in Nagaoka city, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Percentile analysis is applied to locate the top and bottom positions of rice plants in three targeted areas. LIDAR-derived plant height is computed by taking the difference between the bottom and the rice plant's top. As a result, the LiDAR-derived canopy height well correlates to rice plant height (R2 ≥0.86; RMSE <6.0 cm). The small root means square error (RMSE =4.9 cm) is achieved with area 3. In the general case, the RMSE is 5.5 cm (R2 =0.88).

Mice were fed diets containing whole LP powder, MetOH extract, and MetOH residue for 16 d. DSS administration for 9 d induced bodyweight loss, reduced colon length, reduced the colonic expression of tight junction proteins including zonula occludens-1 and-2, and claudin-3 and-7, and upregulated colonic mRNA expression of interleukin 6, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2. Feeding LP powder restored these abnormalities, and the MetOH residue, but not MetOH extract, also showed similar restorations. Feeding LP powder and MetOH residue increased fecal concentrations of acetate and n-butyrate.

We applied logistic regression models with various predisposing factors (such as age, gender, and educational level), enabling factors (such as living arrangements and social participation) and health-needs factors (such as self-rated health and chronic conditions) associated with older people’s utilization of healthcare services. We found that about 90% of older persons visited a health facility for health treatment, with older persons living in the Central region being more likely than their Northern counterparts in using healthcare services. Also, our studies showed that the predisposing factors and enabling factors widened the regional disparities, however the health-needs factors helped narrow the differences. In addition, chronic conditions were the most important predictors for older people in utilizing healthcare services, and receiving monetary support from children was the main driver for rural older people. By contrast, health insurance was not a predictor of health service access, and this could be elucidated apart by the fact that services paid by health insurance were limited. We discussed some policies to improve the utilization of healthcare services for older people, particularly we argued that social insurance mechanisms must be improved, and familial support to older people in rural areas should be further enabled. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aging; Disparity; Health Status; Healthcare; Older People; Vietnam","","","","","Andersen, Ronald Max, Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: does it matter?, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 36, 1, pp. 1-10, (1995); Bang, Kyungsook, Health Status and the Demand for Healthcare among the Elderly in the Rural Quoc-Oai District of Hanoi in Vietnam, BioMed Research International, 2017, (2017); Asia Pacific Population Journal, (2013); Journal of Economics Development, (2016); Economic Studies, (2017); Guo, Man, Is family relations related to health service utilisation among older immigrants: Evidence from Chinese elderly in the United States, Health and Social Care in the Community, 27, 1, pp. 215-225, (2019); Joint Annual Health Report 2016 Towards A Healthy Aging in Vietnam, (2018); Vietnam, (2018); Laksono, Agung Dwi, Urban and rural disparities in hospital utilization among Indonesian adults, Iranian Journal of Public Health, 48, 2, pp. 247-255, (2019); Lee, Hwa Young, Use of high-level health facilities and catastrophic expenditure in Vietnam: Can health insurance moderate this relationship?, BMC Health Services Research, 19, 1, (2019)","","Mahidol University, Institute for Population and Social Research","","","","","","24654418","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102423521"

First, we enhance source context to predict the target words by connecting directly the source embeddings to the output of the attention component in NMT. Second, we propose an algorithm to learn morphology of unknown words for English in supervised way in order to minimize the adverse effect of rare-word problem. Finally, we exploit synonymous relation from the WordNet to overcome out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem of NMT.

However, until now the influence of drought on residents’ health in the lower MDR, where river drought is highly sensitive to recently built hydropower plants, has not been examined. The objectives of this study are, for the first time, to detect the health impacts of river drought on residents and to evaluate the contribution of hydropower dams to the impacts of drought on health in the lower Mekong Delta Region (MDR). We applied the multi-step approaches of a Detection and Attribution study. First, we detected the effects of the river drought on the risk of hospitalization using a Multivariable Fractional Polynomials algorithm (MFP). Second, we linked the long-term changes of the river water level (RWL) to the operation of the first hydropower dam in the upper MDR using the interrupted time-series model (ITS). Finally, we quantified the hospitalizations and related economic loss attributed to the river drought. The results show that the percentage changes in risk of all-cause, respiratory, and renal hospitalizations attributed to the river drought were 2%, 2%, and 7%. There were significant reductions in average level and trend of the RWL during the post-1995 period, when the first hydropower dam began operation in the upper MDR, even though the cumulative rainfall in the MDR had not changed. The all-cause hospitalizations attributed to the river drought were 1134 cases during the period 1995–2014, which resulted in total additional cost at two provincial hospitals of US $360,385. This current study demonstrates the link between hydropower dams, river drought, and health impacts. As the MDR is highly vulnerable to climate change, these findings about the devastating impacts of hydropower dams and environmental change have important implications for the lives of downstream residents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Health Impacts; Hospitalized Risk; Hydropower Dams; River Drought","","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Griffith University Internal Grant “Climate Change, Water Quality and Water-related Diseases in Lower Mekong Delta Basin in Vietnam”.

Currently, two policies have been implemented: The tourism development and payments for forest environmental services (PFES) programs. This study employs both semi-structured and in-depth interviews to analyze the relationships between tourism development, ethnic differences, and the PFES in the PNKB NP area. The results are as follows. The PNKB NP has devoted much time to the tourism development policy, with some success. However, disparities in implementation have meant that central areas, such as Xuan Tien Village, have benefited significantly from tourism revenue, whereas remote areas, such as Rao Con village have not yet had the opportunity to participate in income-generating tourism activities. As a result, the gap between the livelihoods of the two villages has widened, exacerbated by inappropriate distributions of the financial budget (the Phong Nha fee). Moreover, the lack of participation in the policy by local residents has meant the PFES has had little effect on their livelihoods. Thus, although the aforementioned policies were expected to improve local livelihoods, this has not occurred, because the PFES mechanism does not sufficiently consider those living in the area.. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Development Disparity; Local Livelihood; Payments For Forest Environmental Services; Phong Nha-ká Bàng National Park; Tourism; Ecosystem Service; Ecotourism; Environmental Policy; Forest Management; Livelihood; Nature Conservation; Tourism Development; Tourism Management; Phong Nha-ke Bang National Park; Viet Nam","ecosystem service; ecotourism; environmental policy; forest management; livelihood; nature conservation; tourism development; tourism management; Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park; Viet Nam","","","","Stakeholder Perceptions of Mexico S Payment for Environmental Services Program A Comparative Study of Socioeconomic and Environmental Impacts in Oaxaca and Yucatan, (2012); Dang, Hai Anh H., Vietnam: A widening poverty gap for ethnic minorities, pp. 304-343, (2012); Fujii, Tomoki, Has the development gap between the ethnic minority and majority groups narrowed in Vietnam?: Evidence from household surveys, World Economy, 41, 8, pp. 2067-2101, (2018); Sustainable Tourism and Poverty Elimination, (1998); Hübner, Anna, Good governance and tourism development in protected areas: The case of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, central Vietnam, Koedoe, 56, 2, (2014); Global Risk Governance Concept and Practice Using the Irgc Framework, (2008); Silver Bullet or Fools Gold A Global Review of Markets for Forest Environmental Services and their Impact on the Poor, (2002); Locatelli, Bruno, Impacts of payments for environmental services on local development in northern Costa Rica: A fuzzy multi-criteria analysis, Forest Policy and Economics, 10, 5, pp. 275-285, (2008); Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics, (1995); Social Impacts of Payments for Environmental Services in Costa Rica A Quantitative Field Survey and Analysis of the Virilla Watershed, (2003)","","Association of Japanese Geographers","","","","","","02896001","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099084793"

Results showed that transnational computer fraud in Vietnam occurs online and offline, with primary modus operandi including bank card fraud and phone scams. Moreover, the organizational structures of transnational computer fraud in Vietnam differ from those broadly assumed by scholars.

This study aimed to describe the general characteristics and high-risk behaviors of PNDWH and identify associated factors for adopting high-risk behaviors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Vietnam to explore the high-risk behaviors of 506 PNDWH. Associated factors were identified using multivariable logistic regressions. 83.2% of participants had sex without using a condom, and 27.9% had more than two sex partners. Among injected drug users, 44% had shared needles with an average number of 2.1 shared partners. Male, Kinh ethnicity (Vietnamese), high income, and high educational level were risk factors for high-risk behaviors. Our findings revealed the first time a comprehensive picture of PNDWH and emphasized the high prevalence of STIs, including untreated STIs and the long delay since the early HIV diagnosis.

The presence of nodes of subperiosteal new bone directly associated with superficial focal cavitations in a young adult male and a seven-year-old child are strongly diagnostic for treponemal disease. Climatic and epidemiological contexts suggest yaws (Treponema pallidum pertenue) as the most likely causative treponeme. This evidence is the oldest discovered in the Asia-Pacific region and is the first well-established pre-Columbian example in this region in terms of diagnosis and secure dating. The coastal ecology, sedentary settlement, and high fertility at the site of Man Bac all provided a biosocial context conducive to the spread of treponemal disease among inhabitants of the site. Co-morbidity with scurvy in both individuals demonstrates that malnutrition during the agricultural transition may have exacerbated the expression of treponematosis in this community. Man Bac is a site of great regional importance owing to its role during the Neolithic transition of Mainland Southeast Asia. During this transition, approximately 4,000 years ago, farmers migrating from southern China into Southeast Asia influenced a number of changes in subsistence and demography and potentially introduced new infectious diseases such as treponematosis to indigenous forager communities. The findings presented here may encourage reevaluation of existing Southeast Asian skeletal samples and demonstrate the importance of using weighted diagnostic criteria for future reporting of treponematosis cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Transition; Southeast Asia; Yaws","","","","aDepartment of Anatomy, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand bSchool of Archaeology and Anthropology, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia cSchool of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK dCollege of Medicine and Dentistry, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia eInstitute of Archaeology, Hanoi, Vietnam fSchool of Health Sciences, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan gOxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QY, UK hSchool of Social Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand *Correspondence to: Melandri Vlok, Department of Anatomy, University of Otago, 270 Great King Street, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand e-mail: Melandri.vlok@postgrad.otago.ac.nz This research was supported by a National Geographic Early Career Grant (EC-54332R-18), a Royal Society of New Zealand Skinner Fund Grant, and a University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship.","Acosta, Frank L., Diagnosis and management of adult pyogenic osteomyelitis of the cervical spine., Neurosurgical Focus, 17, 6, (2004); History of Human Life Span and Mortality, (1970); Akrawi, F., Is bejel syphilis?, British Journal of Venereal Diseases, 25, 3, pp. 115-123, (1949); Al-Shahed, Mona S., Imaging features of musculoskeletal brucellosis., Radiographics, 14, 2, pp. 333-348, (1994); Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture, (1984); Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, (2020); First Farmers the Origins of Agricultural Societies, (2005); Bellwood, Peter S., The expansions of farming societies and the role of the Neolithic demographic transition, pp. 13-34, (2008); SN Comprehensive Clinical Medicine, (2019); Brickley, Megan B., The Bioarchaeology of Metabolic Bone Disease, (2008)","","University of Florida Press","","","","","","24728349; 24728357","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160044101"

ASEAN has pre-existing cooperative frameworks in place, including regional health security measures, which, at least theoretically, could assist the region's efforts to formulate cooperative responses to containing a global pandemic. With its overarching “One Vision, One Identity, One Community”, ASEAN cooperation has extended to include region-wide disaster responses, framed as “One Asean, One Response”.

Particularly, communities in isolated riverine islands are heavily affected due to their poor adaptive capacities, which is well documented in the contemporary literature. The focal point for the vulnerability of these people lies in the water resources (drinking water availability, agricultural water quality, salt-water intrusion, flooding etc.) and the future interaction between human and water systems. This paper advocates the importance of socio-hydrological research in the context of enhancing social adaptive capacity as well as for developing a resilient water environment in three very large riverine islands in Asia: Fraserganj (India), Dakshin Bedkashi (Bangladesh) (both from the Ganges-Brahaputra-Meghna Delta) and Con Dao Island (Mekong River, Vietnam). It also explores how the nexus of human–water relations could be applied to improve adaptive measures to manage local water needs while mitigating undesirable changes to the hydrological cycle. Socio-hydrological models as an integrated tool can be used to quantify the feedbacks between water resources and society at multiple scales, with the aim of expediting stakeholder participation for sustainable water resource management. The proposed idea in this study will be helpful to sketch projections of alternatives that explicitly account for plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological system, which will yield both insights into cause–effect relationships and help stakeholders to identify safe functioning space. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Global Change; Riverine Islands; Socio-hydrology; Adaptive Management; Environmental Change; Flooding; Global Change; Research Work; River System; Socioeconomic Conditions; Stakeholder; Urbanization; Vulnerability; Water Resource; Water Stress; Bangladesh; Con Dao Islands; India; Mekong River; Viet Nam","adaptive management; environmental change; flooding; global change; research work; river system; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; urbanization; vulnerability; water resource; water stress; Bangladesh; Con Dao Islands; India; Mekong River; Viet Nam","","","This work is supported by Asia Pacific Network (APN) Collaborative Regional Research Programme ( CRRP ) project with project reference number CRRP2019-01MY-Kumar .","Arnell, Nigel W., The impacts of climate change on river flow regimes at the global scale, Journal of Hydrology, 486, pp. 351-364, (2013); Di Baldassarre, Giuliano, Debates - Perspectives on socio-hydrology: Capturing feedbacks between physical and social processes, Water Resources Research, 51, 6, pp. 4770-4781, (2015); Int J Recent Sci Res, (2018); Bhatia, Kieran T., Recent increases in tropical cyclone intensification rates, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Blair, Peter, Socio-hydrological modelling: A review asking ""why, what and how?, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 20, 1, pp. 443-478, (2016); Journal of Vietnamese Environment, (2014); Dasgupta, Rajarshi, Implication and management of coastal salinity for sustainable community livelihood: Case study from the Indian Sundarban Delta, pp. 251-269, (2018); undefined, (2015); Dubey, Sourabh Kumar, Evaluation on the prevailing aquaculture practices in the Indian Sundarban delta: An insight analysis, Journal of Food, Agriculture and Environment, 14, 2, pp. 133-141, (2016); Emch, Michael E., Local environmental predictors of cholera in Bangladesh and Vietnam, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 78, 5, pp. 823-832, (2008)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","25900617","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096721362"

By employing village-census panel data from original household surveys, our investigation shows that, while agricultural extension service motivated farmers to adopt the new rice variety in the initial period, information sharing among the peers facilitated further adoption in the following period. After an early boost from agricultural extension services, adoption largely took place through social learning among the peers. Social networks of the wives had a greater influence on new rice variety adoption than those of the husbands. By applying the combination of the difference-in-differences method and propensity score weighted regression, our results show that the new rice variety adoption improved productivity and reduced pesticide use.

In the solution, floodwater from the Red River is discharged through the Van Coc Gate, with an overflow point into Van Coc Lake, and is drained downstream through the Day Weir. However, an optimal scenario for the operating procedure of the emergency solution, based on a comprehensive evaluation of the flood risk level from the Red River to the residential areas located outside the protected areas of the dike system, has not been adequately addressed to date. In this study, we employed the latest digital elevation map in a high spatial resolution for the first time, and a two-dimensional depth-integrated hydrodynamic model was utilised to obtain the optimal operation for the emergency solution. The optimal scenario was determined to minimise the flood risk level to the residential areas and optimise the inflow discharge at the Van Coc Gate and the overflow point, and the outflow discharge at the Day Weir for ensuring the safety of the operating system.

In this study of Vietnamese folktales, through the use of Bayesian multilevel modeling and the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we offer empirical evidence for how the interplay between religious teachings (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) and deviant behaviors (lying and violence) could affect a folktale’s outcome. The findings indicate that characters who lie and/or commit violent acts tend to have bad endings, as intuition would dictate, but when they are associated with any of the above Three Teachings, the final endings may vary. Positive outcomes are seen in cases where characters associated with Confucianism lie and characters associated with Buddhism act violently. The results supplement the worldwide literature on discrepancies between folklore and real-life conduct, as well as on the contradictory human behaviors vis-à-vis religious teachings. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of human decision-making, especially beyond the folklore realm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abello, James, Computational folkloristics, Communications of the ACM, 55, 7, pp. 60-70, (2012); Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, (1977); Revista Alicantina De Estudios Ingleses, (2010); Int J Stud Engl Lang Lit, (2014); Atran, Scott, The devoted actor: Unconditional commitment and intractable conflict across cultures, Current Anthropology, 57, pp. S192-S203, (2016); Journal of American Folklore, (1954); Benda, Brent B., Religion and violent offenders in boot camp: A structural equation model, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 39, 1, pp. 91-121, (2002); Bersoff, David M., Why good people sometimes do bad things: Motivated reasoning and unethical behavior, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, 1, pp. 28-39, (1999); Bi, Lijun, The doctrine of filial piety: A philosophical analysis of the concealment case, Journal of Chinese Philosophy, 31, 4, pp. 451-467, (2004); Blogowska, Joanna, Religious prosociality and aggression: It's real, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 52, 3, pp. 524-536, (2013)","","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

The area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham Marine Protected Area (MPA), central Vietnam, has been reported to be declining in recent years. However, there has not been any study on assessing the changes in the area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham MPA, especially by the application of remote sensing technology for evaluating temporal and spatial changes. The aim of this study is to establish the current status and document historical changes using maps of seagrass area in Cu Lao Cham MPA, central Vietnam, during the period of 2003–2017. This is the first study on assessing the temporal and spatial changes in the area of seagrass beds in central Vietnam using remote sensing technology. The study integrated field surveys, satellite remote sensing and GIS methods to analyse ALOS AVNIR-2 and Landsat satellite image data during the period of 2003–2017. The Kappa coefficients and overall accuracies of the years 2003, 2010 and 2017 were generally higher than 89% and 0.83, respectively, in all cases. Seagrass beds have mainly distributed near small islands such as Hon La, Hon Tai and Hon Dai. In particular, seagrass beds have almost disappeared at Bai Ong and Bai Huong in April 2017. In the period of 2003–2017, the area of the seagrass bed experienced significant changes. The seagrass area loss was 40.17 ha, and it gained 58.6 ha in the period of 2003–2010. In the period of 2010–2017, the loss of seagrass area was 68.76 ha, and the new addition was 7.27 ha. The study has identified a number of impacts of declining seagrass areas including marine pollution, changes in natural conditions and some other direct impacts from human activities and tourism. The results of this study could contribute to conservation of seagrass resources and sustainable livelihood development for the local community. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Landsat; Marine Protected Area; Remote Sensing; Seagrass; Temporal And Spatial Changes; Accuracy Assessment; Alos; Gis; Landsat; Marine Pollution; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Seagrass; Viet Nam","accuracy assessment; ALOS; GIS; Landsat; marine pollution; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seagrass; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (Nafosted) under Grant No. 106.06-2017.340 and the Global School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University’s Seeds Funding programme for construction of global environmental study basis (2018–2019).

Studies have yet to investigate not only the institutional factors affecting VietGAHP adoption in household pig farming, but also the impact of such adoption on its criteria’ implementation. The objective of this study is to investigate the factors associated with VietGAHP adoption in household pig production and its impact on implementing its criteria. A Probit model was used to directly indicate the determinants of VietGAHP adoption, and a z test revealed the VietGAHP’s impact by comparing the differences in each criterion’s compliance rates between adopter and non-adopter groups. The results demonstrate that the factors positively contributing to VietGAHP adoption include gender, training, household income, and veterinary services, with the training factor as a substantial contributor. The factors presenting a challenge to this adoption included farm size, the number of family members participating in pig-raising, off-farm income, and biogas, with the latter an especially pivotal factor. Moreover, an expected result of the government’s support was that VietGAHP adoption had a positive impact on 9 out 15 compulsory practices and 8 of 14 optional practices. These imply that to attain food safety and environmental protection goals through a public GAP program for pig production, traditional adoption factors—including a male farmer status, training, household wealth, and veterinary services—remain key pillars on which government policies should focus. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compliance; Household; Pig Production; Public Good Agricultural Practices; Vietgahp Adoption; Vietnam; Biogas; Compliance; Environmental Protection; Farm Size; Food Safety; Household Structure; Numerical Model; Pig; Policy Making; Animalia; Suidae","biogas; compliance; environmental protection; farm size; food safety; household structure; numerical model; pig; policy making; Animalia; Suidae","","","This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H00960.","Amekawa, Yuichiro, Reflections on the growing influence of good agricultural practices in the Global South, Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 22, 6, pp. 531-557, (2009); Asfaw, Solomon, Impact of modern agricultural technologies on smallholder welfare: Evidence from Tanzania and Ethiopia, Food Policy, 37, 3, pp. 283-295, (2012); Baumgart-Getz, Adam, Why farmers adopt best management practice in the United States: A meta-analysis of the adoption literature, Journal of Environmental Management, 96, 1, pp. 17-25, (2012); Coulibaly, Jeanne Y., Adoption of agroforestry and the impact on household food security among farmers in Malawi, Agricultural Systems, 155, pp. 52-69, (2017); Feder, Gershon, Adoption of agricultural innovations in developing countries: a survey., Economic Development and Cultural Change, 33, 2, pp. 255-298, (1985); Ghimire, Raju, Factors Affecting Adoption of Improved Rice Varieties among Rural Farm Households in Central Nepal, Rice Science, 22, 1, pp. 35-43, (2015); Journal of Economics and Developments, (2016); Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2007, (2008); Results of the Rural Agricultural and Fishery Census 2016, (2018); Incentives for the Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices, (2003)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V. editorial@springerplus.com","","","","","","15732975; 1387585X","","EDSNB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075984425"

Since the output quality of PV depends mainly on the solar irradiation and cell temperature, modeling the I-V relationship regarding solar irradiation and cell temperature need to be addressed. In this paper, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is adopted to forecast the solar irradiation and temperature of a PV module. After that, a PV module model called one-diode model is introduced to identify the I-V characteristic of the PV module, which only employs the data forecasted by the LSTM-based model and the manufactured data. Since this method combines the strengths of two techniques, it solves the uncertainty of meteorological data as well as provides an effective method to model the I-V output quality of the PV module. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; I-v Characteristic; Long Short-term Memory (lstm); One-diode Model (odm); Photovoltaic Module; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Irradiation; Long Short-term Memory; Meteorology; Numerical Methods; Photovoltaic Cells; Smart Power Grids; Solar Cells; Solar Radiation; Cell Temperature; Diode Modeling; Iv Characteristics; Meteorological Data; Output Quality; Photovoltaic Systems; Real Operating Conditions; Solar Irradiation; Deep Learning","Electric power transmission networks; Irradiation; Long short-term memory; Meteorology; Numerical methods; Photovoltaic cells; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Solar radiation; Cell temperature; Diode modeling; IV characteristics; Meteorological data; Output quality; Photovoltaic systems; Real operating conditions; Solar irradiation; Deep learning","","","","Lo Brano, Valerio, An improved five-parameter model for photovoltaic modules, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 94, 8, pp. 1358-1370, (2010); Laudani, Antonino, Identification of the one-diode model for photovoltaic modules from datasheet values, Solar Energy, 108, pp. 432-446, (2014); Chen, Yujie, An improved explicit double-diode model of solar cells: Fitness verification and parameter extraction, Energy Conversion and Management, 169, pp. 345-358, (2018); Almonacid Cruz, Florencia M., Characterisation of Si-crystalline PV modules by artificial neural networks, Renewable Energy, 34, 4, pp. 941-949, (2009); Yang, Xiuyuan, Day-ahead forecasting of photovoltaic output power with similar cloud space fusion based on incomplete historical data mining, Applied Energy, 206, pp. 683-696, (2017); Theocharides, Spyros, Day-ahead photovoltaic power production forecasting methodology based on machine learning and statistical post-processing, Applied Energy, 268, (2020); Yagli, Gokhan Mert, Automatic hourly solar forecasting using machine learning models, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 105, pp. 487-498, (2019); Moghaddam Nia, Alireza, Comparison of LLR, MLP, Elman, NNARX and ANFIS Models-with a case study in solar radiation estimation, Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 71, 8-9, pp. 975-982, (2009); Alzahrani, Ahmad S., Solar Irradiance Forecasting Using Deep Neural Networks, Procedia Computer Science, 114, pp. 304-313, (2017); Wang, Dingcheng, Air temperature prediction based on EMD and LS-SVM, pp. 177-180, (2010)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Murdoch University","2020 International Conference on Smart Grids and Energy Systems, SGES 2020","","Virtual, Perth; WA","167695","","9781728185507","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102779252"

The radiation sensitivities of dormant conidium-, germinating conidium-, and mycelium-contaminated wet and dry paper were also determined. A radiation dose capable of inactivating 50% of a 30-sample population was used for comparison. Our results showed that the 50% inactivation dose did not significantly differ between wet and dry dormant conidia. However, the survival percentage of dry dormant conidia was higher than that of wet dormant conidia at a high radiation dose. In contrast, the 50% inactivation doses for dry germinating conidia and dry mycelia were significantly lower than those for wet germinating conidia and wet mycelia, respectively. These results indicate that drought stress increased the radiation sensitivity of germinating conidia and mycelia. We also investigated the mechanical properties of Kohzo-gami irradiated at different doses. The order of the tensile strength of Kohzo-gami relative to that of control samples was as follows: 10 kGy > 30 kGy > 40 kGy. This result suggests that even a 10 kGy radiation dose can affect the mechanical properties of paper. The color change level of Kohzo-gami increased significantly at all doses; however, the National Bureau of Standards rating showed only “slight change” at all doses. The radiation doses required for fungal disinfection varied considerably depending on the fungal species and the total number of fungal cells on contaminated paper. Therefore, it was difficult to determine the standard exposure dose for treatment. However, paper sterilization might not be required, as a combination of low-dose radiation and dryness can effectively kill fungal mycelia on contaminated paper. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conidium; Fungal Contamination; Gamma Irradiation; Japanese Paper; Mycelium","","","","Part of this research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 19H05457 ].","Curr Med Mycol, (2016); Borchers, Andrea T., Mold and Human Health: a Reality Check, Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology, 52, 3, pp. 305-322, (2017); Bratu, Eugen, Archives decontamination by gamma irradiation, Nukleonika, 54, 2, pp. 77-84, (2009); González, María E., Gamma radiation for preservation of biologically damaged paper, Radiation Physics and Chemistry, 63, 3-6, pp. 263-265, (2002); da Silva, Manuela, Inactivation of fungi from deteriorated paper materials by radiation, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation, 57, 3, pp. 163-167, (2006); CHoi, Jong-il, Effect of radiation on disinfection and mechanical properties of Korean traditional paper, Hanji, Radiation Physics and Chemistry, 81, 8, pp. 1051-1054, (2012); Sterflinger, Katja, The revenge of time: Fungal deterioration of cultural heritage with particular reference to books, paper and parchment, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 3, pp. 559-566, (2012); Sato, Yoshinori, Microbial deterioration of tsunami-affected paper-based objects: A case study, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation, 88, pp. 142-149, (2014); Cbs Laboratory Manual Series, (2010); Kumeda, Yuko, Heteroduplex Panel Analysis, a Novel Method for Genetic Identification of Aspergillus Section Flavi Strains, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 67, 9, pp. 4084-4090, (2001)","","Elsevier Masson s.r.l.","","","","","","12962074","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088966606"

Hokkaido, the biggest island situated to the north of Japan, has a lower frequency of earthquakes and tsunamis compared to other parts of the country. Nevertheless, the occurrence of the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake in September 2018 raised important awareness in the local community of the tsunami threat. In this study we aim to examine the behavior in response to the potential of a tsunami in the city of Muroran, a community with an aging population. Our results highlight that the increase in age, homeownership, and living alone negatively impact the act and intention of evacuation. By contrast, collecting information, dwelling location, perceived seismic intensity, reserving tools and food, and post-earthquake action positively influences evacuation behavior. Remarkably, grasping news and age have the strongest impacts, while house location, shock intensity, preparedness of emergency tools, and post-earthquake actions respectively, have a medium effect on people's behavior. The lowest influence variables are homeownership status, food stocking, and living alone.

Among them, the SWAT calibration and uncertainty program (SWAT-CUP) with sequential uncertainty fitting 2 (SUFI-2) algorithm is widely used and several objective functions have been implemented in its calibration process. In this study, eight different objective functions were used in a calibration of stream flow of the Pursat River Basin of Cambodia, a tropical monsoon and forested watershed, to examine their influences on the calibration results, parameter optimizations, and water resources estimations. As results, many objective functions performed better than satisfactory in calibrating the SWAT model. However, different objective functions defined different fitted values and sensitivity rank of the calibrated parameters, except Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and ratio of standard deviation of observations to root mean square error (RSR) which are equivalent and produced quite identical simulation results including parameter sensitivity and fitted parameter values, leading to the same water balance components and water yields estimations. As they generated reasonable fitted parameter values, either NSE or RSR gave better estimation results of annual average water yield and other water balance components such as annual average evapotranspiration, groundwater flow, surface runoff, and lateral flow according to the characteristics of the river basin and the results and data of previous studies. Moreover, either of them was also better in calibrating base flow, falling limb, and overall the entire flow phases of the hydrograph in this area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calibration; Objective Functions; Sufi-2; Swat Model; Water Balance Components; Calibration; Groundwater; Groundwater Flow; Mean Square Error; Parameter Estimation; Runoff; Stream Flow; Surface Water Resources; Watersheds; Calibration Techniques; Parameter Optimization; Parameter Sensitivities; Root Mean Square Errors; Sequential Uncertainty Fittings; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Water Balance Analysis; Water Balance Components; Rivers; Calibration; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; River Basin; Runoff; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Streamflow; Water Budget; Cambodia","Calibration; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Runoff; Stream flow; Surface water resources; Watersheds; Calibration techniques; Parameter optimization; Parameter sensitivities; Root mean square errors; Sequential uncertainty fittings; Soil and water assessment tool; Water balance analysis; Water balance components; Rivers; calibration; evapotranspiration; groundwater; river basin; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water budget; Cambodia","","","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP18H02295.","Gosain, Ashvani Kumar, Climate change impact assessment on hydrology of Indian river basins, Current Science, 90, 3, pp. 346-353, (2006); Rostamian, Rokhsareh, Application of a SWAT model for estimating runoff and sediment in two mountainous basins in central Iran, Hydrological Sciences Journal, 53, 5, pp. 977-988, (2008); Huang, Thomas C., Effects of land use change on sediment and water yields in yang ming shan national park, taiwan, Environments - MDPI, 2, 1, pp. 32-42, (2015); Näschen, Kristian, The Impact of Land Use/Land Cover Change (LULCC) on Water Resources in a Tropical Catchment in Tanzania under Different Climate Change Scenarios, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 24, (2019); Cambien, Naomi, Using the soil and water assessment tool to simulate the pesticide dynamics in the data scarce guayas River Basin, Ecuador, Water (Switzerland), 12, 3, pp. 1-21, (2020); Arnold, Jeffrey G., Large area hydrologic modeling and assessment part I: Model development, Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 34, 1, pp. 73-89, (1998); Arnold, Jeffrey G., SWAT: Model use, calibration, and validation, Transactions of the ASABE, 55, 4, pp. 1491-1508, (2012); Soil and Water Assessment Tool Theoretical Documentation Version 2000, (2002); Gassman, Philip Walter, The soil and water assessment tool: Historical development, applications, and future research directions, Transactions of the ASABE, 50, 4, pp. 1211-1250, (2007); Abbaspour, Karim C., A continental-scale hydrology and water quality model for Europe: Calibration and uncertainty of a high-resolution large-scale SWAT model, Journal of Hydrology, 524, pp. 733-752, (2015)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095968130"

This study aims at investigating the modernization of its entire swine-to-pork value chain. Design/methodology/approach: This study combines the secondary data and primary data. The secondary data included the publications, procurements, databases from both worldwide and in Vietnam. Primary data comprised the results from field-trips in March 2018 and February 2019 that used in-depth interviews with representative key persons of involving stake-holders. Findings: The prevalence of contract farming, vertical expansion and conglomerate mergers mainly boost vertical coordination in the industry, which creates three hierarchy paradigms of governance named the full- and semi-vertically integrated model, and the formal coordinating relation institution. Consequently, consolidation has occurred and lead the swine and pork value chain toward modernization. Research limitations/implications: This study generalizes its first trends of the modernization of the swine-to-pork industry instead of provides its concreted impacts to the involved stakeholders. Social implications: Swine and pork industries retain historical and socio-political issues in Vietnam. Social problems are going to raise if number of traditional swine producers are failed in the competition from the equipped large-scale producers leading by the giant vertically-integrated contractors. Originality/value: This study provides the empirical synthesis of the vertical coordination in entitle swine and pork value chain of Vietnam through combining the view of the strategic alliance of the firm and global value chain governance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consolidation; Contract Farming; Coordination; Pig; Pork; Value Chain; Vertical Integration; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: Authors would like to especially thank the anonymous reviewers for the constructive comments this manuscript.

This study focuses on the connection of three main process components (husbandry-crop-fishpond) in a typical farming household located within an acid soil region of rural Vietnam. The concept of exergy analysis is used to underline the potential for resource efficiency in alternative processes in the agricultural system. For development of an integrated ecological system aiming towards zero emissions, the analytical methods of material cycles and energy flows utilized a set of indicators of resource efficiency in a sustainable agriculture. Results: The design of the ideal integrated farming system ""Agro-Industrial Zero Emissions Systems""(AIZES) can increase the system efficiency by making use of indigenous natural materials and waste reuse/recycling. Recycling waste produce energy, fish feed and fertilizer can result in a decreased environmental load of approximately half. Using exergy analysis to calculate an indicator non-renewable yield ratio (NRYR), the systems verified sustainability of agriculture production. Conclusions: The farming household will be able to subsidize their fuel and electricity consumption by utilizing biogas. Surplus biogas will be distributed to proximate households, further creating sustainable goals. Biochar, created by mixing the biomass residues with local plants, will improve soil quality and pig sludge, mixed with biomass residue, will create high-quality fertilizer. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acid Sulphate Soil; Agricultural System; Biogas; Exergy Efficiency; Zero Emissions; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Biogas; Exergy; Fertilizers; Industrial Emissions; Mammals; Soils; Sustainable Development; Agricultural System; Agriculture Productions; Alternative Process; Electricity-consumption; Environmental Loads; Integrated Farming Systems; Resource Efficiencies; Sustainable Agriculture; Energy Efficiency; Acid Soil; Acid Sulfate Soil; Agricultural Ecosystem; Biogas; Energy Efficiency; Integrated Approach; Recycling; Soil Emission; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Suidae","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biogas; Exergy; Fertilizers; Industrial emissions; Mammals; Soils; Sustainable development; Agricultural system; Agriculture productions; Alternative process; Electricity-consumption; Environmental loads; Integrated farming systems; Resource efficiencies; Sustainable agriculture; Energy efficiency; acid soil; acid sulfate soil; agricultural ecosystem; biogas; energy efficiency; integrated approach; recycling; soil emission; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Suidae","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) under the grant number KC08.19/16-20.","Neori, Amir, Development of polyculture and integrated multi - trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in Israel: A review, Israeli Journal of Aquaculture - Bamidgeh, 69, (2017); van Huong, Nguyen Thi, Efficiency of different integrated agriculture aquaculture systems in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 2, (2018); Energy Saving Measures in Agriculture Overview on the Basis of National Reports, (2012); Sustainability and Society 2013, (2013); Vigne, Mathieu, Evaluating the ability of current energy use assessment methods to study contrasting livestock production systems, Journal of Environmental Management, 112, pp. 199-212, (2012); Tucho, Gudina Terefe, Alternative energy supply system to a rural village in Ethiopia, Energy, Sustainability and Society, 7, 1, (2017); Insights to the Internal Sphere of Influence of Peasant Family Farms in Using Biogas Plants as Part of Sustainable Development in Rural Areas of Germany, (2012); Daniel-Gromke, Jaqueline, Digestion of bio-waste - GHG emissions and mitigation potential, Energy, Sustainability and Society, 5, 1, pp. 1-12, (2015); Muvhiiwa, Ralph, The impact and challenges of sustainable biogas implementation: moving towards a bio-based economy, Energy, Sustainability and Society, 7, 1, (2017); Etsay, Haftu, Returns, setbacks, and future prospects of bio-energy promotion in northern Ethiopia: The case of family-sized biogas energy, Energy, Sustainability and Society, 8, 1, (2018)","","BioMed Central Ltd info@biomedcentral.com","","","","","","21920567","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092426742"

This paper selects the panel data of 12 resource-based industries in China from 2003 to 2019 and tests the impact of environmental regulation on technological innovation of resource-based industries by constructing the econometric model. The results show that environmental regulation can promote the technological innovation of resource-based industries. Specifically, environmental regulation has no significant positive impact on the immediate product innovation of 12 resource-based industries in China, but it has a significant positive impact on the product innovation lagging behind one period and two periods. Environmental regulation has no significant impact on the process innovation of current period, but has a significant positive impact on the process innovation of lagging one period. Industrial scale has a significant positive impact on product innovation of resource-based industries. The input of scientific and technological activity personnel has a significant positive impact on the product innovation of current period, and in the long run, it promotes both product innovation and process innovation. On this basis, this paper puts forward the relevant measures and suggestions for the formulation of environmental regulation policies. The government departments should subdivide the resource-based industries, formulate environmental rules and policies by classification, encourage industrial enterprises to carry out technological innovation, reasonably implement fiscal and taxation policy tools and increase the investment in R&D funds, and improve the training mechanism of scientific and technological personnel. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Regulation; Resource-based Industry; Technological Innovation; Innovation; Panel Data; Policy Approach; Policy Implementation; Training; China","innovation; panel data; policy approach; policy implementation; training; China","","","At the same time, relying on technological innovation and cooperation to deal with climate change has become an international consensus. Due to the complexity of climate change, many governments have adopted mitigation and application mechanisms; however, the research in this area is scattered and uncoordinated. Some survey found that government subsidies were not the biggest driving force in most industries, while voluntary agreements were the biggest driving force for the introduction of environmental innovation in the manufacturing industry. The United Nations and other countries in the world fight against the effects of climate change through mitigation technology measures. Due to the externality of climate governance, the development of new technologies needs a lot of financial support from the government. Most of the EUs R&D funding for low-carbon energy technologies comes from public funding from the EU Member States. Qin et al. found that a country’s propensity for climate technology innovation was affected by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions [20]. For the research on the relationship among government policies, environmental protection technology, and greenhouse gas emissions, the existing literature is conducted from the perspective of government supporting technological innovation to influence climate change [21–25]. However, will climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions affect the innovation of ecological technology? The existing research in this area is still very rare.","Journal of Economic Perspectives, (1995); Earth Scan in Business and the Environment, (1996); American Economic Review, (1987); Res Financ Econ Issues, (2015); Ecol Econ, (2007); Dam, Lammertjan, The curse of the haven: The impact of multinational enterprise on environmental regulation, Ecological Economics, 78, pp. 148-156, (2012); Acemoglu, Daron, The environment and directed technical change, American Economic Review, 102, 1, pp. 131-166, (2012); Science Research Management, (2011); Horbach, Jens, Determinants of eco-innovations by type of environmental impact - The role of regulatory push/pull, technology push and market pull, Ecological Economics, 78, pp. 112-122, (2012); Yang, Biingshiunn, The impact of uncertain environmental regulatory policy on optimal plant location and anti-pollution technology selection, Annals of Regional Science, 50, 3, pp. 753-769, (2013)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097586313"

All nations and communities have applied many countermeasures to control the spread of the epidemic. In terms of countermeasures, lockdowns and reductions of social activities are meant to flatten the curve of infection. Nevertheless, to date, there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods. Thus, the present study aims to interpret the change in the population density of Sapporo city in the emergency's period declaration using big data obtained from mobile spatial statistics. The results indicate that, in the time of refraining from traveling, the city's residents have been more likely to stay home and less likely to travel to the center area. This has led to a decrease of up to 90% of the population density in crowded areas. The study's outcomes partly explain the statement of reducing 70%–80% of contact between people in line with the purpose of the emergency declaration.

The serious challenges of MIS include low water use efficiency and limited available water resources. The objective of this study is to analyze the current and future irrigation water resource availability for the improvement of future water management. A Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a public domain software supported by the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service in Bushland, TX, USA, was used to estimate the current and future water resources availability from the MIS's main irrigation water supply sources (River Thiba and River Nyamindi). CropWat, a computer program developed by the Land and Water Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Rome, Italy, was used to estimate irrigation water requirements from 2013-2016 and into the future (2020-2060 and 2061-2099). Future climatic data for total available flow and irrigation requirement estimations were downloaded from three General Circulation Models (GCMs). The data was bias corrected and down-scaled (with observed data) using a Climate Change Toolkit, a toolkit for climate change analysis developed by the Water Weather and Energy Ecosystem, Zurich, Switzerland. The results indicated that the highest irrigation water deficits were experienced in July and August based on the existing cropping pattern. Under a proposed future pattern, estimates show that MIS will experience water deficits mainly from June to October and from January to February. This study recommends that MIS management should put into strong consideration the simulated future estimates in irrigation water availability for the improvement of water management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Swat; Water Resources Availability; Agricultural Robots; Irrigation; Open Source Software; Soil Moisture; Water Management; Water Supply; Agricultural Research Services; Food And Agriculture Organizations; General Circulation Model; Irrigation Requirements; Irrigation Water Requirements; Soil Water Assessment Tool; United States Department Of Agricultures; Water Resources Availability; Climate Change; Cereal; Climate Change; Irrigation System; Resource Availability; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Water Management; Water Resource; Water Use; Bushland; Italy; Kenya; Kirinyaga; Lazio; Mwea; Roma [lazio]; Rome; Texas; United States; Zurich","Agricultural robots; Irrigation; Open source software; Soil moisture; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural Research Services; Food and agriculture organizations; General circulation model; Irrigation requirements; Irrigation water requirements; Soil water assessment tool; United states department of agricultures; Water resources availability; Climate change; cereal; climate change; irrigation system; resource availability; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; water management; water resource; water use; Bushland; Italy; Kenya; Kirinyaga; Lazio; Mwea; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; Texas; United States; Zurich","","","Acknowledgments: The author gratefully acknowledges the technical staff at the Mwea Irrigation Scheme, resident engineers at the Thiba Dam project, Water Resources Management Authority (Kenya) for their all rounded support and cooperation in availing the necessary data and support during the fieldwork studies.

Hanoi was selected as a case study to examine the current situation of food waste generated by consumers through daily habits/practices and to evaluate options for preventing and reducing food waste at the policy level through a literature/policy review and interview-style survey. An analysis of responses found that the self-reported food waste generation rate in Hanoi averaged 1192 g/day/household in urban areas and 1694 g/day/household in rural areas; cooking waste generated during meal processing/preparation accounts for more than 70% of the total; less than 20% of respondents separated out kitchen waste for reuse/recycling before disposal; expiration dates and deteriorating quality were cited as primary reasons for food waste at home in contrast with larger portions and over-ordering outside the home; leftover food is used indirectly as animal feed in urban areas and directly in rural areas; and most respondents indicate a willingness to reduce, reuse, and recycle food waste. To achieve SDG target 12.3, policymakers and practitioners must develop comprehensive food waste policies and actions targeting the entire supply chain, implement practical food waste management systems, and promote sufficiency strategies for saving food, reducing food waste, and maintaining health and well-being. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Food Waste; Hanoi; Households; Lifestyle; Sdgs; Domestic Waste; Policy Analysis; Qualitative Analysis; Questionnaire Survey; Supply Chain Management; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Area; Waste Management; Willingness To Pay; Hanoi; Viet Nam; Animalia","domestic waste; policy analysis; qualitative analysis; questionnaire survey; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal; urban area; waste management; willingness to pay; Hanoi; Viet Nam; Animalia","","","Funding: This research was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-16) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan “Policy Design and Evaluation to Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns in the Asian Region” (2016–2020), and the IGES SRF Fund 2020.","State of Food and Agriculture 2019 Moving Forward on Food Loss and Waste Reduction, (2019); Beretta, Claudio, Quantifying food losses and the potential for reduction in Switzerland, Waste Management, 33, 3, pp. 764-773, (2013); Food Wastage Footprint Climate Change, (2015); Food Wastage Footprint Full Cost Accounting, (2014); State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015 Meeting the 2015 International Hunger Targets Taking Stock of Uneven Progress, (2015); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2025); Poore, Joseph, Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers, Science, 360, 6392, pp. 987-992, (2018); Global Food Losses and Food Waste, (2011); Fusions Definitional Framework for Food Waste, (2014); Schneider, Felicitas, Review of food waste prevention on an international level, Proceedings of Institution of Civil Engineers: Waste and Resource Management, 166, 4, pp. 187-203, (2013)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089852708"

In the forecasting process, the effects of social interactions on individual choices are attracting considerable attention. Traditionally, these interactions have been evaluated in the relationship between the individual's behavior and the group's behavior. Conformity has thus become a central issue in this interaction for its mass effect. In the case of PT usage, an individual will have a higher propensity for PT usage when more people in his/her preference group use it. This study shows the need to add an issue, in-vehicle congestion, to the interaction analysis. When more people use PT, occupancy increases and the vehicles become congested, making PT a less attractive option. Both the positive mass effect of conformity and the negative mass effect of in-vehicle congestion on individual choices of PT usage were addressed using an equilibrium calculation based on the estimated utility function of PT usage. For the new PT system to be constructed in Ho Chi Minh City, usage proportions for student, company employee, and government employee groups were estimated of 19.6%, 10.4%, and 10.2%, respectively. A congestion ratio of 61% was found to be the social equilibrium of PT usage and of travel demand for commuting trips by PT. These findings provide an improved, practical picture of the future usage of the new PT system, which is beneficial to effective policymaking and planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Equilibrium; Mass Effects; Public Transportation; Social Interaction; Forecasting; Personnel; Traffic Congestion; Vehicles; Demand Forecast; Equilibrium Calculation; Government Employees; Individual Choice; Interaction Analysis; Public Transportation; Social Interactions; Utility Functions; Mass Transportation; Demand Analysis; Forecasting Method; Numerical Model; Policy Making; Public Transport; Transportation Planning; Transportation Policy; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam","Forecasting; Personnel; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Demand forecast; Equilibrium calculation; Government employees; Individual choice; Interaction analysis; Public transportation; Social interactions; Utility functions; Mass transportation; demand analysis; forecasting method; numerical model; policy making; public transport; transportation planning; transportation policy; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam","","","","Abou-Zeid, Maya, Mass effects and mobility decisions, Transportation Letters, 5, 3, pp. 115-130, (2013); Barthélémy, Marc, A global take on congestion in urban areas, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 43, 5, pp. 800-804, (2016); Batarce, Marco, Use of mixed stated and revealed preference data for crowding valuation on public transport in Santiago, Chile, Transportation Research Record, 2535, pp. 73-78, (2015); Batarce, Marco, Valuing crowding in public transport: Implications for cost-benefit analysis, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 91, pp. 358-378, (2016); Discrete Choice Analysis Theory and Application to Travel Demand, (1985); Journal of Transport Economics and Policy, (1988); Brock, William A., Discrete choice with social interactions, Review of Economic Studies, 68, 2, pp. 235-260, (2001); Chatterjee, Arun, Non-commitment bias in public opinion on transit usage, Transportation, 11, 4, pp. 347-360, (1983); undefined, (2000); undefined, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","13619209","","TRDTF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088135780"

We examine the case of a rubber plantation in an ethnic minority area in the Northwest of the country. In doing so, the paper seeks to address how the Vietnamese socialist State – often considered a ‘strong state’ because it has pursued egalitarian land distribution policies over the past three decades – proceeds with domestic land grabbing in a context where the local people follow customary land use practices. The field research revealed the following. First, the Vietnamese government, while maintaining land distribution policies for its rural farming population, has increasingly sought to bring these policies more in line with the global trend of large-scale land acquisition at the expense of the traditional interests and livelihoods of the local population. By seeking to justify their essentially non-egalitarian land grab processes through the policy of post-land grab ‘egalitarian land re-distributions’ in areas with disembedded customary control, the domestic state actors deployed a cunning duplicity in their persistent adherence to agrarian egalitarianism. Second, with the supports from the local and central governments, a state-owned enterprise named Vietnam Rubber Group, carved out its land grab processes with more freedom, leverage, and power than similar firms investing abroad through land concessions. Last, the post-land grab redistribution of land rights materializes state formation through re-territorialization of and re-legalization within the frontier zone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestic Land Grab; Egalitarian Land Distribution; Rubber Plantation; State-owned Enterprise; Vietnam; Land Management; Land Rights; Land Use Planning; Plantation; Policy Approach; Rubber; State Owned Enterprise; Viet Nam","land management; land rights; land use planning; plantation; policy approach; rubber; state owned enterprise; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the Vietnamese Government for providing scholarship to the first author’s Ph.D. program at the Kyushu University.

On one hand, renewable energies have turned to the first choice of system operators. On the other hand, the system should provide the required infrastructure to appropriately accommodate such energy sources. In this respect, microgrids (MG) would provide the needed conditions for integrating renewable energy sources (RESs). Thus, the optimal energy management of such systems in the presence of highly uncertain renewable power generation is of great importance. Accordingly, this paper provides a stochastic programming framework for the optimal scheduling of an MG equipped with RESs and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The power sources considered include a wind energy system in the form of wind turbine (WT), a solar photovoltaic (PV) system, a fuel cell (FC), a microturbine (MT), besides a battery storage system (BSS). The mentioned problem is formulated as a single-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing the total operating cost over the scheduling period. The MG is considered in the grid-connected mode where it can transact power with the upstream system. The uncertainty of the problem is due to the intermittent power output of the wind energy system and the PV unit, as well as uncertain behavior of the EV owners in charging/discharging their vehicles. The proposed stochastic optimization problem is the solved using an effective and efficient optimization algorithm named “modified harmony search (MHS) algorithm”. Finally, the simulation results are discussed and the superior performance of the suggested algorithm is verified through making a comprehensive comparison with some well-known methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Microgrid; Plug-in Electric Vehicle; Renewable Energy; Stochastic Scheduling; Vehicle-2-grid; Electromagnetic Wave Emission; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Fossil Fuels; Fuel Cells; Fuel Storage; Microgrids; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Scheduling; Solar Power Generation; Stochastic Programming; Stochastic Systems; Wind Power; Alternative Energy Source; Comprehensive Comparisons; Modified Harmony Search Algorithms; Modified Harmony Searches; Renewable Power Generation; Single Objective Optimization Problems; Solar Photovoltaic System; Stochastic Optimization Problems; Solar Cells","Electromagnetic wave emission; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Microgrids; Plug-in electric vehicles; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Alternative energy source; Comprehensive comparisons; Modified harmony search algorithms; Modified harmony searches; Renewable power generation; Single objective optimization problems; Solar photovoltaic system; Stochastic optimization problems; Solar cells","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University through the Fast-track Research Funding Program.; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61702075 ), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. 2018QNRC001 ).; Funding text 3: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61702075), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. 2018QNRC001).

A multinomial logit model is used to analyze individuals’ choice of travel mode from a dataset collected via a questionnaire-based household travel survey in 2016 and the geospatial data of BE variables; the dataset contains 762 responses from local residents in ten districts of the Hanoi Metropolitan Area about their daily travel episodes. It also examines a spatial aggregation effect by comparing model performances among four buffering distances and ward-zones. The results showed that (1) a higher population density around an individual’s home is associated with more bus use and less motorbike and car use; (2) mixed land use around the home, average tax revenue near the home, and bus frequency at the workplace have positive relationships with bus ridership; (3) senior people, students, or unskilled laborers tend to use the bus; (4) the spatial aggregation bias significantly affects the estimation results; and (5) new immigrants tend to choose to reside in areas designed for automobile users. Finally, there are several policy implications for transit-oriented development (TOD) in Hanoi, including: (1) parking regulations and/or control strategies should be jointly incorporated into the Hanoi’s TOD policy; (2) Hanoi’s TOD policy should be carefully designed in terms of its scope of development site and type; and (3) a polycentric structure strategy only may not be sufficient for increasing public transit ridership. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Built Environment; Hanoi; Transit-oriented Development; Travel Mode Choice; Buffering; Estimation Method; Household Survey; Immigrant; Metropolitan Area; Ownership; Population Density; Questionnaire Survey; Spatial Analysis; Strategic Approach; Travel Behavior; Workplace; Hanoi; Viet Nam","buffering; estimation method; household survey; immigrant; metropolitan area; ownership; population density; questionnaire survey; spatial analysis; strategic approach; travel behavior; workplace; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","","Sustainable Transport Studies in Asia Lecture Notes in Mobility, (2013); Sustainable Urban Transport in an Asian Context, (2010); Kato, Hironori, Development assistance to transportation in Asian developing countries, pp. 495-520, (2018); Transport Development in Asian Megacities, (2013); Zusman, Eric, Low Carbon Transport in Asia: Strategies for Optimizing Co-benefits, pp. 1-269, (2012); Transforming Cities with Transit Transit and Land Use Integration for Sustainable Urban Development, (2013); Cervero, Robert B., Linking urban transport and land use in developing countries, Journal of Transport and Land Use, 6, 1, pp. 7-24, (2013); Drilling, Matthias, Planning sustainable cities: Why environmental policy needs social policy, pp. 103-119, (2013); Trudeau, Dan, Sustaining suburbia through new urbanism: Toward growing, green, and just suburbs?, Urban Planning, 3, 4, pp. 50-60, (2018); White, Stacey Swearingen, Sustainability, the environment, and new urbanism: An assessment and agenda for research, Journal of Architectural and Planning Research, 24, 2, pp. 125-142, (2007)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095571677"

Five variables including name, age, sex, date of death, and cause of death were collected from 10,184 of 10,769 local state health centers. Mortality rates ratio and 95% confidence interval (MRR, 95%CI) were calculated to observe the risk of death from HIV/AIDS-related to socio-economic status and time trends. The age-adjusted HIV/AIDS mortality rate increased from 5.49 per 100,000 during 2005 to 6.03 during 2006 and 6.20 during 2007. An elevated risk of death was seen in high mountain districts in Nghe An province, adjusted MRR = 5.38, 95%, CI: 4.76–6.08 relative to the urban areas of Vinh and Cua Lo cities.

However, SAV distribution varies widely, in terms of depth and substrate types, making it difficult to monitor using in-situ measurement. Remote sensing can help address this issue. High spatial resolution satellites, with more bands and higher radiometric sensitivity, have been launched recently, including the Vietnamese Natural Resources, Environment, and Disaster Monitoring Satellite (VNREDSat-1) (V1) sensor from Vietnam, launched in 2013. The objective of the study described here was to establish SAV distribution maps for South-Central Vietnam, particularly in the Khanh Hoa coastal area, using Sentinel-2 (S2), Landsat-8, and V1 imagery, and then to assess any changes to SAV over the last ten years, using selected historical data. The satellite top-of-atmosphere signals were initially converted to radiance, and then corrected for atmospheric effects. This treated signal was then used to classify Khanh Hoa coastal water substrates, and these classifications were evaluated using 101 in-situ measurements, collected in 2017 and 2018. The results showed that the three satellites could provide high accuracy, with Kappa coefficients above 0.84, with V1 achieving over 0.87. Our results showed that, from 2008 to 2018, SAV acreage in Khanh Hoa was reduced by 74.2%, while gains in new areas compensated for less than half of these losses. This is the first study to show the potential for using V1 and S2 data to assess the distribution status of SAV in Vietnam, and its outcomes will contribute to the conservation of SAV beds, and to the sustainable exploitation of aquatic resources in the Khanh Hoa coastal area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distribution Map; Landsat-8; Sentinel-2; Submerged Aquatic Vegetation; Temporal Change Map; Vnredsat-1","","","","","Seagrasses Resource Status and Trends in Indonesia Japan Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam, (2011); Vietnamese Seagrasses and Seaweeds in Vietnamese, (2005); Seaweed Resources of the World, (1998); Seaweed Ecology and Physiology, (1997); Spalding, Mark D., The role of ecosystems in coastal protection: Adapting to climate change and coastal hazards, Ocean and Coastal Management, 90, pp. 50-57, (2014); Resources of Vietnamese Seagrass in Vietnamese, (2013); J Mar Sci Technol, (2015); Scientific Conference of Bien Dong 2002, (2002); Proceedings of the Fifth National Scientific Conference on Ecology and Biological Resources, (2013); Mar Res Collect, (2014)","","MDPI AG rasetti@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","22209964","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090724346"

Multivariable statistical analysis and weighted arithmetic water quality index (WAWQI) were used to analyze 40 water samples in each seasons. The results show that the mean concentrations of conductivity (EC), phosphate (PO<inf>4</inf>3-), ammonium (NH<inf>4</inf>+), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and potassium (K+) failed to meet theWorld Health Organization (WHO) and Vietnamese standards for both seasons. The NO<inf>2</inf>- concentration inside triple and double rice cropping systems during the dry season exceeds the permissible limit of the Vietnamese standard.

TheWAWQI showed that 97.5 and 95.0% of water samples fall into the bad and unsuitable, respectively, for drinking categories. The main reason behind this is direct discharge of untreated wastewater from the rice intensification and urban sewerage lines.

The aim of this study is to match the electricity demand with the intermittent solar-based renewable resources profile and to minimize the energy cost. The main contribution of the proposed model addresses uncertainties of the thermal load in smart buildings by considering detailed types of loads such as hot water, heating, and ventilation loads. In smart grids, buildings are no longer passive consumers. They are controllable loads, which can be used for demand-side energy management. Smart homes, as a domain of Internet of Things (IoT), enable energy systems of the buildings to operate as an active load in smart grids. The proposed formulation is cast as a stochastic MILP model for a 24-h horizon in order to minimize the total energy cost. In this study, Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to generate 1000 random scenarios for two environmental factors: the outdoor temperature, and solar radiation. Therefore in the proposed model, the thermal load, the output power of the photovoltaic panel, solar collector power generation, and electricity load become stochastic parameters. The proposed model results in an energy cost-saving of 20%, and a decrease of the peak electricity demand from 7.6 KWh to 4.2 KWh. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Storage; Smart Home; Solar Renewable; Stochastic Operation; Thermal Load; Alternative Energy; Building; Cost Analysis; Fuel Cell; Heating; Internet; Operations Technology; Photovoltaic System; Power Generation; Renewable Resource; Stochasticity; Thermal Power; Uncertainty Analysis; Ventilation","alternative energy; building; cost analysis; fuel cell; heating; Internet; operations technology; photovoltaic system; power generation; renewable resource; stochasticity; thermal power; uncertainty analysis; ventilation","","","","Tanaka, Kennichi, Optimal operation by controllable loads based on smart grid topology considering insolation forecasted error, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 2, 3, pp. 438-444, (2011); Noorollahi, Younes, Review of two decade geothermal energy development in Iran, benefits, challenges, and future policy, Geothermics, 77, pp. 257-266, (2019); Rahman, Kazi Akikur, Comparative study of stand-alone and hybrid solar energy systems suitable for off-grid rural electrification: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 27, pp. 738-752, (2013); Baljit, S.

This has increased awareness amongst Vietnamese farmers for conducting shrimp farming according to specific certification guidelines. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the situation of quality control and effectiveness of Good Aquaculture Practices (GAP) in Vietnam (VietGAP) for intensive shrimp systems by making a comparison between VietGAP and non-GAP applied farms. The farmers in the GAP system performed well on seven control points related to quality management, especially regarding reservoir construction, water monitoring, and chemical use. Of the farms, 49% reported disease, and the ratio of safety rejections was low. The farmers in non-GAP farms appeared to have weak practices in quality control with high usage of antibiotics, leading to 64% of farmers reporting disease and 20% of tested shipments being rejected. The VietGAP applied system has the potential to deal with disease and quality problems to increase export opportunity for Vannamei shrimp. However, VietGAP does not generate a high price premium in itself because it is not a recognized certificate in the global markets. The results reinforce previous findings regarding eco-certification and how it can be a useful tool to reduce small-scale producers' risk, even though it does not necessarily generate a price premium. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diseases; Eco-certification; Food Safety; Litopenaeus Vannamei; Quality Management; Vietgap; Whiteleg Shrimp; Agricultural Practice; Antibiotics; Crustacean; Food Safety; Quality Control; Reservoir; Small Scale Industry; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Decapoda (crustacea); Litopenaeus Vannamei","agricultural practice; antibiotics; crustacean; food safety; quality control; reservoir; small scale industry; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Decapoda (Crustacea); Litopenaeus vannamei","","","Funding text 1: Soc Trang is one of the largest commercial-shrimp-producing areas in the MD with its contribution of 134,184 MT over 54,098 ha in 2018.

As a result, the country has an extensive disaster risk database that consists of different hazard and risk maps to be used as reference in creating development plans. However, some communities are in relatively low risk zones, such as those in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan (with many inhabitants of the city believing it to be safe). This study seeks to ascertain how disaster risk is understood in coastal areas that are only slightly susceptible to natural hazards, in order to provide strategies to improve disaster risk governance. The study validated national data on coastal disaster risk through a topographical survey, questionnaire surveys, and group interviews (in March 2016 and 2017) to understand whether residents knew the risks they are exposed to. The research found that national data reflects local conditions but community members do not have a clear understanding of the risks, particularly coastal hazards. Moreover, the research found that there has been a recent disaster event, though it was not properly archived and transmitted to the next generation. Thus, there is a need to raise awareness to correctly explain and transmit knowledge about potential hazards even in communities that have relatively lower disaster risk. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Awareness; Coastal Communities; Palawan; Storm Surge; Tsunami","","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of the ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net) for their support of this research through the “Coastal disasters and climate change in Southeast Asia: An assessment and countermeasures for sustainable development of the fast-growing coastal areas” project.

Hence, this study aimed to describe the characteristics of nursing doctoral programs in East and South East Asian (ESEA) countries and regions from the views of doctoral program coordinators, and to explore the students' experiences of and satisfaction with their doctoral nursing program. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using two self-designed questionnaires, one focusing on PhD program coordinators and the other on doctoral students. Characteristics of the nursing doctoral programs focused on program characteristics, faculty characteristics, career pathways for graduates, and challenges for nursing doctoral education. Doctoral students' assessment of study experiences included quality of supervision, doctoral training programs, intellectual/cultural climate of institutions, general facilities/support, and the overall study experience and satisfaction. Results: In the PhD coordinators survey, 46 institutions across nine ESEA countries and regions participated. More than half of nursing departments had academic members from other health science disciplines to supervise doctoral nursing students. The majority of graduates were holding academic or research positions in higher education institutions. Faculty shortages, delays in the completion of the program and inadequate financial support were commonly reported challenges for doctoral nursing education. In the students' survey, 193 doctoral students participated. 88.3% of the students were satisfied with the supervision they received from their supervisors; however, 79% reported that their supervisors 'pushed' them to publish research papers. For doctoral training programs, 75.5% were satisfied with their curriculum; but around half reported that the teaching training components (55.9%) and mobility opportunities (54.2%) were not included in their programs. For overall satisfaction with the intellectual and cultural climate, the percentages were 76.1 and 68.1%, respectively. Only 66.7% of the students felt satisfied with the facilities provided by their universities and nursing institutions. Conclusion: Doctoral nursing programs in most of the ESEA countries value the importance of both research and coursework. Doctoral nursing students generally hold positive experiences of their study. However, incorporating more teaching training components, providing more opportunities for international mobility, and making more effort to improve research-related facilities may further enhance the student experience. There is also a need to have international guidelines and standards for quality indicators of doctoral programs to maintain quality and find solutions to global challenges in nursing doctoral education. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Doctoral Education; Nursing; Phd Degree; Student Experience; Article; Career; Climate; Curriculum; Doctoral Education; Financial Management; Human; Human Experiment; Major Clinical Study; Nursing Education; Nursing Student; Practice Guideline; Questionnaire; Satisfaction; Southeast Asia; Teaching; Cross-sectional Study; Female; Male; Asia, Southeastern; Cross-sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Nursing; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Female; Humans; Male; Nursing Education Research; Personal Satisfaction; Students, Nursing","article; career; climate; curriculum; doctoral education; financial management; human; human experiment; major clinical study; nursing education; nursing student; practice guideline; questionnaire; satisfaction; Southeast Asia; teaching; cross-sectional study; female; male; Asia, Southeastern; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Nursing; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Female; Humans; Male; Nursing Education Research; Personal Satisfaction; Students, Nursing","","","","Ketefian, Shaḱe, Issues and challenges in international doctoral education in nursing, Nursing and Health Sciences, 7, 3, pp. 150-156, (2005); Future of Nursing Focus on Education, (2010); Kim, Mi-ja, Quality of Nursing Doctoral Education and Scholarly Performance in U.S. Schools of Nursing: Strategic Areas for Improvement, Journal of Professional Nursing, 30, 1, pp. 10-18, (2014); Coetzee, Siedine Knobloch, The quality of doctoral nursing education in South Africa, Curationis, 38, 1, (2015); Kjellgren, Karin I., Evaluation of doctoral nursing programs - A review and a strategy for follow up, Nurse Education Today, 25, 4, pp. 316-325, (2005); Nagata, Satoko, Evaluation of doctoral nursing education in Japan by students, graduates, and faculty: A comparative study based on a cross-sectional questionnaire survey, Nurse Education Today, 32, 4, pp. 361-367, (2012); J Nurs Sci, (2013); Grebennikov, Leonid, Monitoring trends in research student experience, International Journal of Educational Management, 31, 2, pp. 118-130, (2017); Pearson, Margot, Research training and supervision development, Studies in Higher Education, 27, 2, pp. 135-150, (2002); Harman, Grant S., PhD student satisfaction with course experience and supervision in two Australian research-intensive universities, Prometheus: Critical Studies in Innovation, 21, 3, pp. 312-333, (2003)","","BioMed Central Ltd. info@biomedcentral.com","","","","","","14726920","","","32384895","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084721917"

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 82 HIV-infected MSM and 120 HIV-infected heterosexual men in Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. Demographical characteristics and clinical data were collected and analyzed using appropriate statistics (Mann–Whitney, Chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, and logistic regression). Results: The prevalence of OIs among MSM and heterosexual patients were 63.4% and 81.7%, respectively. The most frequent OI in the MSM group was human papilloma virus (HPV) (11%), followed by hepatitis B virus (8.5%), mycobacterium tuberculosis (7.3%), and Talaromycosis (2.4%). Conclusions: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that buying sex (odds ratio (OR) = 4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13–14.25) and injecting drugs (OR = 13.05, 95% CI: 2.39–71.21) were associated with increased odds of having OIs in heterosexual patients while increasing age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01–1.24) was correlated to increased odd of acquiring OIs in the MSM group. HIV-infected MSM accumulates OIs with increasing age, while heterosexual individuals increase opportunistic infections by buying sex or injecting drugs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hiv Infection; Msm; Opportunistic Infection; Vietnam; Anti-retroviral Agents; Antiretrovirus Agent; Adult; Complication; Cross-sectional Study; Hospital; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Male; Male Homosexuality; Medical Record; Opportunistic Infection; Prevalence; Statistical Model; Viet Nam; Adult; Anti-retroviral Agents; Cross-sectional Studies; Hiv Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Hospitals; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Medical Records; Opportunistic Infections; Prevalence; Vietnam","antiretrovirus agent; adult; complication; cross-sectional study; hospital; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; male homosexuality; medical record; opportunistic infection; prevalence; statistical model; Viet Nam; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Hospitals; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Medical Records; Opportunistic Infections; Prevalence; Vietnam","","Anti-Retroviral Agents","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was funded by the Training and Research Academic Collaboration (TRAC) – Sweden – Vietnam, under grant number: K9MATLAR, PI: Thanh Thi Dinh.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to express their appreciation to the TRAC project for financial support, with support from The Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation and support of research and higher education, STINT and the Karolinska Institute, KI, staffs at the Centre of Infectious disease, Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam, and the Laboratory Centre, Hanoi University of Public Health for valuable contributions.

The main contribution of this research is the comparative evaluation of on-grid decentralized or distributed renewable-powered desalination systems for sustainable water and energy supply planning. Applying a novel nexus approach, an interactive multi-period planning model is developed to highlight synergies and to identify conflicts of planning both energy and water sectors at the same time as endogenous subsystems of one overall system. For studying these synergies in this study, the pace of technology deployment and the path of decline in overall costs are assumed to be a function of experience and knowledge as two-factor learning curves. Using data from 81 projects, the levelized cost and capacity factor of utility-scale photovoltaic and wind supplies in the Middle East were calculated. The results indicate that a scenario with a decentralized water sector and renewable-powered multiple-effect distillation technology has the best overall performance among the proposed scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decentralized Desalination; Long-term Planning; Short-term Scheduling; Two-factor Learning Curve; Variable Renewable Energy; Water-energy-nexus; Alternative Energy; Decentralization; Desalination; Distillation; Economic Analysis; Energy Planning; Environmental Impact; Integrated Approach; Performance Assessment; Photovoltaic System; Research Work; Sustainability; Technical Efficiency; Water Storage; Water Supply; Middle East","alternative energy; decentralization; desalination; distillation; economic analysis; energy planning; environmental impact; integrated approach; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; research work; sustainability; technical efficiency; water storage; water supply; Middle East","","","For the water sector, according to the Iranian Sixth National Development Plan, the Ministry of Energy is assigned to propose a plan for transferring required knowledge and providing sufficient financial support toward supplying 70% of the urban water demand on the shoreline of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman by 2021 from desalination [61].

The former aims at predicting the number of buildings damaged by an earthquake, while the latter refers to whether each evacuation center (henceforth: shelter) has sufficient accommodation for evacuees through a simulated evacuation following an earthquake. The evacuee number, which is predicted by reference to damaged buildings and building population, is used as input data for estimating risk in relation to shelter capacity. That is, the output of risk estimation for residential building damage is an input for shelter capacity risk estimation. By making this integration, the proposed model can supply an integrated information flow for prediction, preparedness, and response in relation to potential earthquake disasters by offering, inter alia, predictions of seismic intensity, forecasts of building damage and evacuees, models of how residents move to evacuation shelters following earthquakes (evacuation simulations), and data on shelters with insufficient capacity (shelter capacity estimation). Moreover, this research also proposes a method for allocating residents to each building based on building floor area and the total population of each chome (or city district, a common administrative unit in Japan). The number of residents in each building depends on the building floor area and varies within each chome. This method of estimation differs from the average building population used in the literature, which assumes that the number of residents per building is constant throughout a chome. Furthermore, identifying the number of residents in each house or building makes it easier to predict the number of evacuees in each evacuation shelter through an evacuation simulation routing residents from their homes to the nearest shelters. The number of evacuees per shelter is then used to estimate risk in relation to shelter capacity by comparing it with the planned capacity of that shelter. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Population; Evacuation Simulation; Network Analysis; Seismic Intensity Simulation; Vulnerability Functions; Earthquakes; Electric Network Analysis; Floors; Forecasting; Geographic Information Systems; Housing; Network Security; Population Statistics; Building Population; Capacity Estimation; Earthquake Disaster; Evacuation Simulation; Integrated Informations; Preparedness , And Response; Residential Building; Seismic Intensity; Risk Perception; Building; Damage; Earthquake; Estimation Method; Gis; Hazard Management; Network Analysis; Numerical Model; Research Work; Residential Location; Risk Assessment; Seismicity; Simulation; Vulnerability; Japan","Earthquakes; Electric network analysis; Floors; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Housing; Network security; Population statistics; Building population; Capacity estimation; Earthquake disaster; Evacuation simulation; Integrated informations; Preparedness , and response; Residential building; Seismic intensity; Risk perception; building; damage; earthquake; estimation method; GIS; hazard management; network analysis; numerical model; research work; residential location; risk assessment; seismicity; simulation; vulnerability; Japan","","","","Anhorn, Johannes, Open space suitability analysis for emergency shelter after an earthquake, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 15, 4, pp. 789-803, (2015); Chou, Juisheng, Emergency shelter capacity estimation by earthquake damage analysis, Natural Hazards, 65, 3, pp. 2031-2061, (2013); Noto Peninsula Japan Earthquake of March 25 2007, (2007); Hashemi, Mahdi, A GIS-based earthquake damage assessment and settlement methodology, Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 31, 11, pp. 1607-1617, (2011); Public Portal for Seismic Hazard Information Across Japan, (2015); Accommodation Shelter Capacity, (2015); Disaster Assessment in Kanazawa City, (2015); 13th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering Vancouver, (2004); Proceedings of 12th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering Cd Rom, (2000); 22nd Earthquake Engineering Symp on Architecture Institute of Japan, (1994)","","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) onlinejls@asce.org 1801 Alexander Bell DriveGEO Reston VA 20191 Alabama","","","","","","15276988","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077215010"

This study aimed to explore the dynamics of responses to the restriction of nonylphenol (NP) and its ethoxylates (NPEOs) among the Vietnamese textile manufacturers from the perspectives of attitude and the perceptions of adaptabilities, risks, benefits, and barriers. The chemicals are used as surfactants and are known to be responsible for endocrine disrupting effects. In-depth interviews were conducted with technical specialists from four textile firms and one chemical supplier. Regulatory and market situations with regards to the chemicals were also assessed. The findings revealed varied responses to chemical elimination where perceived technical risk, financial risk, benefits, and barriers played different roles in driving a certain action. The attitude towards chemical restriction was shaped by the trade-off between perceptions of financial risk and benefits and was moderated by market strategy. Efforts, such as enhanced washing or reductions in the dose of NP/NPEOs, imply the potency of continuous discharge of these chemicals into the environment, suggesting critical investigations on NP/NPEOs removal to prioritize actions for balancing between economic growth and environmental protection. Poor access to new policies and technological and chemical innovations was the most important barrier among private firms, highlighting the roles of non-governmental textile and garment industrial/trade associations in enhancing their members’ informative capacity. The study reflects the significance of incorporation of firm behavior research into environmental risk management practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benefit Perception; Decision-making; Organizational Adaptation; Risk Perception; Technical Adaptation; Behavioral Research; Decision Making; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Endocrine Disrupters; Environmental Management; Health Risks; Risk Management; Surface Active Agents; Textile Industry; Textiles; Chemical Innovations; Chemical Suppliers; Environmental Risk Managements; In-depth Interviews; Market Strategies; Organizational Adaptation; Technical Adaptation; Technical Specialists; Risk Perception","Behavioral research; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental management; Health risks; Risk management; Surface active agents; Textile industry; Textiles; Chemical innovations; Chemical suppliers; Environmental risk managements; In-depth interviews; Market strategies; Organizational adaptation; technical adaptation; Technical specialists; Risk perception","","","This study was financially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (project no. 16H02356).

In this study, a novel hybrid soft computing model (RF-PSO) of random forest (RF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was developed and used to estimate the undrained shear strength of soil based on the clay content (%), moisture content (%), specific gravity (%), void ratio (%), liquid limit (%), and plastic limit (%). In this study, the experimental results of 127 soil samples from national highway project Hai Phong-Thai Binh of Vietnam were used to generate datasets for training and validating models. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) method was used to evaluate and compare performance of the proposed model with single RF model. The results show that the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) achieved a high accuracy performance (R = 0.89) in the prediction of shear strength of soil. Validation of the models also indicated that RF-PSO model (R = 0.89 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.453) is superior to the single RF model without optimization (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.48). Thus, the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) can be used for accurate estimation of shear strength which can be used for the suitable designing of civil engineering structures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning; Particle Swarm Optimization; Random Forest; Vietnam; Estimation Method; Foundation; Model Validation; Numerical Model; Optimization; Shear Strength; Soil Property; Hai Phong; Thai Binh; Viet Nam","estimation method; foundation; model validation; numerical model; optimization; shear strength; soil property; Hai Phong; Thai Binh; Viet Nam","","","","Poulos, Harry G., Design of reinforcing piles to increase slope stability, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 32, 5, pp. 808-818, (1995); Liu, Yaojun, Effects of vegetation on runoff generation, sediment yield and soil shear strength on road-side slopes under a simulation rainfall test in the three gorges reservoir area, China, Science of the Total Environment, 485-486, 1, pp. 93-102, (2014); Hettiarachchi, Hiroshan, Use of SPT blow counts to estimate shear strength properties of soils: Energy balance approach, Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering - ASCE, 135, 6, pp. 830-834, (2009); Motaghedi, Hossein, Analytical Approach for Determination of Soil Shear Strength Parameters from CPT and CPTu Data, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 39, 6, pp. 4363-4376, (2014); Cha, Minsu, Shear strength estimation of sandy soils using shear wave velocity, Geotechnical Testing Journal, 30, 6, pp. 484-495, (2007); Garven, E.

Methods: A nationally representative sample of persons aged 60 and older in Vietnam, taken from the 2011 Vietnam Aging Survey, was analyzed (N = 2,693, consisting of 1,622 women and 1,071 men). Ordinary least squares regression (OLS) was used to identify factors associated with functional disability in men and women, while Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for linear models was applied to examine how much of gender inequality in functional disability was attributed by the distribution of the social determinants. Results: The OLS results showed that functional disability score for women was significantly higher than that for men, and that men and women shared similarity in factors associated with functional disability (e.g., age, educational level, employment status, and perceived sufficiency of income). The decomposition results showed that the distribution of the social determinants explained about 54 per cent of gender inequality in functional disability; among the determinants, age, employment status, and educational level were the major drivers. Approximately 46 per cent of the inequality was explained by unobserved factors. Conclusion: The findings of this study highlight the need for policy to mitigate the social determinants (e.g., education and employment) that contribute to gender inequality in functional disability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Functional Disability; Health Inequality; Oaxaca-blinder; Older People; Social Determinants; Vietnam; Age Distribution; Aged; Article; Descriptive Research; Educational Status; Employment Status; Female; Functional Assessment; Functional Disease; Geriatric Assessment; Geriatric Patient; Health Care Policy; Health Care Survey; Human; Least Square Analysis; Major Clinical Study; Male; Priority Journal; Sex Difference; Social Determinants Of Health; Very Elderly; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Aging; Disabled Person; Employment; Health Disparity; Income; Middle Aged; Questionnaire; Sex Factor; Socioeconomics; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Aging; Disabled Persons; Employment; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Social Determinants Of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam","age distribution; aged; Article; descriptive research; educational status; employment status; female; functional assessment; functional disease; geriatric assessment; geriatric patient; health care policy; health care survey; human; least square analysis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sex difference; social determinants of health; very elderly; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; aging; disabled person; employment; health disparity; income; middle aged; questionnaire; sex factor; socioeconomics; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Disabled Persons; Employment; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","","","Arber, S., Subjective financial well-being, income and health inequalities in mid and later life in Britain, Social Science and Medicine, 100, pp. 12-20, (2014); Bang, Kyungsook, Health Status and the Demand for Healthcare among the Elderly in the Rural Quoc-Oai District of Hanoi in Vietnam, BioMed Research International, 2017, (2017); Journal of Human Resources, (1973); Case, Anne C., Sex differences in morbidity and mortality, Demography, 42, 2, pp. 189-214, (2005); Econometrica, (1960); de Andrade, Fabíola Bof, Relationship between oral health-related quality of life, oral health, socioeconomic, and general health factors in elderly Brazilians, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 60, 9, pp. 1755-1760, (2012); Health Econometrics Using Stata, (2017); Demirchyan, Anahit, Gender differences in predictors of self-rated health in Armenia: A population-based study of an economy in transition, International Journal for Equity in Health, 11, 1, (2012); Giang, Long Thanh, Working Beyond the Traditional Retirement Ages: How does Chronic Health Condition Influence Older Workers in Vietnam, Ageing International, 43, 2, pp. 158-173, (2018); Gove, Walter R., Gender differences in mental and physical illness: The effects of fixed roles and nurturant roles, Social Science and Medicine, 19, 2, pp. 77-84, (1984)","","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","01674943; 18726976","","AGGED","31778939","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075349592"

In recent decades, urban expansion has resulted in significant changes in transportation patterns including the demand for long-distance travel and the rise of car use. In addition, transit alternatives such as mass rapid transit and bus rapid transit have been introduced for improving service quality of public transport, connecting city centres and suburban areas, and tackling traffic congestion in many developing-country megacities. Therefore, the way motorcycles maintain important roles in facilitating the process of urbanisation has raised questions about future motorcycle use in new urban area. This study aims to explore behavioral intentions with regards to urban developments and new transit alternatives in motorcycle dependent cities. Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) is selected as a representative of developing-country megacities for this research. The study was designed using a psychological approach in order to identify corresponding factors influencing behavioral intentions. The results show that motorcycle continues to be the main mode, but less motorcycle use is also considered. Bus safety belief contributes more to the intention of public transport use in comparison with motorcycle safety awareness. Park-and-Ride scheme is likely to be a sustainable form for the combination of motorcycle and mass rapid transit in suburban areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Intentions; Developing Countries; Motorcycle","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology ( MEXT ) for the first author’s study at Toyo Univeristy and the survey support of Ho Chi Minh City Department of Transportation, Vietnam.","Iatss Research, (2007); undefined, (2013); Chang, Hsinlin, Exploring the vehicle dependence behind mode choice: Evidence of motorcycle dependence in Taipei, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 42, 2, pp. 307-320, (2008); Chen, Chingfu, The effects of rational and habitual factors on mode choice behaviors in a motorcycle-dependent region: Evidence from Taiwan, Transport Policy, 18, 5, pp. 711-718, (2011); Iatss Research, (2006); undefined, (2014); Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, (2013); Transport Development in Asian Megacities A New Perspective, (2013); Gwilliam, Kenneth M., Urban transport in developing countries, Transport Reviews, 23, 2, pp. 197-216, (2003); undefined, (2012)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","2213624X; 22136258","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054094537"

For instance, retractions help scientific enterprise perform its self-correcting function and provide lessons for future researchers; furthermore, they represent the fulfillment of social responsibilities, and they enable scientific communities to offer better monitoring services to keep problematic studies in check. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the practice of retraction in scientific publishing from the first incident to the present. Methods: We built a database using SQL Server 2016 and homemade artificial intelligence tools to extract and classify data sources including RetractionWatch, official publishers' archives, and online communities into ready-to-analyze groups and to scan them for new data. After data cleaning, a dataset of 18,603 retractions from 1,753 (when the first retracted paper was published) to February 2019, covering 127 research fields, was established. Results: Notable retraction events include the rise in retracted articles starting in 1999 and the unusual number of retractions in 2010. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Elsevier, and Springer account for nearly 60% of all retracted papers globally, with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers contributing the most retractions, even though it is not the organization that publishes the most journals. Finally, reasons for retraction are diverse but the most common is ""fake peer review"". Conclusion: This study suggests that the frequency of retraction has boomed in the past 20 years, and it underscores the importance of understanding and learning from the practice of retracting scientific articles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Academic Publishing; Retraction; Scientific Publication; Self-correcting Capability","","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under the National Research Grant no. 502.01-2018.19.

Based on articles retrieved from the Web of Science database during the period 1992-2018, we found that the number of scientific publications, international collaborations, and allocated funds regarding depressive disorder among university students in China (97 articles, 43 international collaborations, and 52 funds provided, respectively) overwhelmingly surpassed the case of Korea (37 articles, 12 international collaborations, and 15 funds provided, respectively) and Japan (24 articles, 5 international collaborations, and 6 funds provided, respectively). The differences in collaboration patterns (p-value < 0.05) and the proportion of allocated funds (p-value < 0.05) among Korea, Japan, and China were also noted using Fisher's exact test. Based on the Poisson regression analysis, China's associations of scientific impact with international collaboration (β =-0.322, p-value < 0.01) and funding provision (β =-0.397, p-value < 0.01) are negative, while associations of the scientific impact and scientific quality with funding provision and international collaboration were statistically insignificant. These findings hint that Korea and Japan lacked scientific output, diversity in research targets, international collaboration, and funding provision, compared to China, but the quality of either China's internationally collaborated or funded articles was contentious. As a result, policymakers in Korea and Japan are suggested to raise the importance of mental health problems in their future policy planning and resource distribution.

Using or not using these data sources have been questioned for data integration or model estimation and validation. Therefore, as an initial step, the data quality of new data sources was evaluated to identify the potential for data integration with NPTS or new data collection methods to replace NPTS. This study focused on finding out the similarities in travel patterns extracted from these data sources using a nonnegative matrix factorization method. This study found that origin–destination pairs in the MOBI travel patterns were significantly different from those of NPTS and WEB, while there were some similarities between NPTS and WEB.

In Vietnam, event-based surveillance (EBS), critical for the early detection of emerging disease outbreaks and acute public health events, has been limited to media-based EBS until recently. In 2017–2018, the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, designed, implemented, and evaluated a hospital EBS demonstration pilot in six hospitals in two provinces in Vietnam. After the 9-month implementation period, we conducted a logbook review, eight interviews, and six focus group discussions with hospital and preventive medicine staff, and conducted thematic and descriptive analysis. During the implementation period, 11 signals were reported and confirmed as true events. Of the 11 signals, majority (N = 8, 72.7%) were detected in ICU, followed by the outpatient department (N = 2, 18.2%). The most common signal were clusters of food poisoning (N = 4, 36.4%). All (100%) signals were reported, risk-assessed, and responded to within 24 hours of signal detection. The hospital and preventive medicine staff reported that one of the main benefits of the pilot was their improved mutual relationship. This pilot formalised hospital event-based surveillance through a legal framework, standard operating procedures, a formal feedback mechanism to hospitals to facilitate a two-way conversation, and providing additional training and continued sensitisation. Most importantly, it fostered a trusting relationship between the curative medicine and public health sectors, marking an important step towards advancing the national event-based surveillance system in Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disease Outbreak; Event-based Surveillance; Global Health Security; Hospital Reporting; International Health Regulations","","","","","Ebs Mid Term Progress Check Report Ebs Pilot Vietnam Internal Report, (2017); Clará, Alexey Wilfrido, Factors Influencing Community Event-based Surveillance: Lessons Learned from Pilot Implementation in Vietnam, Health Security, 16, pp. S66-S75, (2018); Clará, Alexey Wilfrido, Event-based surveillance at community and healthcare facilities, Vietnam, 2016–2017, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 24, 9, pp. 1649-1658, (2018); Dagina, Rosheila, Event-based surveillance in Papua New Guinea: strengthening an International Health Regulations (2005) core capacity, Western Pacific Surveillance and Response Journal : WPSAR, 4, 3, pp. 19-25, (2013); Figueiras-Guzman, Adolfo G., Influence of physicians' attitudes on under-notifying infectious diseases: A longitudinal study, Public Health, 118, 7, pp. 521-526, (2004); Friedman, Steven Marc, Suboptimal reporting of notifiable diseases in Canadian emergency departments: a survey of emergency physician knowledge, practices, and perceived barriers., Canada Communicable Disease Report, 32, 17, pp. 187-198, (2006); Ebs Dissemination Workshopmeeting Notes 26 27 June 2017 Internal Document, (2017); Epidemiol Health, (2015); Konowitz, Paul M., The underreporting of disease and physicians' knowledge of reporting requirements, Public Health Reports, 99, 1, pp. 31-35, (1984); Krause, Gérard, Notifiable disease surveillance and practicing physicians, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 11, 3, pp. 442-445, (2005)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","23779497","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148556286"

Ancestor worship is regarded as the most significant social institution in East Asian societies sharing Confucian tradition, such as Japan and Vietnam. Ancestor worship is a kind of reciprocal system in which the living and the deceased exchange mutual care. It links one’s self to the ever-continuing family lineage, providing a basis for an individual’s identity. In contemporary Japan, such beliefs and customs are rapidly diminishing due to drastic changes in population and family structure since the Second World War. This chapter addresses the question that how people in Japan cope with the situation in which the traditional assurance for their afterlife does not work well, and identifies the ways in which they seek alternative bases for their identity by examining the case of a new trend in burial. The new trend in death preparation indicates a silent transition from “bonds with the deceased” to “bonds with the living” in contemporary Japanese society. Both types of bonds can assure one’s sense of self and the meaning of life and fit the contextual features of East Asian societies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ancestor Worship; Bonds With The Deceased; Bonds With The Living; Shrinking Family; The Self","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements This work was supported by the MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities of Japan, 2014\u20132018 (S1491003) and by a research grant from the Senshu University Research Fellowship 2017.

However, the coconut jelly production has resulted in significant environmental impacts, particularly to the aquatic environment due to its heavily polluted wastewater e.g. very high values of COD (up to 120,000 mg/1), of total nitrogen (up to 1,740 mg/1), and of total phosphorus (up to 64 mg/1). The available wastewater treatment technology for such type of wastewater is likely to be not economically efficient due to the small-scale production at craft villages in the developing countries. This study developed and demonstrated an integrated eco-model for small (family) scale production of raw coconut jelly in craft villages which applied Cleaner Production sollutions for pollution prevention on the basis of available conditions at the local family. The system demonstration showed a win-win solution for family with major benefits by reduction of 90% of pollutants (i.e 27 kg COD, 21.4 kg BOD5, approx. 7 kg N, 113 g P and 28 kg SO<inf>4</inf>2- for one production batch), as well as the other benefit by major reduction of 90 % of investment and operating costs of the wastewater treatment plant. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial Cellulose; Cleaner Production; Ecosystem; Integrated Pollution Reduction; Nata De Coco","","","","This research was funded by the Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under the grant number KHCN-TNB/14-19/C25.

The parents usually stop and park their vehicle on streets outside the school gates, which can lead to serious congestion and increases the likelihood of traffic accidents. Methods: The objective of this study is to find out factors affecting the picking up of pupils at primary school by evaluating the typical primary schools in Hanoi city. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors that influence the decision of picking up pupils and the waiting duration of parents. The behavior of motorcyclists during the process of picking up pupils at the primary school gate has been identified and analyzed in detail by the Kinovea software. Results and Discussion: The study showed that, on the way back home, almost all parents use motorbikes (89.15%) to pick up their children. During their waiting time (8.48 minutes in average), they made a lot of illegal parking actions on the street there by, causing a lot of “cognitive” errors and “crash” points surrounding in front of the primary school entrance gate. Risky picking-up behaviors were significantly observed, i.e. picking-up on opposite side of the school, making a U-turn, backing-up dangerously, parking on the middle of street, and parking on the street next to sidewalk). Conclusion: Based on the analyzed results, several traffic management measures have been suggested to enhance traffic safety and reduce traffic congestion in front of school gates. In addition, the results of the study will provide a useful reference for policymakers and authorities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hanoi; Motorcycles; Picking Up Behaviour; Primary School; Traffic Congestion; Traffic Safety","","","","Funding text 1: This study has been funded by the Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam under grant no.

We find that the Vietnamese non-farm sector has a positive effect on both farm value-added and efficiency. This result indicates that income from non-farm activities relaxes liquidity constraints and farmers can reinvest this capital in agricultural production.

Specifically, a meta-analytic investigation of 5,687 participants was conducted to examine the relationship between EI and emotional manipulation. The findings revealed that self-reported ability-based EI was positively correlated to non-prosocial emotional manipulation (as measured by the Emotional Manipulation Scale), with a 0.10 effect size. Whereas, a negative relationship emerged between self-reported trait EI and non-prosocial emotional manipulation (as measured by the Worsen factor of the Managing Emotions of Others Scale [MEOS]), with a −0.16 effect size. Moreover, self-reported trait-based EI was positively correlated with prosocial emotional manipulation (as measured by the Enhance and Divert factors of the MEOS), with effect sizes of 0.40 and 0.34, respectively. Furthermore, gender had a moderating effect on the relationship between self-reported ability-based EI and non-prosocial emotional manipulation; this relationship was stronger among males than females.

The contracts were described by four attributes, including premium for certified organic shrimp, premium-payment delay, selling place and the provision of quality seed. Conditional logit and mixed logit models were used to analyze the data which were collected among shrimp farmers in Vietnam. The results indicate that farmers prefer the contract with a higher premium; however, premium-payment delay decreases farmers’ utility and the probability of choosing the contract. Besides the premium, the provision of quality seed is an important attribute that attracts farmers to choose a contract. Almost farmers prefer to sell their shrimp from farms. The results also show heterogeneity in farmers’ preferences for the contract’s attributes and their willingness to accept these attributes. These findings should be carefully considered in building reasonable and attractive contracts for shrimp farmers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Certified Organic Shrimp; Choice Experiments; Contract Design; Farmers’ Stated Preference; Heterogeneous Preferences","","","","Funding text 1: to preserve the mangroves and promote responsible aquaculture production through the certification of organic shrimp (GIZ, 2014).

Good business management requires us to consider the impacts of multi macro factors on stock price, and it contributes to promoting business plan and economic policies for economic growth and stabilizing macroeconomic factors. By data collection method through statistics, analysis, synthesis, comparison, quantitative analysis to generate qualitative comments and discussion; using econometric method to perform regression equation and evaluate quantitative results, the article analyzed and evaluated the impacts of seven (7) macroeconomic factors on stock price of a joint stock commercial bank, Sacombank (STB) in Vietnam in the period of 201 4-2019, both positive and negative sides. The results of quantitative research, in a seven factor model, show that the increase in GDP growth, reduction in CPI and lending rate has a significant effect on increasing STB stock price with the highest impact coefficient, the second is decreasing the risk free rate.

The selected laser scanner is small and lightweight (approximate 0.37 kg) with a rectangular footprint. Field observations were conducted in 2016 with a line scanner installed above the rice canopy. Based on results of our investigation, the laser pulse of the HOKUYO UTM 30LX finds it more difficult to reach the ground surface because of the 4-cm long rectangular footprint. Although the laser scanner is small and lightweight, and the selected target areas in this study were larger than in the previous study, relatively accurate results were still obtained. More specifically, the top of the rice plant was found to correspond to pt = 1, and the bottom of the rice plant was chosen at four percentile ranks (pb = 70, pb = 80, pb = 95, and pb = 99). The relative vertical distance (rD) was identified as the distance between the bottom and top of the rice plant. According to the results, rD strongly correlated with H with r2 ≥ 0.86 in all cases, and the root mean squared error was 1.0 cm. The slope of the regression line was only close to 1.0 (r2 ≥ 0.96) for pb = 99. The plant height exceeded the relative vertical distance by 22.0 cm. The accuracy of the results largely depends on the laser footprint size of the specific laser scanner used, and larger laser footprints correspond to larger bias between rD and H. Results of this study, which confirmed the viability and feasibility of our proposed method for estimating rice plant height using the HOKUYO UTM 30 LX, are presented and discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Detection Method; Estimation Method; Feasibility Study; Height Determination; Laser Method; Regression Analysis; Rice","detection method; estimation method; feasibility study; height determination; laser method; regression analysis; rice","","","This research is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Nos. 23580361, 26450362 and Ho chi Minh City University of Technology-VNU-HCM under grant number T-KTXD-2018-46.

It also provides us with a model to identify key causes of these above risk fluctuations. Firstly, by using quantitative and analytical methods to estimate asset and equity beta of the total 205 listed companies in Vietnam’s real estate, construction and construction material industry with a proper traditional model, we found that in the viewpoint of asset beta used as market risk measurement, the construction industry has the lowest risk, next is the construction material industry and real estate one has the highest risk. Secondly, we recognized that in the real estate, construction and construction material industry, the main factors affecting market risk are GDP growth, lending rate, and inflation. Thirdly, by using a proper quantitative analysis method, the study realized that in the viewpoint of asset beta, construction industry has the lowest market risk because of GDP growth decreasing, inflation increasing and average income increasing. On the contrary, real estate industry has the highest market risk because GDP growth decreases and lending rate increases. Finally, this paper provides some outcomes that could provide companies and government with more evidence in establishing their policies in governance and in monitoring these industries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rate; Key-words:-construction Industry; Lending Rate; Market Risk; Policy; Real Estate","","","","","Leverage Effect Volatility Feedback and Self Exciting Market Disruptions Ssrn Working Paper, (2007); Chen, K.

In particular, tax structure is measured through the annual growth rate of tax revenue of 63 provinces and cities of Vietnam in terms of three groups: consumption tax (CT), income tax (IT), and property tax (PT) during the period of 11 years from 2007 to 2017. The research data was collected from the General Department of Taxation of Vietnam. Economic growth is a dependent variable, represented by the annual growth rate of the gross domestic product of each locality with the data source from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam. With the regression analysis according to the GMM method, the research results showed that consumption tax (CT) and income tax (IT) had a positive impact on economic growth in the localities of Vietnam, and property tax (PT) was not statistically significant. In addition, the study has achieved great success by identifying the consumption tax components that had significantly positive impacts on economic growth (GDP), namely export and import taxes (CT1), value added tax (CT2); meanwhile, excise tax (CT3) had a negative effect on economic growth (GDP). For income tax, personal income tax (IT2) also had a positive effect on economic growth (GDP). The research results are the first empirical evidence in Vietnam of the impact of the tax structure on economic growth in the localities, which is important for the Government of Vietnam to have a basis for managing tax policies in order to stimulate economic growth in a sustainable manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumption Tax; Economic Growth; Income Tax; Property Tax; Structure","","","","","Tax Policy and Labor Market Performance, (2006); Edicion Especial, (2019); Arnold, Jens Matthias, Tax Policy for Economic Recovery and Growth, Economic Journal, 121, 550, pp. F59-F80, (2011); Journal of Accounting and Taxation, (2017); Bania, Neil, Growth, taxes, and government expenditures: Growth hills for U.S. States, National Tax Journal, 60, 2, pp. 193-204, (2007); Journal of Political Economy, (1990); Barro, Robert T., Economic growth in a cross section of countries, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106, 2, pp. 407-443, (1991); Blundell, Richard W., Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models, Journal of Econometrics, 87, 1, pp. 115-143, (1998); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2013); Taxation of Income and Economic Growth an Empirical Analysis of 25 Rich OECD Countries, (2012)","","Primrose Hall Publishing Group","","","","","","22011323; 22011315","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083572590"

In addition, the study has examined the mediating role of employee satisfaction in the relationship between career management policy and job performance, between career development and job performance, and between career information and job performance. Lastly, the moderating role of job security in the relationship between employee satisfaction and job performance was examined. The study offers a perspective that explains the relation between job satisfaction and the level of happiness of employees. Employee happiness levels are also measured by job satisfaction, which fulfils the employee's needs and desires at the workplace. Happiness levels correlate with employee efforts to attain their needs and desires. The intangible variable can be observed and expressed through the emotional feelings; job satisfaction is one of the intangible variables. If the job meets acceptable physiological as well as psychological needs, the level of job satisfaction increases. The current study has filled this gap. However, this study is among the pioneering studies on this issue. Employing the survey-based methodology; the SEM-PLS technique was used to test the hypothesised relationships. So, the current study has used SEM-PLS as a statistical tool to answer the research questions raised in this study and research objectives envisaged in the current study. Private school teachers in Indonesia were given surveys to collect the data of the study. The findings of the study have provided support for the theoretical foundation and the proposed hypothesis of the current study. The current study will be helpful for policymakers and practitioners in understanding the issues related to career management policy, career development, career information, employee satisfaction, job security and job performance.

Among approaches, mutation is a direct alteration on the genome and considered as one of the most beneficial routes to acquire new beneficial traits in rice. An experiment was carried out to explore the effects of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) mutation on the antioxidant activities, phytochemical compounds, and momilactones A (MA) and B (MB) in rice. Two rice cultivars, K1 (an original cultivar DT84) and K2 (mutated DT84), were examined. Antioxidant activities, phenolic compounds, and momilactones of the rice grain, husk, and straw portions were measured and quantified. Antioxidant activities were higher in grain and straw of K2, whereas K1 showed greater antioxidant activity in rice husk. Additionally, K2 displayed higher total phenolic contents (TPC) in grain and straw as well as lower of it in the husk, but these variations significantly differed only in the straw portion. An increase in total flavonoid contents (TFC) was observed in the husk of K1, while K2 significantly enhanced TFC in straw. Both MA and MB, two compounds obtaining antidiabetes, anticancer, antimicrobial, antigout, and antiobesity properties, were detected and quantified in grain, husk, and straw of K1 and K2 samples. Generally, the contents of MA were higher than MB in all tested portions of rice crop. MA and MB were higher in straw followed by those in husk and grain, respectively. K2 contained higher amounts of MA and MB in straw and husk, but lower contents in grain compared with those in K1. This study illustrates that MNU mutation can improve grain quality and enhance bioactive compounds in straw, husk, and grain of rice. This approach has the potential to develop functional foods from rice, and therefore help farmers in developing countries to improve value in rice production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anticancer; Antidiabetes; Antigout; Antiobesity; Antioxidants; Flavonoids; Mnu Mutation; Momilactone A; Momilactone B; Phenolics; Rice; Crop Improvement; Experimental Study; Mutation; Phenolic Compound; Physicochemical Property; Phytochemistry; Plant Extract; Rice; Secondary Metabolite; Urea","crop improvement; experimental study; mutation; phenolic compound; physicochemical property; phytochemistry; plant extract; rice; secondary metabolite; urea","","","This research did not receive any external funding.

The City of Kitakyushu, Japan has actively implemented eco-friendly policies since 1967 and recently inspired the pursuit of sustainable development around the world, especially in the Global South region. However, empirical studies on the effects of green growth policies are still lacking. This study explores the relationship between road infrastructure development and average industrial firm size with air pollution in the city through the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Non-linear Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) methods were applied on nearly 50-years’ time series data, from 1967 to 2015. The results show that the shape of the EKC of industrial growth, measured by average firm size, depends on the type of air pollution: inverted N-shaped relationships with NO<inf>2</inf> and CO, and the U-shaped relationships with falling dust particle and O<inf>x</inf>. Regarding infrastructure development, on the one hand, our analysis shows a positive effect of road construction on alleviating the amount of falling dust and CO concentration. On the other hand, the emissions of NO<inf>2</inf> and O<inf>x</inf> are shown to rise when plotted against road construction. The decline of CO emission, when plotted against both industrial growth and road development, indicates that the ruthlessness of the local government in pursuing green growth policies has been effective in this case. However, the story is not straightforward when it comes to other air pollutants, which hints at the limits of the current policies. The case of Kitakyushu illustrates the complex dynamics of the interaction among policy, industry, infrastructure, and air pollution. It can serve as an important reference point for other cities in the Global South when policies are formed, and progress is measured in the pursuit of a green economy. Finally, as an OECD SDGs pilot city and the leading Asian green-growth city, policymakers in Kitakyushu city are recommended to revise the data policy to enhance the findability and interoperability of data, as well as to invest in the application of big data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abokyi, Eric, Industrial growth and emissions of CO2 in Ghana: The role of financial development and fossil fuel consumption, Energy Reports, 5, pp. 1339-1353, (2019); Ahmad, Najid, Modelling the CO2 emissions and economic growth in Croatia: Is there any environmental Kuznets curve?, Energy, 123, pp. 164-172, (2017); Akbostancı, Elif, The relationship between income and environment in Turkey: Is there an environmental Kuznets curve?, Energy Policy, 37, 3, pp. 861-867, (2009); Ali, Wajahat, Re-visiting the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for Malaysia: Fresh evidence from ARDL bounds testing approach, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 77, pp. 990-1000, (2017); Andreoni, James, The simple analytics of the environmental Kuznets curve, Journal of Public Economics, 80, 2, pp. 269-286, (2001); Anenberg, Susan Casper, Estimates of the global burden of ambient PM2:5, ozone, and NO2 on asthma incidence and emergency room visits, Environmental Health Perspectives, 126, 10, (2018); Banerjee, Anindya, Error-correction mechanism tests for cointegration in a single-equation framework, Journal of Time Series Analysis, 19, 3, pp. 267-283, (1998); Barnes, Paul W., Ozone depletion, ultraviolet radiation, climate change and prospects for a sustainable future, Nature Sustainability, 2, 7, pp. 569-579, (2019); Saqib, Abdul, The renewable energy, growth and environmental Kuznets curve in Turkey: An ARDL approach, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 52, pp. 587-595, (2015); Society 5 0, (2020)","","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

Thus, this study considered a case of shrimp farmers in Vietnam to identify whether the farmers’ networks have positive effects on diffusing accurate agricultural information to the treated farmers and their neighbors. To explore the effects, we invited farmers selected using network-based targeting to a workshop held in December 2017 and estimated it using data obtained before and after the treatment. We found that: 1) the targeting has a positive effect on the treated farmers’ knowledge level about a good aquaculture practice; 2) The treated farmers selected using the network-based targeting share information with more neighbors when they get new information; and 3) The targeting has a positive spillover effect on untreated farmers' knowledge level, but its effect is lower than other randomly selected. These findings can conclude that network-based targeting appears to be a method to disseminate information to many people. Nevertheless, the methods are less likely to deliver accurate information to a wider group of farmers than random sampling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Better Management Practices; Betweenness Centrality; Network-based Targeting; Shrimp Farming; Simple Random Sampling; Systematic Unaligned Random Sampling; Best Management Practice; Farmers Knowledge; Sampling; Shrimp Culture; Social Network; Spillover Effect; Technology Adoption; Technology Transfer; Viet Nam; Decapoda (crustacea)","best management practice; farmers knowledge; sampling; shrimp culture; social network; spillover effect; technology adoption; technology transfer; Viet Nam; Decapoda (Crustacea)","","","Financial supports from the JSPS Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Research Fellow Grant Numbers JP17J08994, Grant Numbers JP15H05179 and JP25101003, and the Institute of Developing Economies-Japan External Trade Organization are acknowledged.

In this study, antioxidant and anti-skin-aging activities of MA and MB were investigated and compared with tricin, a well-known antioxidant and antiaging flavonoid in rice. MA, MB, and tricin were purified from rice husk by column chromatography and their biological activities were subsequently assayed by in vitro trials. The contents of MA, MB, and tricin of different commercial rice cultivars in Japan were quantified and confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. The antioxidant assays revealed a synergistic activity of the mixture MA and MB (MAB, 1:1, v/v). In addition, in 2,2'-azino-bis (ABTS) assay, IC50 values of MAB (0.3 mg/mL) and tricin (0.3 mg/mL) was 4-fold and 9-fold greater than that of individual MB (1.3 mg/mL) or MA (2.8 mg/mL), respectively. The in vitro enzymatic assays on pancreatic elastase and tyrosinase indicated that MA and MB were potential to relief skin wrinkles and freckles. In detail, MA exerted higher inhibition on both enzymatic activities (30.9 and 37.6% for elastase and tyrosinase inhibition, respectively) than MB (18.5 and 12.6%) and MAB (32.0 and 19.7%) at a concentration of 2.0 mg/mL. Notably, MA and the mixture MAB exhibited stronger inhibitions on elastase and tyrosinase in comparison with tricin and vanillin.

The linear regression model was chosen and validated for forest biomass estimation in A Luoi district, Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. A Landsat 8 OLI image and a dual-polarized ALOS/PALSAR-2 L-band (HH, HV polarizations) were used. In addition, 11 diferrent vegetation indices were extracted to test the performance of Landsat data in estimating forest AGB Total of 54 plots were collected in the bamboo and mixed bamboo forest in 2016. The linear regression is used to evaluate the sensitivity of biomass to the obtained parameters, including radar polarization, optical properties, and some vegetation indices which are extracted from Landsat data. The best-fit linear regression is selected by using the Bayesian Model Average for biomass estimation. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was employed to test the robustness of the model through the coefficient of determination (R squared - R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results show that Landsat 8 OLI data has a slightly better potential for biomass estimation than PALSAR-2 in the bamboo and mixed bamboo forest. Besides, the combination of PALSAR-2 and Landsat 8 OLI data also has a no significant improvement (R2 of 0.60) over the performance of models using only SAR (R2 of 0.49) and only Landsat data (R2 of 0.58-0.59). The univariate model was selected to estimate AGB in the bamboo and mixed bamboo forest. The model showed good accuracy with an R2 of 0.59 and an RMSE of 29.66 tons&thinsp;ha&minus;1. The comparison between two approaches using the entire dataset and LOOCV demonstrates no significant difference in R (0.59 and 0.56) and RMSE (29.66 and 30.06 tons&thinsp;ha&minus;1). This study performs the utilization of remote sensing data for biomass estimation in bamboo and mixed bamboo forest, which is a lack of up-to-date information in forest inventory. This study highlights the utilization of the linear regression model for estimating AGB of the bamboo forest with a limited number of field survey samples. However, future research should include a comparison with non-linear and non-parametric models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aboveground Biomass; Bamboo; Mixed Bamboo Forest; Multivariate Linear Regression; Remote Sensing Data; Thua Thien Hue Province; Vietnam; Bayesian Networks; Biomass; Data Mining; Forestry; Linear Regression; Mean Square Error; Optical Properties; Polarization; Remote Sensing; Space-based Radar; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Vegetation; Above Ground Biomass; Bamboo Forests; Multivariate Linear Regressions; Remote Sensing Data; Thua Thien Hue Province; Viet Nam; Bamboo","Bayesian networks; Biomass; Data mining; Forestry; Linear regression; Mean square error; Optical properties; Polarization; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Above ground biomass; Bamboo forests; Multivariate linear regressions; Remote sensing data; Thua Thien Hue province; Viet Nam; Bamboo","","","","undefined; Antropov, Oleg S., Polarimetric ALOS PALSAR time series in mapping biomass of boreal forests, Remote Sensing, 9, 10, (2017); Avitabile, Valerio, Capabilities and limitations of Landsat and land cover data for aboveground woody biomass estimation of Uganda, Remote Sensing of Environment, 117, pp. 366-380, (2012); Badreldin, Nasem, Estimating forest biomass dynamics by integrating multi-temporal Landsat satellite images with ground and airborne LiDAR data in the Coal Valley Mine, Alberta, Canada, Remote Sensing, 7, 3, pp. 2832-2849, (2015); Baret, Frédéric, Potentials and limits of vegetation indices for LAI and APAR assessment, Remote Sensing of Environment, 35, 2-3, pp. 161-173, (1991); Basuki, Tyas Mutiara, Estimating tropical forest biomass more accurately by integrating ALOS PALSAR and Landsat-7 ETM+ data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 34, 13, pp. 4871-4888, (2013); Carreiras, Joāo M.B., Understanding the relationship between aboveground biomass and ALOS PALSAR data in the forests of Guinea-Bissau (West Africa), Remote Sensing of Environment, 121, pp. 426-442, (2012); A Layman S Interpretation Guide to L Band and C Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Data, (2018); Chowdhury, Tanvir Ahmed, Polarimetric parameters for growing stock volume estimation using ALOS PALSAR L-Band data over siberian forests, Remote Sensing, 5, 11, pp. 5725-5756, (2013); Chrysafis, Irene, Estimating Mediterranean forest parameters using multi seasonal Landsat 8 OLI imagery and an ensemble learning method, Remote Sensing of Environment, 199, pp. 154-166, (2017)","Zhou, X.; Wu, H.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","2019 ISPRS and GEO Workshop on Geospatially-enabled SDGs Monitoring for the 2030 Agenda","","Changsha","158142","16821750","9781629935126; 9781629934297; 9781629935201","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081575759"

This paper explores the perceptions of local enterprises in Yakushima, Japan, concerning tourism’s contribution to the local economy, its effects on income distribution, and its impacts on spatial differences among villages. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 local tourism stakeholders. We found that although all respondents perceive tourism as contributing positively to Yakushima’s economy, they have different perspectives on income distribution among tourism participants. They also raised questions about the flow of money from tourism. The findings reveal that tourism may not necessarily contribute to equal income distribution and is perceived as creating unequal benefits. Also, it creates a gap between tourist villages and non-tourist villages. Our research suggests that tourism policies aimed at equal income distribution and balanced spatial development should consider the perspectives of all tourism stakeholders. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Income Distribution; Japan; Local Enterprises; Perspectives; Tourism Contribution; Yakushima","","","","This research was supported by Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03274], and the author (V.

In the traditional method where manual labour and experiences play important roles, early plant disease detection and prevention for field crop are inefficient. This can bring negative effects in stopping the spread of diseases. Applications of image processing techniques and computer vision may provide a solution to these problems. Deep learning is known as one of the most powerful techniques which is able to address more complicated tasks compared to traditional machine learning thanks to the embedded complex layers. This paper presents an image-based diseases identification method using a deep neural network with contrast enhancement and transfer learning from the PlantVillage dataset. Since there exist various sizes of leaf, rescaling and centre alignment are performed to standardize images. Besides, contrast enhancement is used to improve quality of visualization which gives a well-prepared step for further processing. By using a collected mango disease dataset, the proposed model is trained to identify 3 common diseases from the healthy one. The proposed model is then compared with other pre-trained models. An accuracy of 88.46% is achieved for the proposed model, which is higher than the results obtained from other pre-trained models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrast Enhancement; Deep Learning; Disease Identification; Mango Leaf Disease; Residual Neural Network; Agricultural Robots; Crops; Deep Neural Networks; Fruits; Image Enhancement; Learning Systems; Transfer Learning; Common Disease; Contrast Enhancement; Field Crops; Identification Method; Image Processing Technique; Image-based; Plant Disease; Spread Of Disease; Deep Learning","Agricultural robots; Crops; Deep neural networks; Fruits; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Transfer learning; Common disease; Contrast Enhancement; Field crops; Identification method; Image processing technique; Image-based; Plant disease; Spread of disease; Deep learning","","","","Iqbal, Zahid, An automated detection and classification of citrus plant diseases using image processing techniques: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 12-32, (2018); Prasad, Shitala, Multi-resolution mobile vision system for plant leaf disease diagnosis, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 10, 2, pp. 379-388, (2016); Es-saady, Youssef, Automatic recognition of plant leaves diseases based on serial combination of two SVM classifiers, pp. 561-566, (2016); Srunitha, K., Mango leaf unhealthy region detection and classification, Lecture Notes in Computational Vision and Biomechanics, 28, pp. 422-436, (2018); Sethupathy, Jayaprakash, OpenCV based disease identification of mango leaves, International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 8, 5, pp. 1990-1998, (2016); Singh, Vijai, Detection of plant leaf diseases using image segmentation and soft computing techniques, Information Processing in Agriculture, 4, 1, pp. 41-49, (2017); Zhang, Shanwen, Leaf image based cucumber disease recognition using sparse representation classification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 134, pp. 135-141, (2017); Mohanty, Sharada Prasanna, Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, September, (2016); Ferentinos, Konstantinos P., Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 145, pp. 311-318, (2018); Sladojević, Srdjan M., Deep Neural Networks Based Recognition of Plant Diseases by Leaf Image Classification, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2016, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 IEEE Conference on Sustainable Utilization and Development in Engineering and Technologies, CSUDET 2019","","Penang","163824","","9781728132761","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094634072"

Recently, with the advanced technology of smart meters, both active and reactive power outputs of PV inverters are tuned to optimize network operation e.g. minimizing network loss and PVs' active power curtailment in centralized methods. However, searching the optimal output of PVs in a large feasible operational region along with several variables due to the increasing number of PV systems requires a centralized controller much time to converge and cannot efficiently catch up with the change of PVs' output in the real operation. In this paper, by narrowing the searching region, boundary optimal inverter dispatch method is proposed. More reliable simulation outputs are obtained within a shorter calculation time, making the proposed method more applicable in the practical operation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Optimal Power Flow; Photovoltaic (pv) Systems; Power Distribution; Power Quality; Reactive Power Control; Electric Inverters; Electric Load Flow; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Power Quality; Reactive Power; Real Time Systems; Active And Reactive Power; Advanced Technology; Centralized Controllers; Medium-voltage Distribution Systems; Optimal Power Flows; Optimal Power Output; Photovoltaic Systems; Power Distributions; Power Control","Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Power quality; Reactive power; Real time systems; Active and Reactive Power; Advanced technology; Centralized controllers; Medium-voltage distribution systems; Optimal power flows; Optimal power output; Photovoltaic systems; Power distributions; Power control","","","","Canova, Aldo, Electrical impact of photovoltaic plant in distributed network, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 45, 1, pp. 341-347, (2009); Siti, Mukwanga Willy, Reconfiguration and load balancing in the LV and MV distribution networks for optimal performance, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 22, 4, pp. 2534-2540, (2007); Huat, Chua Kein, Energy storage system for mitigating voltage unbalance on low-voltage networks with photovoltaic systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 27, 4, pp. 1783-1790, (2012); Liu, Xiaohu, Coordinated control of distributed energy storage system with tap changer transformers for voltage rise mitigation under high photovoltaic penetration, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 2, pp. 897-906, (2012); Hossain, Mohammed Imran, Investigation of the interaction between step voltage regulators and large-scale photovoltaic systems regarding voltage regulation and unbalance, IET Renewable Power Generation, 10, 3, pp. 299-309, (2016); Farivar, Masoud, Optimal inverter VAR control in distribution systems with high PV penetration, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, (2012); Dall’Anese, Emiliano, Optimal dispatch of photovoltaic inverters in residential distribution systems, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 2, pp. 487-497, (2014); Šulc, Petr, Optimal distributed control of reactive power via the alternating direction method of multipliers, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 29, 4, pp. 968-977, (2014); Demirok, Erhan, Local reactive power control methods for overvoltage prevention of distributed solar inverters in low-voltage grids, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 1, 2, pp. 174-182, (2011); Su, Xiangjing, Optimal PV inverter reactive power control and real power curtailment to improve performance of unbalanced four-wire LV distribution networks, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 3, pp. 967-977, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering (CSEE); IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES)","2019 IEEE Sustainable Power and Energy Conference, iSPEC 2019","","Beijing","157236","","9781728149301","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079509594"

However, this issue has not been paid much attention in Vietnam, even though SMEs account for about 95% of total enterprises and the financial market of the country has not been well developed. This study investigates the causal effects of access to finance on productivity of SMEs operating in the manufacturing sector in Vietnam. Productivity was measured as the total factor productivity (TFP) obtained by production function estimation using the Levinsohn and Petrin approach. Regarding financial accessibility, two factors covered the extent to which firms might have a bank loan or overdraft facility were employed. To study the causal inferences of access to finance on firm productivity, the research adopted the difference-in-differences (DID) approach, as well as the propensity score matching (PSM) coupled with DID technique. The empirical results indicated that improving the financial accessibility could directly enhance firm productivity. Particularly, it was shown that firms having access to a bank loan could significantly improve TFP by approximately 8.6% in the DID model and about 9% in the PSM-DID model. Meanwhile, the firm average TFP increased by approximately 12.3% and 15.7% in simple DID and PSM-DID models, respectively, when firms had an overdraft facility. These findings suggest that the government should put more effort into assisting SMEs in generating bankable projects, and create a sound and healthy financial environment to stimulate firms' access to finance, which will ensure their sustainability and growth. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access To Finance; Difference-in-differences; Propensity Score Matching; Total Factor Productivity; Vietnamese Small And Medium Enterprises; Financial Market; Financial Services; Industrial Production; Manufacturing; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; State Role; Sustainability; Total Factor Productivity; Viet Nam","financial market; financial services; industrial production; manufacturing; small and medium-sized enterprise; state role; sustainability; total factor productivity; Viet Nam","","","","Finance for all Policies and Pitfalls in Expanding Access, (2008); Hallward-Driemeier, Mary, Ownership, investment climate and firm performance: Evidence from Chinese firms, Economics of Transition, 14, 4, pp. 629-647, (2006); Sleuwaegen, Leo, Growth of firms in developing countries, evidence from Côte d'Ivoire, Journal of Development Economics, 68, 1, pp. 117-135, (2002); Ayyagari, Meghana, How important are financing constraints?

One explanation for this is an underestimation of the environmental and economic values of these practices. The present study aimed at estimating environmental and technical efficiencies for all methods of rice production and then comparing each method in terms of efficiencies and economic benefits. Survey data included responses from farmers who used either eco-friendly or conventional rice cultivation methods. Latent class stochastic frontier analysis shows that the average technical efficiency across all methods was 85.02% and environmental efficiency across all methods was 22.58%. Among individual methods, floating rice had the highest technical and environmental efficiency scores. Ecologically engineered rice had the lowest economic and environmental performance. The average environmental efficiency of conventional rice production was 16.25%, which is significantly higher than that of ecologically engineered rice, large-scale rice, and GlobalGAP rice. The results indicate considerable overuse of agrochemical inputs and also point to other specific factors of production that influence these efficiencies.

The core functionalities of the system are partly based on recommendation methods. The first task is the prediction of student performance to help them estimate their performances on selected courses. These predicted results help students choose courses that are appropriate for them to get higher scores. Second, the system will automatically build a study strategy for next two years or even entirely four academic years based on their ability and related information. Our system also provides students a general view of their learning status: profile, grades, taken courses, credits, important school news, time table, etc. By using these functionalities, students will have a guidance and an up-to-date studying path to follow, as well as efficiently complete their school work. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Recommender System; Student Performance Prediction; Study Strategy","","","","This work was fully supported by the Project QG.15.29 and Project QG.16.34 from Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU).

Especially in a fast-changing world where knowledge about nature and society is in a constant state of flux, book reading helps students foster skills such as thinking, valuing, adaptability and creativity for sustainable development. This research study used a dataset of 1676 observations of junior high school students from Northern Vietnam to explore students' academic achievement and its association with their reading passion, family socio economic condition, parental education and occupational aspiration. The empirical results show that higher grades in STEM-related subjects are predicted by reading interest (β<inf>Readbook</inf> = 0.425, p < 0.0001), with students who love reading books achieve higher score than those who take no interest in books. Remarkably, the education level of the mother strongly enhances academic performance, with β = 0.721 (p < 0.0001) in cases of mother having a university diploma or higher. Students coming from wealthy families are more likely to buy books whereas borrowing from the library is the main source of books for students who grow up in not-rich families. However, even among wealthy families, investment into buying books still rely more on personal interest, despite the aforementioned educational benefits of book reading, as evidenced by an over 7 percentage point disparity between the likelihood of purchasing books among wealthy-family students who took an interest in reading (45%) versus students of the same background who did not like to read (38.7%).

The inherent weaknesses of this standard model such as quantization error, unstructured representation, burstiness phenomenon are to some extent solved. However, it has a serious problem of searching small objects on a database with cluttered background. In many situations, even the irrelevant objects which share the same texture or shape with a query object get higher score than relevant ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel fusion method to significantly boost the accuracy of instance search systems. Firstly, we use the state-of-the-art object detector with denser feature for finding object bounding box and similarity score. Secondly, to exploit the spatial relationship of each visual word with an object proposal, a detected area that might contain a query object, we define three categories of visual word pairs, i.e., discriminative, weak relevant, and context inferred ones. Finally, we propose a new re-ranking scheme with three weighting functions corresponding to the three categories of visual word pairs to compute the final similarity score between a query topic and a video shot. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on datasets which have a wide variety of types of query objects. Experimental results on TRECVID Instance Search datasets (INS2013 and INS2014) show the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bag-of-visual-word Model; Object Proposal; Spatial Fusion; Video Instance Search","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2017-26-01 and University of Dayton under STEM Catalyst Grant.","Arandjelović, Relja, Three things everyone should know to improve object retrieval, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2911-2918, (2012); IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, (2017); Awad, George, Instance search retrospective with focus on TRECVID, International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 6, 1, (2017); Cao, Yang, Spatial-bag-of-features, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3352-3359, (2010); Chum, Ondřej, Total recall II: Query expansion revisited, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 889-896, (2011); Chum, Ondřej, Total recall: Automatic query expansion with a generative feature model for object retrieval, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, (2007); Crowley, Elliot J., The state of the art: Object retrieval in paintings using discriminative regions, (2014); Felzenszwalb, Pedro F., Object detection with discriminatively trained part-based models, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 32, 9, pp. 1627-1645, (2010); Jégou, Hervé, Hamming embedding and weak geometric consistency for large scale image search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5302 LNCS, PART 1, pp. 304-317, (2008); Trecvid, (2013)","","Springer London","","","","","","2192662X; 21926611","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065184857"

However, there is no study on profit efficiency of safe tea producers, which are therefore barriers for farmers and policymakers in terms of extending the safe tea production practice in Vietnam. Thus, this study investigated the profit efficiency of tea production practices using a stochastic profit frontier function. We applied propensity score matching to control for self-selection in assessing the profit efficiency of safe and conventional tea farming. Our results indicated that the average profit efficiency of tea farmers was around 74%, suggesting 26% of profit was lost due to inefficiency. Furthermore, significant different profit efficiency was observed between the two farmer groups. We further found that tea farmers with larger production scale, better irrigation system, accessing extension service are more likely to adopt safe tea practices than others are. Thus, public policies should focus on improving profit efficiency and facilitating adoption of eco-friendly production practice, and also supporting innovations to improve farmers’ production conditions, including the access to extension service, irrigation system, enlarged farm size, and labor-saving machinery. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Profit Efficiency; Propensity Score Matching; Safe Tea; Vietgap; Vietnam; Agricultural Worker; Crop Production; Farm Size; Governance Approach; Irrigation System; Profitability; Standard (regulation); Stochasticity; Tea","agricultural worker; crop production; farm size; governance approach; irrigation system; profitability; standard (regulation); stochasticity; tea","","","","Abdulai, Awudu Mumin, Structural adjustment and economic efficiency of rice farmers in Northern Ghana, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 48, 3, pp. 503-520, (2000); Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Wasim Aktar, Md, Impact of pesticides use in agriculture: Their benefits and hazards, Interdisciplinary Toxicology, 2, 1, pp. 1-12, (2009); Ali, Mubarak, Economic efficiency of small farmers in a changing world: A survey of recent evidence, Journal of International Development, 3, 1, pp. 1-27, (1991); Ali, Mubarik, Profit efficiency among Basmati rice producers in Pakistan Punjab, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 71, 2, pp. 303-310, (1989); Arnade, Carlos Anthony, Estimating a profit function in the presence of inefficiency: An application to Russian agriculture, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 27, 1, pp. 94-113, (2002); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Caliendo, Marco, Some practical guidance for the implementation of propensity score matching, Journal of Economic Surveys, 22, 1, pp. 31-72, (2008); Economics of Food Safety the Case of Green Onions and Hepatitis A Outbreaks, (2025)","","Springer Netherlands rbk@louisiana.edu","","","","","","15732975; 1387585X","","EDSNB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042105265"

However, in a developing country like Vietnam, statistics have reported a low figure in book reading: only 1.2 books a year. This research study used a dataset of 1676 observations of junior high school students from Northern Vietnam to explore students' reading behavior and its association with demographic factors, and the family's reading culture. Data analysis suggests the older the student gets, the less inclined they are to read, and being female and having hobbies of low sensory stimulation are linked to higher preference for reading. Regarding scholarly culture at home, students who read more varied types of books and spend more time on books are correlated with higher reading interest. Reading habits are also positively reinforced by the capacity to access books and parental book reading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Education For Sustainable Developments; Gender; Junior High School Students; Reading Abilities; Reading Practices; Sustainable Education; Vietnam; Culture; Data Interpretation; Data Set; Developing World; Education; Gender; Sexuality; Student; Sustainable Development; Textbook; Viet Nam","culture; data interpretation; data set; developing world; education; gender; sexuality; student; sustainable development; textbook; Viet Nam","","","","Quality Education; Ritchie, Stuart J., Does Learning to Read Improve Intelligence?

Uniform rice seedlings of a high-yield variety (Oryza sativa L., cv. Bekoaoba) were transplanted in five treatments to examine different TWW irrigation directions (""bottom-to-top"" and ""top-to-top"" irrigation) and fertilization practices (with and without P-synthetic fertilizers) as well as one control that simulated the irrigation and fertilization management of normal paddy fields. The highest rice yield (14.1 t ha-1), shoot dry mass (12.9 t ha-1), and protein content in brown rice (14.6%) were achieved using bottom-to-top irrigation, although synthetic fertilizers were not applied. In addition, this subsurface irrigation system could contribute to environmental protection by removing 85-90% of nitrogen from TWW more effectively than the top-to-top irrigation, which showed a removal efficiency of approximately 63%. No accumulation of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, Pb, Cr, and As) in the paddy soils was observed after TWW irrigation for five months, and the contents of these metals in the harvested brown rice were lower than the permissible limits recommended by international standards. A microbial fuel cell system (MFC) was installed in the cultivation system using graphite-felt electrodes to test the capacity of electricity generation; however, the electricity output was much lower than that reported in normal paddy fields. Bottom-to-top irrigation with TWW can be considered a potential practice to meet both water and nutrient demand for rice cultivation in order to achieve a very high yield and nutritional quality of cultivated rice without necessitating the application of synthetic fertilizers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bottom-to-top Irrigation; Continuous Irrigation; Microbial Fuel Cell (mfc); Nutritional Quality Of Rice; Rice For Animal Feeding; Synthetic Fertilizers; Animals; Fertilizers; Graphite Electrodes; Heavy Metals; Nitrogen Removal; Subirrigation; Synthetic Fuels; Wastewater Treatment; Animal Feeding; Electricity Generation; International Standards; Microbial Fuel Cells (mfcs); Municipal Wastewaters; Nutritional Qualities; Removal Efficiencies; Synthetic Fertilizers; Microbial Fuel Cells; Agricultural Soil; Cultivar; Cultivation; Diet; Environmental Protection; Fertilizer; Fertilizer Application; Fuel Cell; High Yielding Variety; Irrigation System; Paddy Field; Rice; Seedling; Animalia; Oryza Sativa","Animals; Fertilizers; Graphite electrodes; Heavy metals; Nitrogen removal; Subirrigation; Synthetic fuels; Wastewater treatment; Animal feeding; Electricity generation; International standards; Microbial fuel cells (MFCs); Municipal wastewaters; Nutritional qualities; Removal efficiencies; Synthetic fertilizers; Microbial fuel cells; agricultural soil; cultivar; cultivation; diet; environmental protection; fertilizer; fertilizer application; fuel cell; high yielding variety; irrigation system; paddy field; rice; seedling; Animalia; Oryza sativa","","","Funding text 1: We sincerely appreciate Division of Sewerage in Tsuruoka City Government and Tsuruoka Branch of Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) for their strong supports as collaborators in this study.

The present study investigates how car-related factors affect the establishment of bus use intention in a psychological investigation. It is hypothesized that single car use factors do not directly influence bus use intention, rather than that; they indirectly influence bus use intention through an overall factor of car use. Results from a dataset of 270 samples investigating three types of daily trips in the Japanese context showed support to the mediating effect of the overall car use factor.

The analytical results confirm the closed linkage between TQM, JIT production practices and flexibility performance. Moreover, this study indicates that the effect of JIT production practices on flexibility performance can be strengthened with a higher level of TQM practices. The main findings of this study suggest that flexibility performance can be built up by implementing both TQM and JIT production practices, and TQM should be regarded as the platform to maximize the effect of JIT production on flexibility performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Empirical Study; Flexibility; Just-in-time (jit); Manufacturing; Moderation; Total Quality Management (tqm); Data Acquisition; Empirical Analysis; Manufacturing; Quality Control; Regression Analysis; Sustainable Development; Finland; Germany; Israel; Italy; Japan; Korea; Spain; Sweden; Taiwan; United Kingdom","data acquisition; empirical analysis; manufacturing; quality control; regression analysis; sustainable development; Finland; Germany; Israel; Italy; Japan; Korea; Spain; Sweden; Taiwan; United Kingdom","","","Funding: \u201CThis research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.02-2016.04\u201D.","Iqbal, Tahir, Agile manufacturing relationship building with TQM, JIT, and firm performance: An exploratory study in apparel export industry of Pakistan, International Journal of Production Economics, 203, pp. 24-37, (2018); Mishra, Ruchi, Empirical assessment of factors influencing potential of manufacturing flexibility in organization, Business Process Management Journal, 24, 1, pp. 158-182, (2018); Chaudhuri, Atanu, Supply chain integration, risk management and manufacturing flexibility, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 38, 3, pp. 690-712, (2018); García-Alcaraz, J.

This issue has been paid even greater attention in developing countries that aspire to reach sustainable transportation development goals in the era of urbanization and globalization. In this study, the multinomial logit model, neural networks and random forest were applied to examine the features' impact level and to also predict vehicle ownership patterns in Phnom Penh city. The empirical results indicate that household income is the most powerful variable affecting motorization in Phnom Penh. Supplementation of individual trip characteristics such as total number of trips made, number of trips made for work purposes and overall travel distance all make effective contributions as classifiers. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that the machine-learning approach outperformed not only in terms of predicting accuracy, but also in dealing with unbalanced categories when compared with the statistical approach.

National road networks function as capital and infrastructure investments that are necessary catalysts for countries’ development, while requiring the extraction of vast amounts of construction materials for expansion and maintenance causing environmental impacts. However, there has so far been little research on the subject, especially in developing countries. We compile material stock and flow accounts for Vietnam's roads from 2003 to 2013 on the national and provincial levels, finding that approximately 40% of the domestic consumption of construction materials is for expanding and maintaining the road network, and the materials stocked in the road network doubled from 1,321 million metric tons in 2003 to 2,660 million metric tons in 2012. Material stock growth rates closely resembled those of gross domestic product (GDP) in this period, suggesting a codependency of physical infrastructure development and economic development. On the provincial level, our results show local disparities in the stock and its capacity to support the transportation of passengers and freight, especially considering the surging growth of vehicles in urban centers. By showcasing the challenges of conducting a material flow and stock analysis in a developing country, this study not only sheds light on Vietnam's transportation material stock and its policy implications, but also serves as a case study for further work in similar countries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction Materials; Developing Countries; Material Stock; Road Network; Transport Infrastructure; Vietnam; Building Materials; Developing Countries; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Environmental Impact; Investments; Motor Transportation; Public Policy; Roads And Streets; Urban Growth; Urban Transportation; Domestic Consumption; Economic Development; Gross Domestic Products; Infrastructure Development; Infrastructure Investment; Road Network; Transport Infrastructure; Viet Nam; Materials Handling; Construction Material; Developing World; Economic Development; Environmental Impact; Gross Domestic Product; Material Flow Analysis; Policy Making; Road Transport; Stock Assessment; Transportation Infrastructure","Building materials; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Investments; Motor transportation; Public policy; Roads and streets; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Domestic consumption; Economic development; Gross domestic products; Infrastructure development; Infrastructure investment; Road network; Transport infrastructure; Viet Nam; Materials handling; construction material; developing world; economic development; environmental impact; Gross Domestic Product; material flow analysis; policy making; road transport; stock assessment; transportation infrastructure","","","This research was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1711) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, and the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency.","Akenji, Lewis, Making sustainable consumption and production the core of sustainable development goals, Sustainability (Switzerland), 6, 2, pp. 513-529, (2014); Public Policy and Governance Review, (2014); What Determines Demand for Freight Transport, (1992); Infrastructure Development for Asean Economic Integration, (2009); Mining Science and Technology Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Mining Science and Technology Xuzhou China 2022 October, (2004); Personal Communication with Toan Nguyen, (2016); Ekmekçi, Mehmet, Impact of quarries on karst groundwater systems, pp. 3-6, (1993); Elshkaki, Ayman, Dynamic stock modelling: A method for the identification and estimation of future waste streams and emissions based on past production and product stock characteristics, Energy, 30, 8 SPEC.

Multi-dike protection systems have been built to prevent flooding, and have supported agricultural intensification since the early 1990s. Semi-dike and full-dike systems have been used to grow double and triple rice, respectively. Only a small number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the water quality in the VMD. This study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of water quality inside the dike-protected area. Surface water samples were collected in the dry and wet seasons at 35 locations. We used multivariate statistical analyses to examine various water quality parameters. The mean concentrations of COD, NH<inf>4</inf> +, NO<inf>3</inf> -, PO<inf>4</inf> 3-, EC, and turbidity were significantly higher in water samples inside the full-dike system than in water samples from outside the full-dike systems and inside the semi-dike systems in both seasons. High concentrations of PO<inf>4</inf> 3- were detected in most of the primary canals along which residential, tourist areas and local markets were settled. However, NO<inf>3</inf> - was mainly found to be higher in secondary canals, where chemical fertilizers were used for rice intensification inside the dike system. Water control infrastructures are useful for preventing flood hazards.

This study aimed at validating the potential of an aquatic macrophyte Eleocharis acicularis for simultaneous removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions under different dissolved Si. The laboratory experiments designed for determining the removal efficiencies of heavy metals were conducted in the absence or presence of Si on a time scale up to 21 days. Eleocharis acicularis was transplanted into the solutions containing 0.5 mg L-1 of indium (In), gallium (Ga), silver (Ag), thallium (Tl), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) with various Si concentrations from 0 to 4.0 mg L-1. The results revealed that the increase of dissolved Si concentrations enhanced removal efficiencies of E. acicularis for Ga, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb, while this increase did not show a clear effect for In, Tl, and Ag. Our study presented a notable example of combining E. acicularis with dissolved Si for more efficient removals of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and Ga from aqueous solutions.

We use a dynamical downscaling method with a regional climate model coupled with an urban canopy scheme to run sensitivity simulations with LUC and AH data from 1990, 2010, and 2030. The LUC data in 1990 and 2010 are derived from remote sensing data, whereas the LUC data for 2030 come from the city's master plan. The AH data are estimated from past and projected energy-use conditions. The results show that the LUC-AH coupled changes during 2010–2030 will have much greater impact on the local UHI effect than those during 1990–2010. In the urban-core area, the monthly mean surface air temperature in July is predicted to increase by 0.7 °C by 2030, double the increase of 0.35 °C during 1990–2010. We show that the temperature increase during 1990–2010 is mostly due to the change in LUC conditions, but the increase in the future AH will contribute 30–50% to the total temperature increase in the urban areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Future Master Plan; Hanoi; Urban Heat Island; Urbanization; Wrf Model; Atmospheric Temperature; Land Use; Landforms; Remote Sensing; Thermal Pollution; Hanoi; Master Plan; Urban Heat Island; Urbanization; Wrf Model; Climate Models","Atmospheric temperature; Land use; Landforms; Remote sensing; Thermal pollution; Hanoi; Master plan; Urban heat island; Urbanization; WRF Model; Climate models","","","Numerical simulations of the present work were conducted under the Interdisciplinary Computational Science Program at the Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba.

This information posses two important values in that (i) it reflects the content of an event and (ii) it shares hidden topics with sentences in the main document. In this paper, we present a novel model to capture the nature of relationships between document sentences and post information (comments or tweets) in sharing hidden topics for summarization of Web documents by utilizing relevant post information. Unlike previous methods which are usually based on hand-crafted features, our approach ranks document sentences and user posts based on their importance to the topics. The sentence-user-post relation is formulated in a share topic matrix, which presents their mutual reinforcement support. Our proposed matrix co-factorization algorithm computes the score of each document sentence and user post and extracts the top ranked document sentences and comments (or tweets) as a summary. We apply the model to the task of summarization on three datasets in two languages, English and Vietnamese, of social context summarization and also on DUC 2004 (a standard corpus of the traditional summarization task).

Oldenburg’s “third place” concept is deployed as a framework to explore the role of the bookstore-café in Hangzhou, China, based on a study conducted at three popular bookstore-cafés in central Hangzhou, to clarify its involvement in urban life. As part of the study, we used the observational method to help determine consumers’ visual behavior and an on-site survey questionnaire to collect data for measuring the qualities of the bookstore-café.

Optimal threshold for segmentation procedure is selected from rate of change-local variance graph. Object-based fuzzy approach is implemented to identify LULC classes and LULC initial sets, and then the initial sets are classified to final LULC classes. In case of Lao Cai area, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), water index (WI) in object-based are used to generated water, terrace field classes, and built-up and vegetation sets. NDVI, soil index (SI) and red band are used to distinguish built-up set to building, bare land and road classes. NDVI and RedEgde band are inputs to classify rice field and forest classes from vegetation set. In case of Can Tho area, NDWI and WI are generated to water, vegetation, paddy field classes and built-up set, and then built-up set is classified to building, bare land, road, and paddy field classes.

To reveal what determines the overuse of antibiotics, we interviewed 201 shrimp farmers in Viet Nam in 2015 and collected shrimp samples from each household’s pond for the screening of residual drugs. These tests revealed that residual drugs exceeding acceptable limits by Japanese standards were found in the samples of 40 farmers. We conducted cross-sectional Logit and Tobit regressions to examine whether results of the residue tests are significantly associated with farmers’ characteristics and management practices. This study finds that: (1) receiving BMP training has a significant and positive effect on reducing residual drugs; (2) if farmers know multiple extension officers, these relationships have significant and positive effects on reducing residual drugs; and (3) farmers with experience of shrimp disease outbreaks reduce use of antibiotics. Overall, this study contributes to revealing the determinants of detecting veterinary drug residues in shrimp farming in multiple (social, economic and psychological) dimensions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Better Management Practices; Hyperbolic Consumer; Risk Preference; Shrimp Aquaculture; Veterinary Drug; Agricultural Worker; Antibiotics; Best Management Practice; Consumption Behavior; Risk Perception; Shrimp Culture; Viet Nam; Decapoda (crustacea)","agricultural worker; antibiotics; best management practice; consumption behavior; risk perception; shrimp culture; Viet Nam; Decapoda (Crustacea)","","","Funding text 1: Financial supports from the Murata Science Foundation, JSPS Kakenhi Grant Numbers JP15H05179 and JP25101003, and the Institute of Developing Economies-Japan External Trade Organization are acknowledged.; Funding text 2: Financial supports from the Murata Science Foundation, JSPS Kakenhi Grant Numbers JP15H05179 and JP25101003, and the Institute of Developing Economies-Japan External Trade Organization are acknowledged.

The use of a cascade model suggests a progressive pattern, starting from emotion perception, followed by emotional understanding and emotion regulation, with downstream effects on job performance. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of both measurements, we employed the performance-based ability measurement, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and the self-reporting ability EI measurement, Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS). Our findings supported the cascade model, but in the case of WLEIS measures, both self-emotion appraisal and others' emotion appraisal precede emotion regulation, leading to a positive effect on job performance. Moreover, CI moderated the relationship between EI and job performance, such that a decline in CI rendered the relationship more positive. The MSCEIT and WLEIS showed similar results, thus supporting the cascading model and moderating effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cascading Model; Cognitive Intelligence; Compensatory Model; Emotional Intelligence; Emotional Intelligence Measurement; Artificial Intelligence; Cognition; Job Search; Measurement Method; Numerical Model; Perception; Performance Assessment; Psychology","artificial intelligence; cognition; job search; measurement method; numerical model; perception; performance assessment; psychology","","","","Farh, Crystal I.Chien, Emotional Intelligence, Teamwork Effectiveness, and Job Performance: The Moderating Role of Job Context, Journal of Applied Psychology, 97, 4, pp. 890-900, (2012); Sy, Thomas, Relation of employee and manager emotional intelligence to job satisfaction and performance, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 68, 3, pp. 461-473, (2006); Wong, Chi Sum, The effects of leader and follower emotional intelligence on performance and attitude: An exploratory study, Leadership Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 243-274, (2002); International Journal of Business and Management, (2016); Day, Arla L., Using an ability-based measure of emotional intelligence to predict individual performance, group performance, and group citizenship behaviours, Personality and Individual Differences, 36, 6, pp. 1443-1458, (2004); Kluemper, Donald H., Emotion Management Ability: Predicting Task Performance, Citizenship, and Deviance, Journal of Management, 39, 4, pp. 878-905, (2013); Joseph, Dana L., Emotional Intelligence: An Integrative Meta-Analysis and Cascading Model, Journal of Applied Psychology, 95, 1, pp. 54-78, (2010); Cǒté, Stéphane, Emotional intelligence, cognitive intelligence, and job performance, Administrative Science Quarterly, 51, 1, pp. 1-28, (2006); Palmer, Benjamin R., A psychometric evaluation of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test Version 2.0, Intelligence, 33, 3, pp. 285-305, (2005); Rossen, Eric A., Confirmatory factor analysis of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test V 2.0 (MSCEIT), Personality and Individual Differences, 44, 5, pp. 1258-1269, (2008)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066847398"

This paper has the objective of clarifying the effects of soil hydraulic conductivity and rainfall intensity on riverbank stability using numerical analysis with the GeoSlope program. The initial saturation condition is first indicated as the main factor affecting riverbank stability. Analyzing high-saturation conditions, the obtained result can be used to build an understanding of the mechanics of riverbank stability and the effect of both the rainfall intensity and soil hydraulic conductivity. Firstly, the rainfall intensity is lower than the soil hydraulic conductivity; the factor of safety (FOS) reduces with changes in the groundwater table, which is a result of rainwater infiltration and unsteady state flow through the unsaturated soil. Secondly, the rainfall intensity is slightly higher than the soil hydraulic conductivity, the groundwater table rises slowly, and the FOS decreases with both changes in the wetting front and groundwater table. Thirdly, the rainfall intensity is much higher than the soil hydraulic conductivity, and the FOS decreases dominantly by the wetting front and pond loading area. Finally, in cases with no pond, the FOS reduces when the rainfall intensity is lower than hydraulic conductivity. With low hydraulic conductivity, the wetting front is on a shallow surface and descends very slowly. The decreasing of FOS is only due to transient seepage changes of the unsaturated soil properties by losing soil suction and shear strength. These obtained results not only build a clearer understanding of the filtration mechanics but also provide a helpful reference for riverbank protection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hydraulic Conductivity; Rainfall Intensity; Riverbank Stability; Bank Protection; Groundwater; Lakes; Rain; Safety Factor; Seepage; Shear Strength; Soils; Stability; Water Levels; Wetting; Effects Of Rainfalls; Ground Water Table; Rainfall Infiltration; Rainfall Intensity; Rainwater Infiltrations; Saturation Conditions; Soil Hydraulic Conductivity; Unsteady-state Flow; Hydraulic Conductivity; Assessment Method; Hydraulic Conductivity; Precipitation Intensity; River Bank; Saturation; Seepage; Soil Water; Stability Analysis; Water Level; Water Table","Bank protection; Groundwater; Lakes; Rain; Safety factor; Seepage; Shear strength; Soils; Stability; Water levels; Wetting; Effects of rainfalls; Ground water table; Rainfall infiltration; Rainfall intensity; Rainwater infiltrations; Saturation conditions; Soil hydraulic conductivity; Unsteady-state flow; Hydraulic conductivity; assessment method; hydraulic conductivity; precipitation intensity; river bank; saturation; seepage; soil water; stability analysis; water level; water table","","","Acknowledgments: This paper was completed with the support of the project Code 105.08-2015.24, which was sponsored by Nafosted, Ministry of Science and Technology, Vietnam, and the support by Geotechnical Laboratory, Ibaraki University, Japan to determine unsaturated soil properties.

The present study investigates changes in flood extremes in the future using downscaled CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5) high-resolution ensemble projections of near-term climate for the Upper Thu Bon catchment in Vietnam. Model bias correction techniques are utilized to improve the daily rainfall simulated by the multi-model climate experiments. The corrected rainfall is then used to drive a calibrated supper-tank model for runoff simulations. The flood extremes are analyzed based on the Gumbel extreme value distribution and simulation of design hydrograph methods. Results show that the former method indicates almost no changes in the flood extremes in the future compared to the baseline climate. However, the later method explores increases (approximately 20%) in the peaks of very extreme events in the future climate, especially, the flood peak of a 50-year return period tends to exceed the flood peak of a 100-year return period of the baseline climate. Meanwhile, the peaks of shorter return period floods (e.g., 10-year) are projected with a very slight change. Model physical parameterization schemes and spatial resolution seem to cause larger uncertainties; while different model runs show less sensitivity to the future projections. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calibrated Supper-tank Model; High-resolution; Multi-model Climate Experiments; Near-term Climate; Rainfall And Flood Extremes; Catchments; Climate Change; Flood Control; Floods; Rain; Runoff; Settling Tanks; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Extreme Value Distributions; Future Projections; High Resolution; Multi Model; Near-term Climate; Physical Parameterization; Tank Models; Climate Models; Assessment Method; Calibration; Catchment; Climate Change; Cmip; Ensemble Forecasting; Extreme Event; Flood; Hydrological Modeling; Rainfall; Rainfall-runoff Modeling; Return Period; River Basin; Runoff; Thu Bon River; Viet Nam","Catchments; Climate change; Flood control; Floods; Rain; Runoff; Settling tanks; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Extreme value distributions; Future projections; High resolution; Multi model; Near-term climate; Physical parameterization; Tank models; Climate models; assessment method; calibration; catchment; climate change; CMIP; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; flood; hydrological modeling; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; return period; river basin; runoff; Thu Bon River; Viet Nam","","","Acknowledgments: This work was financially supported by Vietnam’s National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) for a basic research project (Code: 105.08-2014.23).","Hirabayashi, Yukiko, Global flood risk under climate change, Nature Climate Change, 3, 9, pp. 816-821, (2013); Wilby, Robert L., Climate change and fluvial flood risk in the UK: More of the same?, Hydrological Processes, 22, 14, pp. 2511-2523, (2008); Milly, Paul Chris D., Increasing risk of great floods in a changing climate, Nature, 415, 6871, pp. 514-517, (2002); Ulbrich, Uwe, The central European floods of August 2002: Part 1 – Rainfall periods and flood development, Weather, 58, 10, pp. 371-377, (2003); Fowler, Anthony M., Potential impacts of global warming on the frequency and magnitude of heavy precipitation, Natural Hazards, 11, 3, pp. 283-303, (1995); Prudhomme, Christel, Downscaling of global climate models for flood frequency analysis: Where are we now?, Hydrological Processes, 16, 6, pp. 1137-1150, (2002); Fowler, Hayley J., New estimates of future changes in extreme rainfall across the UK using regional climate model integrations. 1.

However, the mainstream consideration following Berry's model on acculturation does not take into account whether students of the host countries are immune to these problems. This study aims to examine the prevalence and predictors of help-seeking behaviors among international and domestic students in a multicultural environment by employing ANOVA and polynomial regression. Some significant results from this study are: (1) Informal sources were the most prevalent sources of help-seeking among international and domestic students, while formal help-seeking was not popular; (2) international students were more likely to overcome emotional difficulties alone and seek help on the Internet than domestic students; (3) acculturative stress was a positive predictor of formal, informal, and miscellaneous help-seeking behaviors among international students and informal help-seeking behaviors or among domestic students; and (4) depression was negatively correlated with the willingness of international students to seek help from informal sources. The findings hint at the risk of acculturative stress faced by domestic students in a multicultural environment being overlooked and the lack of help-seeking sources for international students. The study also provides empirical evidence for policy-planners to design a sustainable education system better at supporting students dealing with depression and acculturative stress. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acculturative Stress; Depression; Help-seeking; Higher Education; International Student; International University; Internationalization; Japan; Social Connectedness; Sustainable Education; Education; Higher Education; Internet; Mental Health; Student; Sustainability; University Sector; Japan","education; higher education; Internet; mental health; student; sustainability; university sector; Japan","","","","Inbound Internationally Mobile Students by Country of Origin, (2018); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2012); Pekerti, Andre A., Double edge experiences of expatriate acculturation: Navigating through personal multiculturalism, Journal of Global Mobility, 5, 3, pp. 225-250, (2017); National Survey of Counseling Center Directors, (2009); Hunt, Justin B., Mental Health Problems and Help-Seeking Behavior Among College Students, Journal of Adolescent Health, 46, 1, pp. 3-10, (2010); Nguyen, Minh Hoang, Depression, Acculturative Stress, and Social Connectedness among international university students in Japan: A statistical investigation, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 3, (2019); Perspectives in Immigrant and Minority Education, (1983); Berry, John W., Immigration, acculturation, and adaptation, Applied Psychology, 46, 1, pp. 5-34, (1997); Vuong, Quan Hoang, The (ir)rational consideration of the cost of science in transition economies, Nature Human Behaviour, 2, 1, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064036224"

We used data from a farm-household survey comprising of 70 contract and 96 noncontract respondents, and apply the Student's t-test and ordinary least square regression model for data analysis. We found that farmers with larger rice plantations are unlikely to engage in contract farming, and that market outlets and output price for contract growers tend to be ensured compared with noncontract ones. The findings reveal that contract farming has a significantly positive impact on rice-farming profitability in terms of average return and average rate of return on variable cost when controlling for observable characteristics of household and farm. The results suggest that contract farming may enable rice farmers to raise their rice income as well as household income. The policy implication may be that contract farming may not be feasible for all rice farmers and rice business firms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Average Rate Of Return; Contract Farming; Mekong Delta; Return; Rice; Contract Farming; Crop Yield; Household Survey; Least Squares Method; Policy Implementation; Profitability; Return Period; Rice; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","contract farming; crop yield; household survey; least squares method; policy implementation; profitability; return period; rice; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","","Barrett, Christopher B., Smallholder participation in contract farming: Comparative evidence from five countries, World Development, 40, 4, pp. 715-730, (2012); Bellemare, Marc F., As You Sow, So Shall You Reap: The Welfare Impacts of Contract Farming, World Development, 40, 7, pp. 1418-1434, (2012); Bolwig, Simon, The Economics of Smallholder Organic Contract Farming in Tropical Africa, World Development, 37, 6, pp. 1094-1104, (2009); Journal of Southeast Asian Economies, (2013); Vietnam and Lesson Learnt from Chiba Prefecture Japan, (2014); Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research, (2017); Dedehouanou, Senakpon Fidèle Ange, Does contracting make farmers happy?

Therefore, improving productivity in agriculture is indispensable to the sustainability of the country. This research examined productivity and its determinants from 420 enterprises operating in agriculture. Productivity was measured as the total factor productivity (TFP) obtained from fixed and random effects models. The determinants of TFP including size and age, share of state and foreign ownership, export, accessibility to Internet and bank loan of firms, controlled for year fixed effects, were analyzed. It was shown that 74.6% companies in the agricultural sector were small in size (< 10 < 200 employees). Although the number of large firms (>300 employees) explained 10.6%, they had a remarkable and positive TFP (38.8%, p < 0.01), while both small and very small (<10, and <200 employees, respectively) had strikingly negative TFP values (−71.3% and −32.1%, respectively, p < 0.01), as compared to the medium sizes (< 200 < 300 employees). It was also revealed that although foreign ownership was only 3.8% on average, it had a notably positive effect on TFP (55.0%, p < 0.01). In contrast, state ownership accounted for 30.7%, but it had a negative influence on TFP (−7.5%). The export contributed a negligible and statistically significant effect to TFP (2.6%), which might be attributed to a limited number of firms (4.5%) having mobility in agricultural export. 73% received a bank loan, and only 18.2% had access to the Internet, but both of them yielded remarkable TFP values (18.5%, p < 0.01 and 3.4%, p < 0.05 respectively). The Hausman test indicated that the fixed effects (FE) model was more effective than the random effects (RE) model to estimate the TFP. The findings of this study suggested that reform efforts should focus on improving the productivity of small agricultural enterprises. In addition, foreign investment, effective use of bank loan and Internet accessibility should be further enhanced. The results of this study may provide insights for policymakers who aim to improve the productivity in agricultural enterprises and thereby contribute to the sustainable growth of the country. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Sector; Firm Productivity; Fixed Effects; Random Effects; Total Factor Productivity","","","","","Aker, Jenny C., Mobile phones and economic development in Africa, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24, 3, pp. 207-232, (2010); Anik, Asif Reza, Agricultural Productivity Growth and the Role of Capital in South Asia (1980-2013), Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 3, (2017); Gifted Kids or Pushy Parents Foreign Acquisitions and Plant Performance in Indonesia, (2005); Dias Ávila, Antônio Flávio, Chapter 72 Total Factor Productivity Growth in Agriculture.

Ltd., Hanoi, Viet Nam","Difficulties in breeding new rice cultivars that have a high yield, are acceptable quality, and are tolerant to environmental stresses have been the major constraint of rice production in many developing countries, as these traits are determined by multiple genes associated with complicated and uncontrollable gene segregations.Furthermore, the gene/QTL (quantitative trait locus) introduced to the cultivar is unstable due to the interaction among the active genes, which determine the phenotypic performance, not yet been well understood or controllable. In this study, the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mutation was applied to the heterozygote of the F<inf>1</inf> generation from the cross between TBR<inf>1</inf> (female) and KD<inf>18</inf> (male parent). The phenotype and genotype of the M<inf>2</inf> and M<inf>3</inf> generations were evaluated and showed that the mutant population phenotypes, including the plant height, semi-dwarfism, amylose content, protein content, gel consistency, grain yield, and spikelet fertility, varied. Interestingly, no segregation among the genotypes in the M<inf>2</inf> andM<inf>3</inf> generations was observed, while the genotypes of the control population were either paternally inherited or indeterminable when using 28 polymorphism simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that were identified on parental lines from 200 markers. The MNU-induced mutation caused maternal inheritance in the segregating populations, as primarily important agronomic traits were maternally succeeded from the female line TBR<inf>1</inf>. The findings of this study indicated that, through the use of MNU, the breeding of rice cultivars with close genetic backgrounds (similarity coefficient = 0.52) could be shortened by the maternal control of important qualities, such as pest and disease resistance and high yield, thus contributing to sustainable rice production for rice farmers. Further examination of rice cultivars with a greater difference in the genetic background should be subsequently conducted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Important Agronomic Trait; Maternal Inheritance; Mnu Mutation; Rice; Rice Breeding; Ssr Marker; Sustainable Rice Production; Agronomy; Alternative Agriculture; Chemical Compound; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Cultivar; Developing World; Disease Resistance; Genetic Marker; Genotype; High Yielding Variety; Mutation; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Rice; Oryza Sativa","agronomy; alternative agriculture; chemical compound; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; developing world; disease resistance; genetic marker; genotype; high yielding variety; mutation; phenotype; plant breeding; rice; Oryza sativa","","","","Xuan, T.

Although several studies have investigated various aspects of the evacuation, little attention has been paid to examining where and why people moved to different evacuation locations. Based on the data collected from a questionnaire survey of 289 evacuees from Minamisoma City, this paper discusses the temporal-spatial features of the evacuation while emphasizing evacuation distances and the factors that influenced the selection of evacuation locations. The study found that people increased their evacuation distance from the nuclear power plant and reached their furthest evacuation destinations shortly after the accident. The fear of radiation exposure only has an impact on selecting evacuation locations briefly after the accident. The study found that evacuees whose home location was in the restricted areas, those engaged in permanent jobs, and those who had young children at the time of the nuclear accident tended to evacuate shorter distances. No statistical evidence has been found regarding the association between age, gender, or the educational and economic status of evacuees and evacuation destinations. The paper suggests that the decision regarding evacuation destinations is strongly driven by human networks and recommendations of local governments and acquaintances and is influenced less by job-related matters, safety from radiation exposure, accommodation availability, and convenient access to social amenities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disaster Migration; Evacuation Distance; Evacuation Location Selection; Fukushima Nuclear Accident; Temporal-spatial Patterns Of Evacuation","","","","This research was supported by the Hiroshima University Phoenix Leader Education Program (Hiroshima Initiative) for the Renaissance from Radiation Disaster and funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.","Science Reports of the Tohoku University 7th Series Geography, (2014); undefined, (2001); Bassett, Thomas J., Sudden shift or migratory drift?

The focus is on the mediating effects of affective commitment and knowledge sharing within the relationship. Design/methodology: Data were collected in Vietnam via questionnaire survey. Regarding survey administration, first, we chose the five biggest universities, which specialized in economics and business in Hanoi. Then, from those universities, we randomly selected graduate classes whose students are fulltime employees in various companies around Hanoi. The questionnaire included 5 point Likert scale multi-items designed to measure factors. Among 750 distributed questionnaires, 252 were returned. After screening and deleting those questionnaires with missing information or those from large companies, 199 remained for further investigation, representing 26.53% of the valid response rate. The sample included 117 manufacturing and 82 non-manufacturing companies. For the statistical analysis of the data, we followed the three-step procedure of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling. Findings: Results support our hypotheses that predict positive mediating effects, except for the direct relationship between training and development as one aspect of internal CSR and affective commitment, although training and development have an indirect relationship with organizational creativity through knowledge sharing. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature on internal CSR, especially because it provides the valid empirical evidence for the relationship between internal CSR and organizational creativity, which needs more clarification regarding the process. We emphasize the importance of findings to the case of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, because they often face difficulties implementing external CSR due to resource constraints. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affective Commitment; Internal Csr; Knowledge Sharing; Organizational Creativity; Small And Medium-sized Enterprises; Vietnam","","","","","International Journal of Human and Social Sciences, (2010); Allen, Natalie J., The measurement and antecedents of affective, continuance and normative commitment to the organization, Journal of Occupational Psychology, 63, 1, pp. 1-18, (1990); Allen, Natalie J., Affective, continuance, and normative commitment to the organization: An examination of construct validity, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 49, 3, pp. 252-276, (1996); Research in Organizational Behavior, (1988); Amabile, Teresa M., The Creative Environment Scales: Work Environment Inventory, Creativity Research Journal, 2, 4, pp. 231-253, (1989); Amabile, Teresa M., Assessing the work environment for creativity, Academy of Management Journal, 39, 5, pp. 1154-1184, (1996); Hr Corporate Social Responsibility Using Csr to Enhance Employee Engagement and Deliver Hr Objectives, (2007); Bharadwaj, Sundar G., Making innovation happen in organizations: Individual creativity mechanisms, organizational creativity mechanisms or both?, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 17, 6, pp. 424-434, (2000); Morality Moral Behavior and Moral Development, (1984); Moral Development an Introduction, (1995)","","OmniaScience ic.editor@intangiblecapital.org ETSEIAT Building TR6C/ Colom 11, 3rd floor Terrassa 08222","","","","","","16979818; 20143214","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079908063"

After applying the fixed effects regressions and the extended instrumental variable regressions with fixed effects, we find that foreign ownership decreases the volatility of stock returns. However, the stabilizing impact of foreign ownership on stock return volatility becomes weaker in large firms since the coefficient of the interaction term between firm size and foreign ownership turns out to be significantly positive. The estimated results remain robust when we use the future one-year volatility, other than the current one, as an alternative measure of the dependent variable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Governance; Firm Size; Foreign Ownership; Volatility","","","","","Adams, Renée B., A theory of friendly boards, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 217-250, (2007); Bae, Kee Hong, Investibility and return volatility, Journal of Financial Economics, 71, 2, pp. 239-263, (2004); Bartram, Söhnke M., Why Are U.S. Stocks More Volatile?, Journal of Finance, 67, 4, pp. 1329-1370, (2012); Batten, Jonathan A., Foreign ownership in emerging stock markets, Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 32-33, pp. 15-24, (2015); Bohl, Martin T., Do institutional investors destabilize stock prices? evidence from an emerging market, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 16, 4, pp. 370-383, (2006); Regression Analysis by Example, (2000); Chen, Zhi'An, Does foreign institutional ownership increase return volatility?

After the global economic crisis 2007-2011 and the recent post-low inflation 2014-2015, Viet Nam economies, its financial and stock market as well as renewable energy market experienced indirect and direct impacts on their operation, system and price. Although some economists have done researches on the relationship among macro economic factors such as: consumer price index (CPI), inflation, GDP…., this paper aims to consider the interaction between macro economic factors such as Viet Nam inflation and GDP growth rate, US inflation, exchange rate, risk free rate and other macro factors, and esp. their impacts on a big energy firm, in the context Viet Nam and the US economies receive impacts from global economic crisis. This is one main objective of this research paper. This research paper finds out firm stock price has a negative correlation with risk free rate in VN and deposit rate of VN commercial banks, but has a positive correlation with lending rate in Vietnam. And the statistical analysis will generate results which help us to suggest macro policies in favor of the local stock and financial market. Industrial risk over years has been affected much by macro economic risk, credit risk, and legal risk; therefore, government bodies need to issue proper macro economic legal, financial and credit policies in order to stimulate, develop stock market and reduce workload pressure for Vietnam bank system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rate; Inflation; Lending Rate; Price; Renewable Energy Industry; Risk Free Rate; Stock Market","","","","","Amity Journal of Finance, (2016); International Journal of Waste Resources, (2018); Studies in Business and Economics, (2017); Han, Jun, Pyrolysis characteristic and mechanism of waste tyre: A thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry analysis, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 129, pp. 1-5, (2018); Ijest, (2012); Apergis, Nicholas, Housing Prices and Macroeconomic Factors: Prospects within the European Monetary Union, International Real Estate Review, 6, 1, pp. 63-74, (2003); Atbu Journal of Environmental Technology, (2016); Int J Mater Sci Appl, (2014); Roy, Christian, Vacuum pyrolysis of used tires end-uses for oil and carbon black products, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 51, 1, pp. 201-221, (1999); Ang, Andrew, CAPM over the long run: 1926-2001, Journal of Empirical Finance, 14, 1, pp. 1-40, (2007)","","World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society wseas.headquarters@gmail.com Ag.

This article examines the views and experiences of local people in Cu Lao Cham MPA, Vietnam, with regard to tourism and poverty alleviation. Participant observation and semistructured interviews were conducted with 41 local people working in tourism. Results suggest that most respondents are involved in tourism and fishery simultaneously. Although tourism contributes significantly to respondents' living conditions and to the local economy overall (e.g., jobs creation for poor people and women), benefits are distributed unequally, which increases social conflicts. The challenges facing local people in participating in tourism include a lack of capital, lack of market access, and obstacles caused by local policies. This research suggests that locals' perceptions of tourism are important criteria for evaluating the tourism-poverty alleviation nexus. Additionally, in the context of MPAs, local attitudes may have an effect on conservation outcomes. Further research should consider the wider views of local people and other tourism stakeholders with regard to tourism, poverty, and conservation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cu Lao Cham; Marine Protected Areas (mpas); Perceived Tourism Benefits; Poverty Reduction; Pro-poor Tourism","","","","Funding text 1: The author would like to thank to Professor Carolin Funck from the Graduate School of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University, Japan and Dr. V.

It is located in the central province of Quang Nam, which is approximately 18 km offshore from Hoi An City (Fig. 1). There are four villages on the island consisting of about 2,500 people, with 600 households. In late 2005, Cu Lao Cham MPA was established under the authority of the Quang Nam Provincial People’s Committee (QNPPC) and was the outcome of the Cu Lao Cham MPA project, a livelihood support program that was funded by Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) (Brown, 2011). The primary objectives for establishing the MPA were to preserve the biodiversity value (i.e., protecting the fish and their ecosystem) and to improve the local livelihoods of Cu Lao Cham Island. Cu Lao Cham MPA covers an area of 6,710 ha and comprises both island nature reserve and protected marine waters (Nguyen, 2010). Due to its rich biodiversity value, in 2009 Cu Lao Cham was designated as UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve (WBR) (Nguyen, 2010).","Abdullah, Abdul Jabbar, Does education reduce income inequality?

Inspired by this computational movement, this study uses Bayesian networks analysis, combining both the frequentist and the Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, to investigate the highly representative elements in the cultural evolution of a Vietnamese city's architecture in the early 20th century. With a focus on the façade design of 68 old houses in Hanoi's Old Quarter (based on 248 photos and 78 data lines), the study argues that it is plausible to look at the aesthetics, architecture, and designs of the house façade to find traces of cultural evolution in Vietnam, which went through more than six decades of French colonization and centuries of sociocultural influence from China. The in-depth technical analysis, though refuting the presumed model on the probabilistic dependency among the variables, yields several results, the most notable of which is the strong influence of Buddhism over the decorations of the house façade. Particularly, in the top 5 networks with the best Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scores and small p-values, the variable for decorations (DC) always has a direct probabilistic dependency on the variable B for Buddhism. The paper then discusses these findings and suggests integrating Bayesian statistics in social sciences in general and for studies of cultural evolution and architectural transformation in particular. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Network; Buddhism; Cultural Evolution; Franco-chinese Style; French Colonialism; Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Hanoi Architecture; House Façade; Old Quarter","","","","","Ecole Superieure Des Beaux Arts De Lindochine, (2016); Blackmore, Susan J., Why we need memetics, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29, 4, pp. 349-350, (2006); Proceedings of the British Academy, (1996); Culture and the Evolutionary Process, (1985); Hanoi Painting, (2012); Bui Xuan Phai Cuoc Di Va Tac Pham, (1998); Encyclopedia of Buddhism, (2004); Cultural Transmission and Evolution A Quantitative Approach, (1981); Chiung, Wi Vun Taiffalo, Language, literacy, and nationalism: Taiwan's orthographic transition from the perspective of Han sphere, Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 28, 2, pp. 102-116, (2007); Kien Truc Dan Gian Truyen Thong Viet Nam Vietnam S Traditional Folk Architecture, (2003)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","25902911","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072597906"

Better understanding of their relationship is therefore important for river basin management. The present study conducted a detailed analysis of a long-term dataset consisting of a 58-year topographic survey and related data on human impact to clarify the long-term variation in the morphological characteristics of the lower Tedori River in Japan. An empirical model was established through the assessment of spatiotemporal variations in nonlinear rates of adjustment. The results indicated that sediment extraction and dam construction profoundly affected the morphological characteristics of the lower Tedori River and that the vertical adjustment of the river channel experienced five phases. Degradation occurred from 7 to 16 km upstream from the river mouth over all phases. Two aggradation phases following two degradation phases were observed from the river mouth to 2 km upstream. Aggradation and degradation phases appeared alternately from 2 to 7 km. The representative nonlinear rates of vertical adjustment in the second phase were the highest compared with those in the other phases in the entire reach. The correlation analysis revealed that the incision phase was mostly coupled with channel narrowing, while widening followed the deposition phase. It was deduced from aerial photo analysis and a comparison between slope and empirical critical slope that the pattern in the lower Tedori River was braided during the period 1950-2000. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dam Construction; Degradation; Sand And Gravel Mining; Tedori River; Antennas; Degradation; Mining Laws And Regulations; Water Management; Anthropogenic Disturbance; Correlation Analysis; Dam Construction; Morphological Changes; Morphological Characteristic; River Basin Management; Sand And Gravels; Spatio-temporal Variation; Rivers; Anthropogenic Effect; Dam Construction; Mining; River Basin; River Channel; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Tedori River","Antennas; Degradation; Mining laws and regulations; Water management; Anthropogenic disturbance; Correlation analysis; Dam construction; Morphological changes; Morphological characteristic; River basin management; Sand and gravels; Spatio-temporal variation; Rivers; anthropogenic effect; dam construction; mining; river basin; river channel; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Tedori River","","","The authors are grateful to the Hokuriku Regional Development Bureau, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism of Japan, for providing the field data.

Few studies have evaluated the association of serum β2-M with clinical outcome in hemodialysis patients using high-flux type. However, study on patients using low-flux dialyzer reuse has not been done yet. Patients and methods: Using serum β2-M level on predicting long-term mortality of hemodialysis patients was examined in 326 prevalent hemodialysis patients (45.59±14.46 years, hemodialysis duration of 47.5 (26–79) months, 186 males and 140 females). The patients were divided into 3 groups with equal number of patients, according to their serum β2-M levels: group A (n=109, serum β2-M concentration ≤55.7 mg/L), group B (n=109, serum β2-M level from 55.8 mg/L to 75.4 mg/L) and group C (n=108, serum β2-M concentration >75.4 mg/L). Results: During the follow-up period of 5 years, there were 75 all-cause deaths (23.0%). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that all-cause mortality in the higher β2-M group was significantly higher compared to that in the lower β2-M groups (p<0.001). Serum β2-M level was a significant predictor for all-cause mortality (AUC =0.898; p<0.001; Cut-off value: 74.9 mg/L, Se=93.3%, Sp=92.9%). Conclusion: Serum β2-M levels were a significant predictor of long-term mortality in hemodialysis patients, who use only low-flux dialyzers and reuse 6 times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Beta2-microglobulin; Hemodialysis; Mortality; Beta 2 Microglobulin; C Reactive Protein; Hemoglobin; Albumin; Beta 2 Microglobulin; C Reactive Protein; Hemoglobin; Adult; All Cause Mortality; Article; Disease Marker; Female; Hemodialysis; Hemodialysis Patient; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mortality Rate; Protein Blood Level; Treatment Duration","albumin; beta 2 microglobulin; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; adult; all cause mortality; Article; disease marker; female; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; protein blood level; treatment duration","","beta 2 microglobulin, 9066-69-7; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0","","Schardijn, G.

The prime objective of the current study is to investigate the relationship between supply chain integration, supply chain risk practices and supply chain performance Methodology: Integrating operations of supply chain with suppliers and customers, allow companies to streamline and improve data exchange and information that could result in the betterment of material and product flows within the SC. Results: We particularly explore how risk at country level in the form of rule of law influences the operational performance of SCI through its innovativeness and cost. Furthermore, we aim to explore how risk management practices of SC can be connected under different scenarios of risk and uncertainty. The current study has used SEM-PLS as a statistical tool to answer the research questions raised in this study and research objectives envisaged in the current study.

In order to reduce logistics cost. Currently, the pharmaceutical industry is focusing on outsourcing their logistics activities and centralizing their warehouse operation for various countries. Secondly, from wholesale supplies to 'end customer' deliveries. Especially in smaller sales markets, the pharmaceutical industry sends their products to wholesalers rather than directly to customers (hospitals, pharmacies, retailers), this strategy is fit for the low sales of the pharmaceutical industry. The prime objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between total quality management reserve supply chain and logistic performance of firms operating in the pharmaceutical industry in Indonesia. In addition to that, the indirect relationship between total quality management reserve supply chain and logistic performance, of firms operating in the pharmaceutical industry, is examined.

Vietnam has made huge strides in economic growth within three decades of reforms, lifting millions of people out of poverty thanks to better access to credit. At the same time, there are lending and borrowing practices that signal troubles ahead. Based on a thorough examination of the theoretical literature on indebtedness, the study sets out to identify the drivers of borrowing and over-borrowing in Vietnam in recent years. Particularly, the abundant financial and physical resources have given rise to consumerism and the boom of the super-rich. These are two of the four factors that have shifted Vietnamese culture from one that traditionally condemned debt as a vice to one that now tolerates indebtedness. The other two factors can be found at the corporate level where there is an over-reliance on debt financing and rampant rent-seeking. Here, a kind of 'resource curse' threatens sustainable corporate growth - businesses rely too much on borrowing to fuel their operations, but in fact are overlooking the innovation factor. The new politics of debt, we suggest, have created a toxically pro-consumption, debt-tolerant society. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumerism; Corporate Debt; Culture Of Indebtedness; Emerging Market; Household Debt; Vietnam","","","","","Lessons Unlearned, (2017); Understanding the Macro Financial Effects of Household Debt A Global Perspective, (2018); American Economic Review, (1963); Barbier, Edward B., Debt, Poverty and Resource Management in a Rural Smallholder Economy, Environmental and Resource Economics, 63, 2, pp. 411-427, (2016); Barslund, Mikkel, Formal and informal rural credit in four provinces of Vietnam, Journal of Development Studies, 44, 4, pp. 485-503, (2008); Beeson, Mark, Developmentalism with Vietnamese Characteristics: The Persistence of State-led Development in East Asia, Journal of Contemporary Asia, 42, 4, pp. 539-559, (2012); Growing Up Fast Vietnam Discovers the Consumer Society; Real Estate Lending Risks Vietnam Investment Review, (2018); Growth and Vulnerabilities in Microfinance, (2010); What Drives Household Borrowing and Credit Constraints Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina, (2008)","","SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies","","","","","","1999253X; 19992521","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069806990"

In this study, water deficits in 2- and 3-day intervals were imposed on two Japonica cultivars K1 and K3, and an Indica K4 subtype after anthesis to harvest. It was observed that although rice yield was affected, the protein content was increased 6.53-6.63% to 9.93-10.16%. The amylose quantity was reduced significantly from 22.00-22.43% to 16.33-17.56%, while fatty acids in rice grain were not influenced. Total anthocyanins were greatly promoted by 53.1% as compared to the non-treated trials. The antioxidant capacity in rice grain increased up to 59.1% in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and 41.6% in reducing power assays. Findings of this research revealed that the 3-day interval of water deficit imposition was the most effective to improve rice macronutrients and quality, as well as beneficial phytochemicals and antioxidants in rice grain.

Improving the investment climate may foster the development of the private sector by creating sustainable jobs and opportunities for entrepreneurs, which contributes to sustained poverty reduction in developing countries. This research examined the relationship between the investment climate and firm productivity by exploring a unique panel dataset of 1310 enterprises operating in the manufacturing sector in Vietnam. Productivity was measured as the total factor productivity (TFP) obtained by production function estimation using Levinsohn and Petrin's approach. Investment climate factors included infrastructure, labor skills, regulatory governance and institutions, and access to finance. It was shown that restrictions on the investment climate were harmful to firm productivity. The lack of Internet and financial accessibility, low educational level of employees, administrative burden and the cost of bribery were negatively associated with firm TFP.

Suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence has been linked to subsequent missed visits. Knowing the determinants of missed visits in Asian patients will allow for appropriate counselling and intervention strategies to ensure continuous engagement in care. A missed visit was defined as having no assessments within six months. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to analyse factors associated with missed visits. A total of 7100 patients were included from 12 countries in Asia with 2676 (37.7%) having at least one missed visit. Patients with early suboptimal self-reported adherence <95% were more likely to have a missed visit compared to those with adherence ≥95% (OR = 2.55, 95% CI(1.81–3.61)). Other factors associated with having a missed visit were homosexual (OR = 1.45, 95%CI(1.27–1.66)) and other modes of HIV exposure (OR = 1.48, 95%CI(1.27–1.74)) compared to heterosexual exposure; using PI-based (OR = 1.33, 95%CI(1.15–1.53) and other ART combinations (OR = 1.79, 95%CI(1.39–2.32)) compared to NRTI+NNRTI combinations; and being hepatitis C co-infected (OR = 1.27, 95%CI(1.06–1.52)).

Almost 40% of our patients had a missed clinic visit. Early ART adherence was an indicator of subsequent clinic visits. Intensive counselling and adherence support should be provided at ART initiation in order to optimise long-term clinic attendance and maximise treatment outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adherence; Asia; Hiv; Missed Visit; Anti-hiv Agents; Anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus Agent; Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor; Rna Directed Dna Polymerase Inhibitor; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Antiretroviral Therapy; Article; Cambodia; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; China; Female; Follow Up; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Heterosexuality; High Income Country; Homosexuality; Hong Kong; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; India; Indonesia; Japan; Long Term Care; Major Clinical Study; Malaysia; Male; Middle Income Country; Mixed Infection; Patient Attitude; Patient Compliance; Philippines; Priority Journal; Singapore; South Korea; Taiwan; Thailand; Treatment Outcome; Treatment Response; Viet Nam; Asia; Income; Medication Compliance; Middle Aged; Organization And Management; Outpatient Department; Secondary Prevention; Self Report; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Anti-hiv Agents; Female; Hiv Infections; Humans; Income; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Secondary Prevention; Self Report","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; adult; ambulatory care; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Cambodia; CD4 lymphocyte count; China; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; heterosexuality; high income country; homosexuality; Hong Kong; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; India; Indonesia; Japan; long term care; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle income country; mixed infection; patient attitude; patient compliance; Philippines; priority journal; Singapore; South Korea; Taiwan; Thailand; treatment outcome; treatment response; Viet Nam; Asia; income; medication compliance; middle aged; organization and management; outpatient department; secondary prevention; self report; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Anti-HIV Agents; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Income; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Secondary Prevention; Self Report","","Anti-HIV Agents","The TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database is an initiative of TREAT Asia, a program of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, with support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as part of the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA; U01AI069907).

This interdisciplinary study contributes to the literature through its application of Bayesian statistics in analyzing Vietnamese folklore. By breaking down 307 stories in popular Vietnamese folktales and major story collections and categorizing their core messages under the values or anti-values of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, the study shows how the Bayesian method helps discover an underlying behavioural phenomenon called “cultural additivity.” The term, which is inspired by the principle of additivity in probability, adds to the voluminous works on syncretism, creolization and hybridity in its technical dimension. Here, to evaluate how the values and norms of the aforementioned three religions (“tam giáo” 三教) co-exist, interact, and influence Vietnamese society, the study proposes three models of additivity for religious faiths: (a) no additivity, (b) simple additivity, and (c) complex additivity. The empirical results confirm the existence of “cultural additivity” : not only is there an isolation of Buddhism in the folktales, there is also a higher possibility of interaction or addition of Confucian and Taoist values even when these two religions hold different value systems (β <inf>{VT.VC}</inf> = 0.86). The arbitrary blend of the three religions is an example of the observed phenomenon of Vietnamese people selecting and adding ideas, beliefs, or artefacts—which may sometimes appear contradictory to principles of their existing beliefs—to their culture. The behavioural pattern is omnipresent in the sense that it can also be seen in Vietnamese arts, architecture, or adoption of new ideas and religions, among others. The “cultural additivity” concept, backed by robust statistical analysis, is an attempt to fill in the cultural core pointed out by syncretism and account for the rising complexity of modern societies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank research staff at Vuong & Associates for assistance in collecting and preparing dataset, particularly Dam Thu Ha and Nghiem Phu Kien Cuong.

This study uses data on propensity of general health exam (GHE) spending to show that despite the debate on the necessity of GHE, its objective is clear—to obtain more information and certainty about one’s health so as to minimise future risks. Most studies on this topic, however, focus only on factors associated with GHE uptake and overlook the shifts in behaviours and attitudes regarding different levels of cost. To fill the gap, this study analyses a dataset of 2068 subjects collected from Hanoi (Vietnam) and its vicinities using the baseline-category logit method. We evaluate the sensitivity of Vietnamese healthcare consumers against two groups of factors (demographic and socioeconomic-cognitive) regarding payment for periodic GHE, which is not covered by insurance. Our study shows that uninsured, married and employed individuals are less sensitive to cost than their counterparts because they value the information in reducing future health uncertainty. The empirical results challenge the objections to periodic health screening by highlighting its utility. The relevance of behavioural economics is further highlighted through a look at the bounded rationality of healthcare consumers and private insurance companies in using and providing the service, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Agborsangaya, Calypse B., Multimorbidity prevalence and patterns across socioeconomic determinants: a cross-sectional survey., BMC Public Health, 12, (2012); Agee, Mark D., Lessons from game theory about healthcare system price inflation: Evidence from a community-level case study, Applied Health Economics and Health Policy, 11, 1, pp. 45-51, (2013); Categorical Data Analysis, (2002); Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data, (1984); Becker, Marshall H., The Health Belief Model and Sick Role Behavior, Health Education and Behavior, 2, 4, pp. 409-419, (1977); Boulware, L.

Solid wastes from 120 hotels were sampled, the face-to-face interviews were conducted, and statistical methods were carried out to analyze the data. The results showed that the mean of waste generation rate of the hotels was 2.28 kg/guest/day and strongly correlated to internal influencing factors such as the capacity, the price of the room, garden, and level of restaurant. The differences in waste generation rate of the hotels were proved to be statistically significant. The higher the scale of hotels, the higher the waste generation rate. Moreover, the waste composition of the hotels was identified by 58.5% for biodegradable waste, 25.8% for recyclables and 15.7% for others. The relative differences in the waste composition of the hotels by climate, the features of hotels, and the types of the guest were explained. Whereby, the higher size of the hotels, the higher percentage of biodegradable and less proportion of recyclable waste. Also, this study revealed that the implementation status of waste management practices of the hoteliers initially reaped quite positive achievements with 76% for sorting, 39% for recycling, 29% for reduction, and 0.8% for composting. The rate of waste management practices was proportional to the scale of the hotel.

Applying the baseline-category logit model, the study analyzed two groups of factors associated with EAS regularity: (i) physiological factors (sex, body mass index (BMI)) and (ii) external factors (education, health communication, medical practice at home). Females with a university education or higher usually exercise less than those with lower education, while the opposite is true for males. The study also shows that those with a higher BMI tend to report higher activity levels. Additionally, improved health communication systems and regular health check-ups at home are also associated with more frequent EAS activities. These results, albeit limited to only one location in Vietnam, provide a basis for making targeted policies that promote a more active lifestyle. This, in turn, could help the country realize the goal of improving the average height of the population and reducing the incidents of non-communicable diseases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Educational Background; Health Communication; Physical Exercises And Sports; Sex; Social Public Health; Baseline Survey; Body Mass; Capital City; Communication; Health Policy; Health Survey; Lifestyle; Obesity; Physical Activity; Physiology; Public Health; Regulatory Framework; Sex Role; Hanoi; Viet Nam","baseline survey; body mass; capital city; communication; health policy; health survey; lifestyle; obesity; physical activity; physiology; public health; regulatory framework; sex role; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","","van Bui, Tan, Physical activity in Vietnam: Estimates and measurement issues, PLOS ONE, 10, 10, (2015); Althoff, Tim, Large-scale physical activity data reveal worldwide activity inequality, Nature, 547, 7663, pp. 336-339, (2017); Vietnamese People Among the Most Sedentary in the World Survey, (2018); Nguyen, Tuan Thanh, Body mass index (BMI) dynamics in vietnam, European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 62, 1, pp. 78-86, (2008); Cuong, T.

Based on the survey data from 336 public officials who hired based on the TM program, we have found that perceived hard HM practices are negatively related with turnover intention while there is no relation between soft HM practice and intention to leave the organization. Employee engagement (EE) fully mediates the relationship between perceived hard TM practices and turnover intention, and partially mediates the relationship between perceived person-environment (PE) fit and turnover intention.

To mitigate these negative effects, it is necessary to restrategize and identify viable options that are environmentally and economically applicable for sustainable agriculture. This review summarizes and evaluates soil reclamation strategies that have been employed and those that could potentially be used, concentrating on the use of legume crops. Apart from the fact that legumes have many nutritional benefits as foods, they are also an attractive option to refertilize degraded and nitrogen-deficient soils. Thus, the potential use of grain, grass, shrubby, and tree legumes to restore degraded soils requires evaluation. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate why legumes should be considered and used for the reclamation of degraded soils, with a particular focus on salt-degraded soils. Globally relevant case-studies that demonstrate how legumes could be used to reclaim salt-degraded soils are highlighted. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Sustainability; Increasing Soil Salinity; Legumes; Nutrient; Reclamation; Salt-degraded Soil; Crops; Land Reclamation; Nutrients; Reclamation; Seed; Sustainable Development; Agricultural Sustainability; Degraded Soils; Environmental Problems; Legumes; Nutritional Benefits; Salt Stress Tolerance; Soil Salinity; Sustainable Agriculture; Soils; Alternative Agriculture; Legume; Nutrient; Saline Soil; Salinity Tolerance; Sustainability","Crops; Land reclamation; Nutrients; Reclamation; Seed; Sustainable development; Agricultural sustainability; Degraded soils; Environmental problems; legumes; Nutritional benefits; Salt stress tolerance; Soil salinity; Sustainable agriculture; Soils; alternative agriculture; legume; nutrient; saline soil; salinity tolerance; sustainability","","","Lam-Son Phan Tran appreciates the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for the Grant 17K07459.","Abdel-Fattah, M.

Therefore, this study proposes an integrated approach, combining 1D simulation, GIS based land use analysis, intensive household survey and Contingent Value Method to estimate Flood Risk Curve and Average Annual Risk (in monetary value) for rural agricultural production. The selected study area is located in the floodplain of Vu Gia-Thu Bon (VG-TB) basin, one of the largest and most complex basins in Vietnam with dense population. The key finding shows that although the local agricultural practice is well adapted to the flooding season to reduce direct damage, the calculated Annual Average Risk is still as high as 6% of total agricultural production every year, of which indirect and intangible risk accounts for 62%. Therefore, this result is believed to produce complete understanding about the total risk that need to be coped with. The managers, local communities and other stakeholders can also use Annual Average Risk as a clear, strong and quantitative indicator for a certain area showing how vulnerable it is to flood risk and which measures would be effective and worth to be invested from cost-effective point of view. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Average Annual Risk; Flood Risk Curve; Intangible Damage; Rural Floodplain; Vu Gia-thu Bon Basin","","","","This research is part of study funded by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

Results from the land cover classification of five Landsat images between 1973 and 2014 indicated that the forest area decreased significantly in the period of 1994 to 2005 due to population growth, leading to land conversion for agriculture. Furthermore, secular changes in the annual GIMMS-NDVI data revealed that land cover changes occurred from 1996 and a large amount of forest was lost in 1999; however, due to the rapid regrowth of secondary forest of tropical forests and the development of the crop, the vegetation recovered shortly afterwards in 2000 before decreasing again after 2004. Following large-scale deforestation, the total discharge, maximum flow, and the plentiful, ordinary, low, and small-scale runoff increased sharply and decreased thereafter because of vegetation regrowth. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dong Nai River Basin; Flow Regime; Flow-duration Curve; Land Use And Land Cover Change; Deforestation; Economics; Population Statistics; Regional Planning; Rivers; Runoff; Tropics; Vegetation; Watersheds; Flow Duration Curve; Flow Regimes; Land Cover Classification; Land Use And Land Cover Change; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; River Basins; Sustainable Regional Development; Temporal And Spatial Scale; Land Use; Deforestation; Economic Development; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Landsat; Ndvi; Population Growth; Regrowth; Runoff; Satellite Data; Satellite Imagery; Secondary Forest; Tropical Forest; Water Resource; Dong Nai Basin; Viet Nam","Deforestation; Economics; Population statistics; Regional planning; Rivers; Runoff; Tropics; Vegetation; Watersheds; Flow duration curve; Flow regimes; Land cover classification; Land use and land cover change; Normalized difference vegetation index; River basins; Sustainable regional development; Temporal and spatial scale; Land use; deforestation; economic development; land cover; land use change; Landsat; NDVI; population growth; regrowth; runoff; satellite data; satellite imagery; secondary forest; tropical forest; water resource; Dong Nai Basin; Viet Nam","","","","Bewket, Woldeamlak, Dynamics in land cover and its effect on stream flow in the Chemoga watershed, Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia, Hydrological Processes, 19, 2, pp. 445-458, (2005); Costa, Marcos Heil, Effects of large-scale changes in land cover on the discharge of the Tocantins River, Southeastern Amazonia, Journal of Hydrology, 283, 1-4, pp. 206-217, (2003); Kashaigili, Japhet J., Impacts of land-use and land-cover changes on flow regimes of the Usangu wetland and the Great Ruaha River, Tanzania, Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, 33, 8-13, pp. 640-647, (2008); J Agric Sci Appl, (2013); Khoi, Dao Nguyen, Impact of climate and land-use changes on hydrological processes and sediment yield-a case study of the Be River catchment, Vietnam, Hydrological Sciences Journal, 59, 5, pp. 1095-1108, (2014); Liang, Dongli, Impacts of land use change and climate variability on hydrology in an agricultural catchment on the Loess Plateau of China, Journal of Hydrology, 377, 1-2, pp. 35-42, (2009); Nie, Wenming, Assessing impacts of Landuse and Landcover changes on hydrology for the upper San Pedro watershed, Journal of Hydrology, 407, 1-4, pp. 105-114, (2011); Tan, Mou Leong, Impacts of land-use and climate variability on hydrological components in the Johor River basin, Malaysia, Hydrological Sciences Journal, 60, 5, pp. 873-889, (2015); Bosch, J.

Moreover, water productivity or water use efficiency in rice production was quite low in the region due to free-rider problem. Therefore, the study was aimed at measuring water use efficiency at farm level and investigating the factors affecting water use efficiency. The study applied stochastic frontier analysis to estimate water use efficiency for 159 rice farmers in the upstream of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The study shows that the average water use efficiency was 18.81%, indicating that rice farmers did consume water very inefficiently. On the average, the rice farmers could reduce their water consumption about 81.19%, keeping their output level and other inputs constant. To improve water use efficiency, the study found that land accumulation or large-scaled production is essential. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Tobit Regression; Water Use Efficiency; Agriculture; Efficiency; Stochastic Systems; Water Supply; Climate Change Adaptation; Dam Construction; Mekong Delta; Rice Farmers; Rice Production; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Tobit Regression; Vietnamese; Water Scarcity; Water Use Efficiency; Climate Change","Agriculture; Efficiency; Stochastic systems; Water supply; Climate change adaptation; Dam construction; Mekong Delta; Rice farmers; Rice production; Stochastic frontier analysis; Tobit regression; Vietnamese; Water scarcity; Water use efficiency; Climate change","","","This research (ID number R11616) was funded by RONPAKU, JSPS.

The developed models were evaluated based on the experimental data of six batch reactors. Anaerobic digestion test was co-digestion of food and vegetable waste with inoculating horse dung by 15% of the total wet weight, at the temperature of 37°C. For hydrolysis, the modified model was developed from an original first-order kinetic model. The modified first-order kinetic model was proved to be better than the original one with the hydrolysis rate constant in the range of 0.22- 0.34/day and hydrolyzable rate of 0.80 to 0.84. Kinetics of carbon dioxide and methane were developed from a current potential model. The comparison between experimental data and modeling values had the high correlation of determination (0.9918-0.9998) and low root mean square errors (0.08-4.51) indicating the feasibility of the developed model. In which, the evolution of methane showed the rate constant in the range of 0.031-0.039/day. The carbon dioxide from fermentation accounted for 12-44% of the total observed carbon dioxide. Thus, separation of fermentation and methanogenesis by various reactors may reduce the price of methane enrichment significantly. There was a lag time between methanogenesis and fermentation in reactors (λ = 7-11 days). Also, the biogas yield was in the range of 431.6-596.9 Nml/g-VS with the CH<inf>4</inf> concentration of 56.2-67.5%. The best methane yield (393.7 Nml/g-VS) was in a reactor with food waste to the vegetable waste ratio by 1.8:1 (wet basis) and C/N ratio by 25.4. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic Digestion (ad); Carbon Dioxide (co2); First-order Kinetic (fok); Food Waste (fw); Methane (ch4); Modified First-order Kinetic (mfk); Vegetable Waste (vw)","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University in Japan for their financial support.","Abbassi-Guendouz, Amel, Total solids content drives high solid anaerobic digestion via mass transfer limitation, Bioresource Technology, 111, pp. 55-61, (2012); Boulanger, Anthony, Effect of inoculum to substrate ratio (I/S) on municipal solid waste anaerobic degradation kinetics and potential, Waste Management, 32, 12, pp. 2258-2265, (2012); Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (1992); Chen, Shujun, Effects of alkalinity sources on the stability of anaerobic digestion from food waste, Waste Management and Research, 33, 11, pp. 1033-1040, (2015); J Renew Sustain Energy, (2015); Pham van, Dinh, A new kinetic model for biogas production from co-digestion by batch mode, Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management, 4, 3, pp. 251-262, (2018); 4th International Conference on Environment and Renewable Energy Da Nang, (2018); Gerardi, Michael H., The Microbiology of Anaerobic Digesters, pp. 1-177, (2003); Goswami, Ramansu, An overview of physico-chemical mechanisms of biogas production by microbial communities: A step towards sustainable waste management, 3 Biotech, 6, 1, (2016); Itodo, Isaac Nathaniel, Effects of total solids concentrations of poultry, cattle, and piggery waste slurries on biogas yield, Transactions - American Society of Agricultural Engineers: General Edition, 42, 6, pp. 1853-1855, (1999)","","Iran Solid Waste Association","","","","","","23833572; 23833866","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055146211"

This study investigated the nutrient composition of so-called organic fertilizers in Vietnam's markets and issues related to their production, and evaluated their potential to contaminate the groundwater. We analyzed the physicochemical properties of 12 domestic and four imported products of the fertilizers, and conducted a cultivation experiment in sandy soil with the fertilizer applied at a rate of 200 mg N kg-1 soil using an automatic watering apparatus in a greenhouse. We further studied the production of an ""organic fertilizer"" from coffee by-products. The nutrient content greatly varied among domestic products, whereas they were quite similar among imported products. The product packaging of the collected samples lacked information regarding raw materials. Two thirds of the domestic products contained over 30% of the total N in the inorganic form, implying that the N content dramatically increased in the fertilizers rather than in their supposed raw materials. The stages involved in the production were composting, the addition of extra soil as a bulking agent, and the mixing-in of chemical substances to increase the nutrient content before packing. The remarkably high ratio of inorganic N to total N was attributed to excessive N leaching from soil by the application of domestic fertilizers. These results suggested the need for quality criteria guidelines for organic fertilizers in Vietnam that underline not only nutrient levels, but also the control of raw materials and production process of compost, because they are closely related to nutrient uptake and the leaching loss of nutrients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coffee By-products; N Leaching; Nutrient Composition; Production; So-called Organic Fertilizer; Byproduct; Chemical Substance; Crop Production; Developing World; Fertilizer; Groundwater Pollution; Leaching; Market Conditions; Nutrient Loss; Nutrient Uptake; Physicochemical Property; Sandy Soil; Viet Nam","byproduct; chemical substance; crop production; developing world; fertilizer; groundwater pollution; leaching; market conditions; nutrient loss; nutrient uptake; physicochemical property; sandy soil; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This research was funded by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and the Research Grant for Encouragement of Students, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Japan.","Parvathi, Priyanka, Fair Trade and Organic Agriculture in Developing Countries: A Review, Journal of International Food and Agribusiness Marketing, 25, 4, pp. 311-323, (2013); Rehber, Erkan, Prospects and challenges for developing countries in trade and production of organic food and fibers: The case of Turkey, British Food Journal, 104, pp. 371-390, (2002); Proceedings of the 4th Ansoftworkshop Gwangju, (2012); Production and Supply Chain Management of Organic Food in Vietnam; undefined; Proceedings of the Asian Soil Partnership Consultationworkshop on Sustainable Management and Protection of Soil Resources Bangkok Thailand 13 15 May 2015; Proceedings of the Japan Vietnam Research Workshop on Sustainable Society Development in Asian Countries Talking Climate Change, (2015); Vu, Quyet Manh, Socio-economic and biophysical determinants of land degradation in Vietnam: An integrated causal analysis at the national level, Land Use Policy, 36, pp. 605-617, (2014); Nguyen, Trung Thanh, Does land tenure security promote manure use by farm households in Vietnam?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 8, 2, (2016); Ho, Thong Quoc, Eco-efficiency analysis of sustainability-certified coffee production in Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 183, pp. 251-260, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049897991"

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the collected data from the survey, the Money Laundering Risk Score (MLRS) is calculated for each customer who is using the services and products of Vietnamese commercial banks by the enhanced measurement model of Christopher Price, the ordinary least squares and three variations of logistic regression model. Findings: This paper proposes an appropriate estimation of the money laundering risk (MLR) for personal customer using the most significant factors that affects MLR and suggests practical recommendations for commercial banking system. Practical implications: This paper suggests an intuitive method to estimate the contribution of each customer factor on their MLRS. Originality/value: The higher respondent’s group of age lead to the higher MLR occurred in the financial market. Follow the works of Wolfsberg et al.

However, this scheme leads to two serious problems: data concentration around the hole boundaries and routing path enlargement. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to address these two problems, wherein a common idea is to form forbidden areas around the holes from which packets are kept to stay away. Unfortunately, most of the protocols proposed so far address only special cases where either the network contains only one hole or the sources and the destinations stay fairly far from the holes. In this paper, we focus on the general case where the network may contain multiple holes and the sources/destinations may stay in the vicinity of the holes. We then propose a hole bypassing protocol which can balance the traffic over the network while ensuring the constant stretch property of the routing path. The theoretical analysis proves that the routing path stretch of the proposed protocol can be controlled to be as small as 1+\epsilon (for any predefined \epsilon\gt0), and the simulation experiments show that our protocol strongly outperforms state-of-the-art protocols in terms of load balancing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disaster Prevention; Hole Concentration; Internet Protocols; Network Routing; Wireless Sensor Networks; Data Concentration; Disaster Management; External Force; Forward Packets; Multiple Holes; Problem Datum; Routing Holes; Routing Path; Routings; Sensor Network Routing; Disasters","Disaster prevention; Hole concentration; Internet protocols; Network routing; Wireless sensor networks; Data concentration; Disaster management; External force; Forward packets; Multiple holes; Problem datum; Routing holes; Routing path; Routings; Sensor network routing; Disasters","","","This work is supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16H02817.","Chen, Dan, Natural disaster monitoring with wireless sensor networks: A case study of data-intensive applications upon low-cost scalable systems, Mobile Networks and Applications, 18, 5, pp. 651-663, (2013); Erdelj, Milan, Wireless Sensor Networks and Multi-UAV systems for natural disaster management, Computer Networks, 124, pp. 72-86, (2017); IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, (2017); Bhosle, Anand S., Forest disaster management with wireless sensor network, pp. 287-289, (2016); Karp, Brad, GPSR: Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing for wireless networks, Proceedings of the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MOBICOM, pp. 243-254, (2000); Trajcevski, Goce, Bypassing holes in sensor networks: Load-balance vs. latency, (2011); Chang, Guey Yun, A hole avoiding routing protocol in wireless sensor networks, pp. 75-79, (2014); Won, Myounggyu, GOAL: A parsimonious geographic routing protocol for large scale sensor networks, Ad Hoc Networks, 11, 1, pp. 453-472, (2013); Nguyen, Phile, Load balanced routing with constant stretch for wireless sensor network with holes, (2014); Won, Myounggyu, A low-stretch-guaranteed and lightweight geographic routing protocol for large-scale wireless sensor networks, ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks, 11, 1, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Disaster Management, ICT-DM 2018","","Sendai","144955","","9781538666388","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062840373"

To deal with the limitation of the conventional approach, this study argues for an important change from the relevance approach to the sufficiency approach represented by a novel construct of perceived information sufficiency. Using attitude theory, this study examines non-attendance attributes through perceived information sufficiency. Theoretical and empirical test results demonstrate that perceived information sufficiency influences the accuracy of respondents’ choices. In particular, a higher level of perceived sufficiency of information given to travelers will result in less involvement of bounded rationality, leading to a more accurate attribute-based prediction of conventional stated choice surveys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitude Theory; Attribute Non-attendance; Stated Choice Surveys","","","","","Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alemu, Mohammed Hussen, Attending to the Reasons for Attribute Non-attendance in Choice Experiments, Environmental and Resource Economics, 54, 3, pp. 333-359, (2013); Bagozzi, Richard P., Specification, evaluation, and interpretation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 40, 1, pp. 8-34, (2012); Campbell, Danny, Non-attendance to attributes in environmental choice analysis: A latent class specification, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 54, 8, pp. 1061-1076, (2011); Cascetta, Ennio, A new look at planning and designing transportation systems: A decision-making model based on cognitive rationality, stakeholder engagement and quantitative methods, Transport Policy, 38, pp. 27-39, (2015); Mode Choice of Complex Tours Association for European Transport, (2002); Coast, Joanna, Developing attributes and levels for discrete choice experiments using qualitative methods, Journal of Health Services Research and Policy, 12, 1, pp. 25-30, (2007); Collins, Andrew T., Specification issues in a generalised random parameters attribute nonattendance model, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 234-253, (2013); Colombo, Sergio, Social preferences for agricultural policy instruments: joint consideration of non-attendance to attributes and to alternatives in modelling discrete choice data, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 57, 2, pp. 215-232, (2014); Erdem, Seda, Accounting for attribute-level non-attendance in a health choice experiment: Does it matter?, Health Economics (United Kingdom), 24, 7, pp. 773-789, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","2214367X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025669562"

Instead, they continue to use shared spaces with pedestrians or motor vehicles. Thus, simply adding a bike facility does not guarantee that cyclists will switch to using it. Owing to the considerable development of bike facilities, the investigation of facility preference, particularly focusing on facility choice forecast, has become increasingly important. This study developed a model for predicting the facility choice of cyclists between on-street facilities (curb, traffic lane, and bike lane (BL)) and off-street facilities (sidewalks). Initially, the optimal model was selected using Bayesian Model Averaging method. Then, it was validated by both internal and external validations. Apart from the aforementioned factors, several other exogenous variables were also found to be significant predictors of bike facility choice, including the width of traffic lanes, existence of real-time stopping vehicle, type of bike, bus stop existence, and in-group cycling. Analysis of the relative importance of predictors indicated that bus stop existence, effective sidewalk width, and type of bike were the potential predictors. A framework for predicting BL usage, if it is present, was also developed. A test for the predictive performance of the application at a real site was carried out. By comparing predicted and actual BL usage figures, the analysis showed good predictive performance. The results of this study can help developers, planners, and designers to adopt reasonable investment decisions as well as better designs in developing new bike facilities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bicycle Facility; Bicycle Facility Choice; Bicycle Facility Preference; Bicycle Lane; Bicycle Lane Usage; Bayesian Networks; Bus Terminals; Forecasting; Investments; Pavements; Bayesian Model Averaging; Bicycle Lanes; Exogenous Variables; Investment Decisions; Its Applications; Optimal Model; Predictive Performance; Traffic Lanes; Bicycles","Bayesian networks; Bus terminals; Forecasting; Investments; Pavements; Bayesian model averaging; Bicycle lanes; Exogenous variables; Investment decisions; ITS applications; Optimal model; Predictive performance; Traffic lanes; Bicycles","","","","Emond, Catherine R., Explaining gender difference in bicycling behavior, Transportation Research Record, 2125, pp. 16-25, (2009); Landis, Bruce W., Real-time human perceptions: Toward a bicycle level of service, Transportation Research Record, 1578, pp. 119-131, (1997); Transportation Research Board 88th Annual Meeting, (2009); Lee, Chanam, Neighbourhood design and physical activity, Building Research and Information, 36, 5, pp. 395-411, (2008); Fell Street Bike Lane Scott to Baker and Tow Away Zone Proposal, (2004); Taylor, Dean B., Analysis of stated preferences for intermodal bicycle-transit interfaces, Transportation Research Record, 1556, pp. 86-95, (1996); Sener, Ipek Nese, An analysis of bicycle route choice preferences in Texas, US, Transportation, 36, 5, pp. 511-539, (2009); Tilahun, Nebiyou Y., Trails, lanes, or traffic: Valuing bicycle facilities with an adaptive stated preference survey, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 41, 4, pp. 287-301, (2007); Traffic Safety on Two Continents Conference, (2000); Dill, Jennifer, Bicycle Commuting and Facilities in Major U.S. Cities: If You Build Them, Commuters Will Use Them, Transportation Research Record, 1828, pp. 116-123, (2003)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03861112","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022047869"

Firstly, we propose a modification of BiLSTM-CRF model that allows the use of external features to improve the performance of deep learning models in case large annotated corpora are not available. However, this model can only recognize RE parts which are not overlapped. Secondly, we propose two approaches for recognizing overlapping RE parts including the cascading approach which uses the sequence of BiLSTM-CRF models and the unified model approach with the multilayer BiLSTM-CRF model and the multilayer BiLSTM-MLP-CRF model. Experimental results on two Japan law RRE datasets demonstrated advantages of our proposed models. For the Japanese National Pension Law dataset, our approaches obtained an F<inf>1</inf> score of 93.27% and exhibited a significant improvement compared to previous approaches. For the Japan Civil Code RRE dataset which is written in English, our approaches produced an F<inf>1</inf> score of 78.24% in recognizing RE parts that exhibited a significant improvement over strong baselines.

The study aimed to examine the factor structure and to explore the cross-cultural utility of the MHC-SF using bifactor models and exploratory structural equation modelling. Method: Using multigroup confirmatory analysis (MGCFA) we examined the measurement invariance of the MHC-SF in 38 countries (university students, N = 8,066; 61.73% women, mean age 21.55 years). Results: MGCFA supported the cross-cultural replicability of a bifactor structure and a metric level of invariance between student samples. The average proportion of variance explained by the general factor was high (ECV =.66), suggesting that the three aspects of mental health (emotional, social, and psychological well-being) can be treated as a single dimension of well-being. Conclusion: The metric level of invariance offers the possibility of comparing correlates and predictors of positive mental functioning across countries; however, the comparison of the levels of mental health across countries is not possible due to lack of scalar invariance. Our study has preliminary character and could serve as an initial assessment of the structure of the MHC-SF across different cultural settings.

Such an approach overlooks several important inter-relationships among the largely different integrated components of cultural ES, i.e. recreational, spiritual, education concerns, etc. In this paper, the need of more explicit typologies is underscored via a case study, where the authors represented the discrepancies between two tiers of Cultural ES: those associated with Spiritual Values and Recreational Opportunities using a socio-georaphically-based tri-indicator analytical framework. More specifically, two survey-based (Richness and Quality of ES), and one GIS-based (Willingness to Travel (WTT)) indices were proposed to evaluate a full range of cultural benefits derived from seven popular tourism sites of Ha Tien Town, Kien Giang, Vietnam. These numerical indicators pointed out the significant differences between ritual values and recreational based benefits, underlining the crucial need of fuller taxonomies of cultural services within the ES analytical framework. With respect to the study area, the measurements of Quality and Richness detected major synergies and tradeoffs among the evaluated benefits, supporting the need to balance management between developing tourism activities and preserving cultural identity of the landscapes. The last indicator, WTT utilizes map data from OpenStreetMap to produce an objective metric in evaluating landscape quality, taking into account the frequency and the potential costs in traveling to respective sites. This indicator constitutes a reliable and equitable method to represent relevant Cultural ES of landscapes besides the popular yet controversial money-based indices, e.g. Willingness to Pay or Willingness to Accept. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultural Ecosystem Services; Openstreetmap; Socio-geographic Indicators; Spatial Analyst; Willingness To Travel","","","","Funding text 1: Map data for WTT of this research copyrighted OpenStreetMap contributors and are available from http://www.openstreetmap.org .

Exploration of the changes will help develop appropriate management and adaptation strategies. This study presents an assessment of changes in rainfall and runoffin the upper Thu Bon River basin in central Vietnam in the near-term (2026-2035) climate using direct Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) high-resolution model outputs. A nearly calibration-free parameter rainfall-runoffmodel was employed to explore the runoffresponse in the study basin. Most model simulations have detected greater decreases in the near-term runoffin the dry season compared with those of any preceding decades in the baseline (1979-2008) climate, though the rainfall in this period is expected to increase slightly. Meanwhile, monsoonal season flooding has the potential to become more severe, and Japanese models project further increase in the intensity of such extreme weather events.

The phytoremediation of saline-sodic soils has not been well documented in the Songnen Plain of northeast China. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of grass (G) and maize (Zea mays L.; M) vegetation systems, which were established for 5 years, on soil properties of 10 typical saline-sodic sampling sites across the Songnen Plain, in comparison with respective nonvegetated areas that were used as controls (CK) for the evaluation of variability among the sampling sites. Physicochemical properties, such as soil moisture, bulk density, porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, aggregate stability, pH, electric conductivity, total salt, organic C, total N, and C/N ratio, were analyzed. G and M vegetation significantly produced a 108% and 153% improvement in soil quality, respectively. Additionally, metagenomic analysis of the soil bacterial community revealed that vegetation enhanced the ability of the bacteria to survive in saline-sodic soils, relative to the control. The composition of the bacterial community was highly correlated with all of the soil physicochemical properties. G vegetation had better effects than M vegetation in enhancing soil organic C, total N and aggregate stability, whereas M vegetation more favorably adjusted soil pH, physical structure, and bacterial community than G vegetation did. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that M vegetation has a greater impact than G vegetation on repairing saline-sodic soils in the Songnen Plain of northeast China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aggregate Stability; Bacterial Community Structure; Grass And Maize For Remediation; Phytoremediation; Saline-sodic Soils; Songnen Plain; Aggregates; Bacteria; Bioremediation; Grain (agricultural Product); Hydraulic Conductivity; Soil Moisture; Aggregate Stability; Bacterial Community Structure; Phytoremediation; Saline-sodic Soils; Songnen Plain; Vegetation; Aggregate Stability; Bacterium; Community Composition; Grass; Maize; Microbial Community; Physicochemical Property; Phytoremediation; Saline Soil; Sodic Soil; China; Songnen Plain; Bacteria (microorganisms); Zea Mays","Aggregates; Bacteria; Bioremediation; Grain (agricultural product); Hydraulic conductivity; Soil moisture; Aggregate stability; Bacterial community structure; Phytoremediation; Saline-sodic soils; Songnen plain; Vegetation; aggregate stability; bacterium; community composition; grass; maize; microbial community; physicochemical property; phytoremediation; saline soil; sodic soil; China; Songnen Plain; Bacteria (microorganisms); Zea mays","","","Funding text 1: 135 Project of Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Grant/Award Number: Y6H2043001; Key Laboratory Foundation of Mollisols Agroecology, Grant/Award Number: 2016ZKHT‐05; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 31370144, 41571255 and 41701332; Special Foundation for Basic Research Program in Soil of CAS, Grant/Award Number: XDB15030103; Special Foundation for State Major Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0501202; Funding text 2: This research was financially supported by the Special Foundation for State Major Basic Research Program of China (2016YFC0501202), Special Foundation for Basic Research Program in Soil of CAS (XDB15030103), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31370144, 41571255, and 41701332), Key Laboratory Foundation of Mollisols Agroecology (2016ZKHT‐05), and 135 Project of North-east Institute of Geography and Agroecology (Y6H2043001).

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO<inf>2</inf>) for ameliorating soil salinity in broad bean, an important leguminous crop. As nTiO<inf>2</inf> is known to have pro-oxidant and antioxidant properties, the effects of three different nTiO<inf>2</inf> concentrations (0·01%, 0·02% and 0·03%) were compared with respect to plant growth and stress responses. The 0·01% nTiO<inf>2</inf> application significantly increased shoot length, leaf area and root dry weight of plants under normal conditions. These growth-promoting effects were simultaneous with increased levels of chlorophyll b, soluble sugars and proline and enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes. Under saline soil conditions, although proline level and enzymatic antioxidant activities were increased, plant growth significantly reduced. The 0·01% nTiO<inf>2</inf> supplementation significantly increased the activities of enzymatic antioxidants and levels of soluble sugars, amino acids and proline in salt-affected plants versus plants subjected to salinity alone. Thus, the increased antioxidant enzyme activities contributed to the observed reduction in hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde contents, while enhanced levels of proline and other metabolites contributed to osmoprotection, collectively resulting in significant plant growth improvement under salinity. Furthermore, nTiO<inf>2</inf>-mediated positive effects were concentration dependent with 0·01% nTiO<inf>2</inf> being the most effective, whereas 0·02% showed an intermediate response and 0·03% was almost ineffective under both control and saline soil conditions. Our findings provide a foundation for nTiO<inf>2</inf> application in improving growth of plants cultivated on naturally contaminated saline soils.

However, soybean yield is detrimentally affected by soil salinity around the world. To cope with soil salinization, in addition to soil remediation, approaches used in genetically modifying soybean genotypes to increase their productivity under saline conditions are also of importance. Thus, it is crucial to unravel the mechanisms controlling soybean responses to soil salinity in order to improve soybean performance with high salinity tolerance. Knowledge of the regulatory network for salt tolerance in model plants, including Arabidopsis, and the publically available soybean genome sequence has accelerated identification and functional analyses of genes regulating soybean responses to high salinity. This review presents an update of recent works on genetic studies of salt tolerance and the mechanisms regulating soybean responses and tolerance to soil salinity.

They provide training and testing materials so that different algorithms can be compared. However, it is not a trivial task to construct high-quality treebanks. We have not yet had a proper treebank for such a low-resource language as Vietnamese, which has probably lowered the performance of Vietnamese language processing. We have been building a consistent and accurate Vietnamese treebank to alleviate such situations. Our treebank is annotated with three layers: word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and bracketing. We developed detailed annotation guidelines for each layer by presenting Vietnamese linguistic issues as well as methods of addressing them. Here, we also describe approaches to controlling annotation quality while ensuring a reasonable annotation speed. We specifically designed an appropriate annotation process and an effective process to train annotators. In addition, we implemented several support tools to improve annotation speed and to control the consistency of the treebank. The results from experiments revealed that both inter-annotator agreement and accuracy were higher than 90%, which indicated that the treebank is reliable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consistent Annotation; Linguistic Challenges; Quality Control; Vietnamese Treebank","","","","","Treebanks, (2003); Allauzen, Alexandre, LIMSI@WMT'16: Machine Translation of News, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, pp. 239-245, (2016); Barr, Cory, The linguistic structure of English web-search queries, pp. 1021-1030, (2008); Bracketing Guidelines for Treebank II Style Penn Treebank Project, (1995); Cai, Jingsheng, Dependency-based pre-ordering for Chinese-English machine translation, 2, pp. 155-160, (2014); Chang, Pichuan, Optimizing Chinese word segmentation for machine translation performance, pp. 224-232, (2008); Chinkina, Maria, Online Information Retrieval for language learning, pp. 7-12, (2016); Vietnamese Dictionary, (2025); Vietnamese Grammar, (2005); Dinh, Dien H., A maximum entropy approach for Vietnamese word segmentation, pp. 248-253, (2006)","","Springer Netherlands rbk@louisiana.edu","","","","","","1574020X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025427505"

We proposed a tourism model for the regional promotion of footpaths as the main axis in the ""Agri-culture System"" designated as part of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Applying a Contingent Valuation Method, we asked walkers how much they were willing to contribute to various GIAHS-related activities through volunteering in addition to the participation fee for the walk. We hypothesized that the diverse means and activities to support conservation would contribute to sustainable management of GIAHS. The research findings showed that walkers had options to choose which activity to support. For track maintenance, WTCL in volunteering is 4.23 days a year. In the case of walkers who had no options, their Willingness to Contribute in Labor (WTCL) by volunteering is 3.34 days a year. To link the regional resources used for tourism with GIAHS require their effective management and conservation. Thus, it is desirable to formulate a combined approach such as payments by users of the trails and contributions through volunteer activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contingent Valuation Method; Footpath; Giahs; Long Trail; Stated Preference; Sustainable Rural Management; Volunteering; Willingness To Contribute In Labor; Contingent Valuation; Development Strategy; Ecotourism; Labor; Maintenance; Management Practice; Model; Public Goods; Regional Development; Road; Voluntary Approach; Walking","contingent valuation; development strategy; ecotourism; labor; maintenance; management practice; model; public goods; regional development; road; voluntary approach; walking","","","This research is supported by an Oita Prefecture GIAHS research grant of 2016.

More specifically, the tangible and intangible values of ecosystem services (ES) associated with specific land uses/land covers have been appreciated by practitioners both in academia and policy arenas as useful accounting means for land use management. This paper explored how the outcomes from ecosystem valuation studies could be utilized to improve the current agricultural land pricing system in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. By reviewing the relevant legal documents, we highlighted some limitations of the current land pricing system and suggested reforms utilizing ES valuation results. By comparing the results of ES evaluation study for the prawn-rice rotational crops (PRRC) areas with their regulated agricultural land prices, one major limitation of the current pricing method was identified, that being its inability to capture the actual land profitability resulting from the classification system of lands which currently typifies PRRC areas as annual crops, similar to rice and vegetables. However, to register a dedicated classification for PRRC can be time consuming and costly due to the complexity of the relevant legal framework. As a response, an ES-based index to account for the differences between PRRC and other cultivation systems without having to thoroughly reform the legal system was recommended. Our recommendation is essentially in harmony with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Decree, which allows for the application of correction factors according to local conditions. As a methodological contribution, this attempt to include ES information in legal systems could facilitate the better standardization of core terminologies and practical guidelines, two of the most important challenges to the mainstreaming of the ES concept in decision making and policy planning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystem Services; Land Prices; Land Use; Mekong Delta; Rotational Crops","","","","Funding text 1: Co-author Ho Huu Loc thanks his scholarship donor, Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Grant no: 143482) (Monbukagakusho: MEXT) for funding this research as a part of his Ph.D work.

Data were collected from enterprises in Vietnam from July 2016 to March 2017. Based on a sample of 144 valid responses, empirical results indicate that quality management practices have mixed impacts on economic performance and environmental performance, while show positive impact on social performance. The results found four quality management practices that have significantly positive impact on sustainability performance: top management support for quality management, design for quality, quality data and reporting, and continuous improvement. These practices could be considered as critical quality management factors that significantly contribute to sustainability goals. Furthermore, the study found significant moderating effects of three contextual factors on the relationship between quality management practices and sustainability performance.

In an 8-year duration, the increment was 53 ± 10 stems ha–1, 7.8 ± 0.3 m2 ha–1 for BA and 86.0 ± 4.6 Mg ha–1 for AGB. The stem mortality rate was 0.9% year–1 and the stem recruitment rate was 2.2% year–1. Annual ΔAGB was 10.8 Mg ha–1 year–1, equaling to 5.4 Mg C ha–1 year–1. Of which, tree stems of 35–80 cm DBH classes accounted for 65%. The results indicated that the forest is in stage of carbon sequestration. Any disturbances causing death of 35–80 cm DBH tree stems will much reduce carbon sequestration capacity and it will take a long time for AGB to return to pre-disturbance stage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Sequestration; Mortality Rate; Recruitment Rate; Southeast Asian; Stem Size; Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Population Statistics; Aboveground Biomass Increments; Biomass Accumulation; Carbon Sequestration; Diameter-at-breast Heights; Evergreen Broad-leaved Forests; Mortality Rate; Recruitment Rates; Southeast Asian; Forestry; Aboveground Biomass; Broad-leaved Forest; Carbon Sequestration; Evergreen Forest; Mortality; Recruitment (population Dynamics); Stand Dynamics; Stem; Basal Area; Chelation; Forests; Mortality; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Population statistics; Aboveground biomass increments; Biomass accumulation; Carbon sequestration; Diameter-at-breast heights; Evergreen broad-leaved forests; Mortality rate; Recruitment rates; Southeast Asian; Forestry; aboveground biomass; broad-leaved forest; carbon sequestration; evergreen forest; mortality; recruitment (population dynamics); stand dynamics; stem; Basal Area; Chelation; Forests; Mortality; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 106-NN.06-2016.10.","Achard, Frédéric, Determination of deforestation rates of the world's humid tropical forests, Science, 297, 5583, pp. 999-1002, (2002); Adachi, Minako, Carbon budget of tropical forests in Southeast Asia and the effects of deforestation: An approach using a process-based model and field measurements, Biogeosciences, 8, 9, pp. 2635-2647, (2011); Baker, Timothy R., Increasing biomass in Amazonian forest plots, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 359, 1443, pp. 353-365, (2004); Sci Technol J Agric Rural Dev, (2009); Bonan, Gordon B., Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests, Science, 320, 5882, pp. 1444-1449, (2008); Brown, Irving Foster, Uncertainty in the biomass of Amazonian forests: An example from Rondônia, Brazil, Forest Ecology and Management, 75, 1-3, pp. 175-189, (1995); Brown, Sandra L., Measuring carbon in forests: Current status and future challenges, Environmental Pollution, 116, 3, pp. 363-372, (2002); Long Term Impacts of Logging Intensity on Forest Structure and Stand Dynamics of Tropical Evergreen Broad Leaved Forest in Kon Ha Nung Central Highlands of Vietnam, (2015); Chave, Jérôme, Estimation of biomass in a neotropical forest of French Guiana: Spatial and temporal variability, Journal of Tropical Ecology, 17, 1, pp. 79-96, (2001); Clark, Deborah A., Measuring net primary production in forests: Concepts and field methods, Ecological Applications, 11, 2, pp. 356-370, (2001)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","1540756X; 10549811","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030150899"

Although there have been several research projects on syntactic parsing in Vietnamese, the parsing quality has been far inferior than those reported in major languages, such as English and Chinese. In this work, we evaluated representative constituency parsing models on a Vietnamese Treebank to look for the most suitable parsing method for Vietnamese. We then combined the advantages of automatic and manual analysis to investigate errors produced by the experimented parsers and find the reasons for them. Our analysis focused on three possible sources of parsing errors, namely limited training data, part-of-speech (POS) tagging errors, and ambiguous constructions. As a result, we found that the last two sources, which frequently appear in Vietnamese text, significantly attributed to the poor performance of Vietnamese parsing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Natural Language Processing Systems; Syntactics; Automatic Analysis; Data Parts; Empirical Investigation; Error Types; Limited Training Data; Manual Analysis; Parsing Methods; Syntactic Parsing; Treebanks; Vietnamese; Errors","Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Syntactics; Automatic analysis; Data parts; Empirical investigation; Error types; Limited training data; Manual analysis; Parsing methods; Syntactic parsing; Treebanks; Vietnamese; Errors","","","","Le, AnhCuong, An experimental study on lexicalized statistical parsing for Vietnamese, pp. 162-167, (2009); On the Parameter Space of Generative Lexicalized Statistical Parsing Models, (2004); Coavoux, Maximin, Incremental discontinuous phrase structure parsing with the GAP transition, 2, pp. 1259-1270, (2017); Durrett, Greg, Neural CRF Parsing, 1, pp. 302-312, (2015); Dyer, Chris J., Recurrent neural network grammars, pp. 199-209, (2016); Finkel, Jenny Rose, Efficient, feature-based, conditional random field parsing, pp. 959-967, (2008); Hall, David, Less grammar, more features, 1, pp. 228-237, (2014); Hara, Tadayoshi, Descriptive and empirical approaches to capturing underlying dependencies among parsing errors, pp. 1162-1171, (2009); Klein, Dan, Accurate unlexicalized parsing, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2003-July, (2003); Kummerfeld, Jonathan K., Parser showdown at the wall street corral: An empirical investigation of error types in parser output, pp. 1048-1059, (2012)","Bender, E.M.; Derczynski, L.; Isabelle, P.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","Amazon Alexa; Baidu; Disney Research; et al.; Lenovo; Linguist List","27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING 2018","","Santa Fe; NM","172932","","9781948087506","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119423789"

It is especially crucial for Natural Language Generation (NLG) in Spoken Dialogue Systems when there are sufficient annotated data in the source domain, but there is a limited labeled data in the target domain. How to effectively utilize as much of existing abilities from source domains is a crucial issue in domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training procedure to train a Variational encoder-decoder based language generator via multiple adaptation steps. In this procedure, a model is first trained on a source domain data and then fine-tuned on a small set of target domain utterances under the guidance of two proposed critics. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively leverage the existing knowledge in the source domain to adapt to another related domain by using only a small amount of in-domain data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Knowledge Management; Natural Language Processing Systems; Dialogue Systems; Domain Adaptation; Encoder-decoder; Labeled Data; Language Generation; Language Generators; Natural Language Generation; Spoken Dialogue System; Target Domain; Training Procedures; Speech Processing","Computational linguistics; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Dialogue systems; Domain adaptation; Encoder-decoder; Labeled data; Language generation; Language generators; Natural language generation; Spoken dialogue system; Target domain; Training procedures; Speech processing","","","This work was supported by the JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR1513, the JSPS KAKENHI Grant number 15K16048 and the SIS project.","Generating Sentences from A Continuous Space, (2015); Chen, Xie, Recurrent neural network language model adaptation for multi-genre broadcast speech recognition, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2015-January, pp. 3511-3515, (2015); Chung, Junyoung, A recurrent latent variable model for sequential data, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015-January, pp. 2980-2988, (2015); Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks, (2016); Ganin, Yaroslav, Domain-adversarial training of neural networks, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17, (2016); Auto Encoding Variational Bayes, (2013); Levin, Esther, The at&t-DARPA Communicator mixed-initiative spoken dialog system, (2000); Mairesse, François, Controlling user perceptions of linguistic style: Trainable generation of personality traits, Computational Linguistics, 37, 3, pp. 455-488, (2011); Mairesse, François, Phrase-based statistical language generation using graphical models and active learning, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2010-July, pp. 1552-1561, (2010); International Conference on Machine Learning, (2016)","Bender, E.M.; Derczynski, L.; Isabelle, P.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","Amazon Alexa; Baidu; Disney Research; et al.; Lenovo; Linguist List","27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING 2018","","Santa Fe; NM","172932","","9781948087506","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084071344"

This is due to the fact that NEP of a forest is the amount of carbon accumulated in a unit of area and time. This chapter discusses NEP in tropical broad-leaved forests of the Copia Natural Reserve, northwest Vietnam and the need for a carbon certificate to support the local community. Based on field research in northwest Vietnam, this chapter proposes a modified and easily applicable method for estimating NEP. Research results indicate that one hectare of secondary broad-leaved forest in Vietnam can accumulate 6.57 Mg C y−1, more than twice that of old-growth forest at 2.57 Mg C y−1. Research suggests that NEP is higher than some other forests around the world. We suggest that a price should minimally sustain the livelihood of forest protectors, at around 10 US$/ton carbon, a price much higher than current government payments of 10 US$ ha y−1, regardless of carbon accumulation. This chapter asserts the importance of issuing forest carbon certificate to forest protectors so that local communities can raise their bargaining power to improve their income while at the same time, protect the natural forests sustainably. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Market; Carbon Sequestration; Poverty Reduction; Southeast Asia; Tropical Forests","","","","Acknowledgments This research was funded by Vietnamese National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), under grant number 106-NN.06-2016.10.","Adachi, Minako, Carbon budget of tropical forests in Southeast Asia and the effects of deforestation: An approach using a process-based model and field measurements, Biogeosciences, 8, 9, pp. 2635-2647, (2011); Baishya, Ratul, Estimation of tree biomass, carbon pool and net primary production of an old-growth Pinus kesiya Royle ex.

Secondly, tweets are assigned into sub-topics divided by consecutive days, which facilitate incremental tweet stream summarization methods. To reveal the potential usefulness of our dataset, we compare several well-known summarization methods. Experimental results indicate that among extractive approaches, hybrid term frequency - document term frequency obtains competitive results in term of ROUGE-scores.

Specifically, it compares paintings to photographs, addressing the strengths and limitations of both. Particular aesthetic practices are examined such as the vista, foreground to background organisation and the depth planes. These are analysed using a range of computational approaches and clear observations are made. New generations of image-capture devices such as Google goggles and the light field camera, promise a future in which the formal attributes of a photograph are made available for editing to a degree that has hitherto been the exclusive territory of painting. In this sense paintings and photographs are converging, and it therefore seems an opportune time to study the comparisons between them. In this context, the book includes cutting-edge work examining how some of the aesthetic attributes of a painting can be transferred to a photograph using the latest computational approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Landscape and Western Art, (1999); Landscape Portrait Still Life their Origin and Development, (1963); Creative Illustration, (1947); John Constable S Skies A Fusion of Art and Science, (1999); Art and Visual Perception A Psychology of the Creative Eye, (1974); Arnheim, Rudolf, Visual Thinking, pp. 1-348, (2023); Theory and Practice of Landscape Painting in Water Colours, (1855); Color Harmony Color Research and Application, (2002); De La Loi Du Contraste Simultane Des Couleurs Et De L Assortiment Des Objets Colores, (1839); undefined","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9789811035616; 9789811035593","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051682595"

However, the model has failed to describe the starting point of the process, and no-sense of lag phase constant has been pointed out. Thus, the goal of this study is to develop a new kinetic model of biogas production with meaningful constants that can alternate the Gompertz model. The kinetic constants of the model were determined by applying the least squares fitting method for experimental data. The experimental data were taken from running seven batch reactors of co-digestion of vegetable, sludge and horse manure under 37oC, pH of 6.7, and total solids of 2.5%. The result of the high coefficient of determination (0.9611- 0.9906) demonstrated that the new biogas production kinetic model was feasible to simulate the biogas generation process. This finding has opened a new choice that can deal with simulation of the biogas production. Moreover, co-digestion of vegetable, horse manure, and sludge was also evaluated under strong attention. The biogas potential was in the range of 183-648 Nml/g-VS with the best carbon-tonitrogen ratio of 16. Vegetable waste played a major role in producing the biogas yield while horse manure and sludge contributed to balancing nutrient of the digestion process. Also, the strong correlation between carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and kinetic constants confirmed that the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio was the key factor that influenced biogas generation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic Digester; Batch Reactor; Co-digestion; Kinetics; Mesophilic Digestion","","","","","Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (2025); Appels, Lise, Principles and potential of the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge, Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 34, 6, pp. 755-781, (2008); Beardmore, David H., Gamma-ray irradiation as a pretreatment for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, Biotechnology Letters, 2, 10, pp. 435-438, (1980); Bouallagui, Hassib, Improvement of fruit and vegetable waste anaerobic digestion performance and stability with co-substrates addition, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, 5, pp. 1844-1849, (2009); Dai, Xiaohu, Simultaneous enhancement of methane production and methane content in biogas from waste activated sludge and perennial ryegrass anaerobic co-digestion: The effects of pH and C/N ratio, Bioresource Technology, 216, pp. 323-330, (2016); J Renew Sustain Energy, (2015); Deng, Yanfei, Biogas as a sustainable energy source in China: Regional development strategy application and decision making, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 35, pp. 294-303, (2014); Gómez, Xiomar, Anaerobic co-digestion of primary sludge and the fruit and vegetable fraction of the municipal solid wastes.

This study investigates the damages and recovery of coastal morphology and the reconstruction of the coastal embankment along the coast, based on satellite images. During the recovery process, full recovery of breaching was observed at the areas with sufficient sediment supply from adjacent sandy coasts. However, in the areas without adjacent sandy coasts, the formation of tsunami embayment was found. The relationship between the measured area of adjacent sandy coasts, A<inf>S</inf>, and the measured area of breaching of the sandy coast, A<inf>B</inf>, indicates that the formation of tsunami embayment takes place in case A<inf>B</inf> greater than in A<inf>S</inf> and vice versa. There are two types of cross sections of reconstructed embankment. Due to the formation of a tsunami embayment in several areas, a setback of approximately 30 m of the reconstructed embankment has been made.

Yet across many disciplines in tertiary education, students are required to attend and participate in these speaking and listening events. EAP students need to be prepared for them, and their textbooks should help them prepare also. The present study included interview data from lecturers and students which identified specific issues with speaking in small groups in university; corpus-based analysis of tutorials and laboratory sessions which showed large amounts of high frequency vocabulary; and an EAP/ESP textbook analysis showed little focus on vocabulary in tutorials and nothing on laboratories. A total of 176 phrases were suggested in three textbooks as being useful for expressions for speaking in small groups. An analysis of these phrases in the corpus showed that three quarters of these phrases did not appear in the laboratory corpus and two thirds did not appear in the tutorial corpus. Finally, lexical patterns from the corpus were identified and categorised in the same way as existing lists of multiword units in spoken academic English.

The impact of sea level variations related to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Neolithic diffusion on past population dispersals are two key issues. We have investigated competing AMH dispersal hypotheses in SEA through the analysis of dental phenotype shape variation on the basis of very large archaeological samples employing two complementary approaches. We first explored the structure of between- and within-group shape variation of permanent human molar crowns. Second, we undertook a direct test of competing hypotheses through a modeling approach. Our results identify a significant LGM-mediated AMH expansion and a strong biological impact of the spread of Neolithic farmers into SEA during the Holocene. The present work thus favors a “multiple AMH dispersal” hypothesis for the population history of SEA, reconciling phenotypic and recent genomic data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contour Analysis; Geometric Morphometrics; Homo Sapiens; Last Glacial Maximum; Neolithic Expansion; Population History; Anatomy; Archaeology; Dentition; Genomics; Last Glacial Maximum; Morphometry; Neolithic; Phenotype; Population Characteristics; Southeast Asia; Homo Sapiens; Anatomy And Histology; Biological Variation; Human; Mandible; Migration; Molar Tooth; Physical Anthropology; Population Dynamics; Anthropology, Physical; Asia, Southeastern; Biological Variation, Population; Human Migration; Humans; Mandible; Molar; Population Dynamics","anatomy; archaeology; dentition; genomics; Last Glacial Maximum; morphometry; Neolithic; phenotype; population characteristics; Southeast Asia; Homo sapiens; anatomy and histology; biological variation; human; mandible; migration; molar tooth; physical anthropology; population dynamics; Anthropology, Physical; Asia, Southeastern; Biological Variation, Population; Human Migration; Humans; Mandible; Molar; Population Dynamics","","","We would like to dedicate this work to the memory of Laurent Puymerail.

Among the causes of bicycle accidents, the loss of control due to inadequate handlebar control is a particularly common one. So, investigation of handlebar controllability (HC) is an important part in finding ways to deal with this type of accident. In this study, HC was examined considering the effect of pavement roughness level and the interaction effects of Age and Gender. The results showed that cyclist’s HC was negatively affected by pavement roughness level. The examination ofthe interaction effect of cyclists’ age on the correlation between HC and pavement roughness level indicated that elderly cyclists generally suffer more from the effect of pavement roughness on their HC, compared to younger ones. Especially, as they get older, the effect of pavement roughness on their HC even becomes greater. The interaction effect of Gender was found not to be significant. The results of this study could help in proposing countermeasures to deal with accidents resulting from loss of control and it may also serve as a basis for further studies on the potential field of HC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age; Cyclists’ Handlebar Controllability; Gender; Loss Of Control Accident; Pavement Roughness; Accidents; Controllability; Highway Accidents; Surface Roughness; Bicycle Accidents; Gender; Interaction Effect; Loss Of Control; Loss-of-control Accidents; Pavement Roughness; Pavement Roughness Levels; Potential Field; Pavements","Accidents; Controllability; Highway accidents; Surface roughness; Bicycle accidents; Gender; Interaction effect; Loss of control; Loss-of-control accidents; Pavement roughness; Pavement roughness levels; Potential field; Pavements","","","","Arpinar-Avsar, Pinar, The effects of surface-induced loads on forearm muscle activity during steering a bicycle, Journal of Sports Science and Medicine, 12, 3, pp. 512-520, (2013); Ayachi, Fouaz Sofiane, Identifying factors of bicycle comfort: An online survey withenthusiast cyclists, Applied Ergonomics, 46, Part A, pp. 124-136, (2015); Beckett, Laurel A., Analysis of change in self-reported physical function among older persons in four population studies, American Journal of Epidemiology, 143, 8, pp. 766-778, (1996); Trb 2003 Annual Meeting, (2003); Bland, John Martin Artin, Measurement error, BMJ, 312, 7047, (1996); Boufous, Soufiane, Single- versus multi-vehicle bicycle road crashes in Victoria, Australia, Injury Prevention, 19, 5, pp. 358-362, (2013); Integration of Smart Phone Based Pavement Roughness Data Collection Tool with Asset Management System, (2014); Development of A Performance Based Specification for A Major Bicycle Facility; Carter, C., Future for cycling, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Transport, 117, 3, pp. 231-233, (1996); undefined, (2016)","","Aracne Ed alessandro.calvi@uniromab.it Via Delle Strelitzie, 35, Sama Palomba, Roma 00134","","","","","","18245463","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032825837"

Although transition probabilities of Markov models are generally estimated using inspection data, it is not uncommon that there are situations where there are inadequate data available to estimate the transition probabilities. In this article, a methodology is proposed to estimate the transition probabilities from mechanistic-empirical models for reinforced concrete elements. The proposed methodology includes the estimation of the transition probabilities analytically when possible and when not through the use of Bayesian statistics, which requires the formulation of a likelihood function and the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. In an example, the difference between the average condition predicted over a 100-year time period with a Markov model developed using the proposed methodology and the condition predicted using mechanistic-empirical models were found to be 54% of that when the state-of-the-art methodology, i.e., a methodology that estimates the transition probabilities using best fit curves based on yearly condition distributions, was used. The variation in accuracy of the Markov model as a function of the number of deterioration paths generated using the mechanistic-empirical models is also shown. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Statistics; Bridge Management; Markov Chain Models; Mechanistic-empirical Corrosion Models; Reinforced Concrete Bridges","","","","","Pontis Release 4 0 Technical Manual, (2004); Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, (1763); Camahan, J.

The Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model was used to assess seven scenarios having the same socioeconomic development but different shares of RE in power generation. By comparing different relative reductions caused by the emission constraints vis-a-vis the business-as-usual (BaU) scenario, the mitigation costs can be estimated. Results show that the economic impact could be reduced by around 55% in terms of welfare loss (from 6.0 to 2.7%) and by around 36% in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) loss (from 3.4 to 2.1%) through the incorporation of high levels of renewable energy. Furthermore, the additional double deployment of wind and SPV to 5.4% and 12.0%, respectively, which currently comprise 43.1% of the renewable energies used in electricity generation, could reduce the GDP loss from 2.1 to 1.9% and reduce the welfare loss from 2.7 to 1.5% in order to achieve a 25.0% GHG emissions reduction. These losses are less than those in the pricing-only scenario (2.1% and 2.3%, respectively). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aim/cge Model; Emissions Gap; Energy Outlook Of Vietnam; Intended Nationally Determined Contribution; Power Development Plan; Renewable Energies","","","","","APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook, (2025); Bertram, Christoph D., Complementing carbon prices with technology policies to keep climate targets within reach, Nature Climate Change, 5, 3, pp. 235-239, (2015); Intended Nationally Determined Contributions What are the Implications for Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2030, (2015); Dai, Hancheng, Key factors affecting long-term penetration of global onshore wind energy integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches, Renewable Energy, 85, pp. 19-30, (2016); Dung, Trinh Quang, P.V Technology and success of solar electricity in Vietnam, Conference Record of the IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, pp. 1309-1312, (1997); England, Sarah Beatrice, Energy resources and development in Vietnam, Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, pp. 137-167, (1993); Erickson, Peter A., Assessing carbon lock-in, Environmental Research Letters, 10, 8, (2015); AIM Cge Basic Manual, (2012); Fujimori, Shinichiro, Development of a global computable general equilibrium model coupled with detailed energy end-use technology, Applied Energy, 128, pp. 296-306, (2014); Fujimori, Shinichiro, The effectiveness of energy service demand reduction: A scenario analysis of global climate change mitigation, Energy Policy, 75, pp. 379-391, (2014)","","Springer Singapore","","","","","","","9789811038686; 9789811038693","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038220706"

Waste sampling, followed by a questionnaire survey, was carried out to gather data. The Bayesian model average method was used to identify factors significantly associated with waste generation. Multivariate linear regression analysis was then applied to evaluate the impacts of significant factors on household waste production. The model obtained from this study indicated that household location, household size, house area per person, and family economic activity are important determinants of the waste generation rate. The models could explain about 34% of the variation of the per capita daily waste generation rate. Diagnostic tests and model validation results showed that the regression model could provide reliable results of estimated household waste. The study revealed that per capita urban household waste generation is 70-80% higher compared to a rural household. The models also showed that if a family ran a business from home, the household waste generation rate would increase by about 35%. This result provides reliable information for better waste collection and management planning. Two other significant variables (family size and house area per capita) do not contribute much (less than 20%) to waste generation. Variables accounting for household income, presence of a garden, number of rooms in a house, and percentage of members of different ages were proven to be not significant. The study provides a reliable method for estimating household waste generation, providing decision makers useful information for waste management policy development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Model Average (bma); Multivariate Linear Regression; Municipal Solid Waste Management (mswm); Prognosis Model; Waste Generation","","","","","Abbasi, Maryam, Forecasting municipal solid waste generation by hybrid support vector machine and partial least square model, International Journal of Environmental Research, 7, 1, pp. 27-38, (2013); Abdoli, Mohammad Ali, Integrated solid waste management in megacities, Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management, 2, 3, pp. 289-298, (2016); Abu Qdais, Hani Ahmad, Analysis of residential solid waste at generation sites, Waste Management and Research, 15, 4, pp. 395-406, (1997); Akhtar, Sana, Assessment of willingness to pay for improved air quality using contingent valuation method, Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management, 3, 3, pp. 279-286, (2017); Bach, Heinz, Combining socio-demographic and logistic factors to explain the generation and collection of waste paper, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 41, 1, pp. 65-73, (2004); Bdour, Ahmed N., Assessment of medical wastes management practice: A case study of the northern part of Jordan, Waste Management, 27, 6, pp. 746-759, (2007); Beigl, Peter, Modelling municipal solid waste generation: A review, Waste Management, 28, 1, pp. 200-214, (2008); Ojeda-Benítez, Sara Ojeda, Mathematical modeling to predict residential solid waste generation, Waste Management, 28, SUPPL. 1, pp. S7-S13, (2008); Bernache Pérez, Gerardo, Solid waste characterisation study in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone, Mexico, Waste Management and Research, 19, 5, pp. 413-424, (2001); Bleeker, Sacha E., External validation is necessary in prediction research: A clinical example, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 56, 9, pp. 826-832, (2003)","","Iran Solid Waste Association","","","","","","23833572; 23833866","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043335333"

Data from 30 surveyed sampling sites over the lake water in June 2016 and May 2017 demonstrated the appropriateness of S2A green-red band ratio (band 3 versus band 4) for estimating Chla. This was shown through a strong correlation of corresponded field measured reflectance ratio with Chla by an exponential curve (r2 = 0.68; the mean standard error of the estimates corresponding to 5% of the mean value of in situ Chla). The small error between in situ Chla, and estimated Chla from S2A acquired concurrently, confirmed the S2A green-red band ratio as the most suitable option for monitoring Chla in Lake Ba Be water. Resultant Chla distribution maps over time described a partially-seasonal pattern and also displayed the spatial dynamic of Chla in the lake. This allows a better understanding of the lake's limnological processes to be developed and provides an insight into the factors that affect lake water quality. The results also confirmed the potential of S2A to be used as a free tool for lake monitoring and research due to high spatial resolution data (10 m pixel size). © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algae Blooms; Algorithms; Limnology; Remote Sensing; Water Quality","","","","Acknowledgments: This study was funded by the National Foundation for Science and Technology of Vietnam, coding NAFOSTED 105.08-2013.12.

The talking robot is constructed with mechanical parts that are made by referring to human vocal organs biologically and functionally. In this study, a newly redesign artificial vocal cord is developed for the purpose of extending the speaking capability of the talking robot. The artificial vocal cord is developed using functional approach. A thin layer of rubber band with a width of 7mm is attached on a plastic body in a sealed chamber creates an artificial sound source. The fundamental frequency of the sound source vary from 80Hz to 280 Hz depending on the pressure to the rubber band and the curving shape of the rubber band. The curving shape of the rubber band is adjustable by an innovative design mechanism driven by a servo motor. The amount of air pressure applied to the rubber band is controlled by another servo motor which is referred as volume motor in this study. The experiment to verify the speak capability of the talking robot with this newly redesigned vocal cord is conducted by letting the robot generating five vowel sounds with difference combination of 20 levels of rubber band shape and 10 levels of air pressure input. The pitch and volume of each sound is extracted to determine the effect of the rubber band shape and the pressure input on the output sound. The result shows that this newly redesigned vocal cord greatly increase the speaking capability of the talking robot, especially its singing performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Vocal Cord; Curving Shape; Fundamental Frequency; Pressure; Talking-robot; Acoustic Generators; Atmospheric Pressure; Natural Frequencies; Pressure; Robots; Rubber; Speech Processing; Curving Shape; Functional Approach; Fundamental Frequencies; Innovative Design; Mechanical Parts; Singing Performance; Talking Robots; Vocal Cords; Audition","Acoustic generators; Atmospheric pressure; Natural frequencies; Pressure; Robots; Rubber; Speech processing; Curving shape; Functional approach; Fundamental frequencies; Innovative design; Mechanical parts; Singing performance; Talking robots; Vocal cords; Audition","","","This work was partly supported by the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (No. 15K01459).","Articulatory Phonetics Tools for Analyzing the World S Languages, (2006); Takemoto, Hironori, Acoustic analysis of the vocal tract during vowel production by finite-difference time-domain method, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 128, 6, pp. 3724-3738, (2010); Guenther, Frank H., Neural modeling and imaging of the cortical interactions underlying syllable production, Brain and Language, 96, 3, pp. 280-301, (2006); EPJ Nonlinear Biomedical Physics, (2014); Hearing Impairments in Young Children, (1982); Erber, Norman P., Voice/mouth synthesis and tactual/visual perception of /pa, ba, ma/, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 64, 4, pp. 1015-1019, (1978); Kitani, Mitsuki, A talking robot and its singing performance by the mimicry of human vocalization, Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing, 99, pp. 57-73, (2012); Robust Speech Recognition and Understanding, (2007); Ieie Transactions on Smart Processing and Computing, (2016); Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, (2007)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","BK21 Plus Project, University of Ulsan; University of Ulsan","10th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2017","","Ulsan; International Hall, University of Ulsan","129837","","9781509046881","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030235488"

This phenomenon is due to the effect of the degradation of water environment. Turbidity is one of the most important water quality parameters directly related to underwater light penetration which affects the primary productivity. This study aims to investigate spatiotemporal variation of turbidity in the waters with major factors affecting its patterns using remote sensing data. An algorithm for turbidity retrieval was developed based on the correlation between in situ measurements and a red band of Landsat 8 OLI with R2 = 0.84 (p < 0.05). Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was used to compute bed shear stress, a major factor affecting turbidity in shallow waters. In addition, the relationships between turbidity and rainfall, and bed shear stress induced by wind were analyzed. It was found that: (1) In the dry season, turbidity was low at the middle of the bay while it was high in shallow waters nearby coastlines. Resuspension of bed sediment was a major factor controlling turbidity during time with no rainfall. (2) In the rainy season or for a short time after rainfall in the dry season, turbidity was high due to a large amount of runoff entering into the study area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bed Shear Stress; Fresh Water Runoff; Oceanic Water Intrusion; Remote Sensing Reflectance; Seagrass Beds; Turbidity; Cams; Drought; Plants (botany); Rain; Remote Sensing; Runoff; Shear Flow; Shear Stress; Water Quality; Bed Shear Stresss; Fresh Water; Oceanic Waters; Remote-sensing Reflectance; Seagrass Beds; Turbidity","Cams; Drought; Plants (botany); Rain; Remote sensing; Runoff; Shear flow; Shear stress; Water quality; Bed shear stresss; Fresh Water; Oceanic waters; Remote-sensing reflectance; Seagrass beds; Turbidity","","","The authors would like to thank researchers working in Institute of Oceanography, Tong Phuoc Hoang Son, Le Thi Vinh, Phan Minh Thu and Bui Hong Long, for their kind supports in this research.

Here we identified and evaluated potential adaptation strategies for adapting to sea-level rise, based on the experiences of four low-lying island communities in central Philippines that have experienced flooding during normal high tides since a 2013 earthquake that induced land subsidence. Coastal surveys, interviews and household questionnaires showed that island residents generally prefer in situ adaptation strategies rather than relocation to the mainland. These results are unexpected, particularly because a relocation programme has been developed by authorities on the mainland. Direct measurements during a flooding event indicate stilted housing as the most effective type of adaptation strategy.

It seems there is a conflict between evacuation shelter planning and the current evacuation method in Kanazawa city. This research, therefore, contributed a method for comparing two evacuation scenarios that include going to main shelters in school districts (hereafter scenario 1) and going to nearest main shelters in the city (hereafter scenario 2). Based on total evacuation distances from evacuees' houses to main shelters; four distance categories of 2km service areas were made: 0-500m, 500-1000m, 1000-2000m, and over 2000m; and a supply-Todemand ratio of each main shelter. Results showed that scenario 2 was better and more convenient to evacuees than scenario 1. The results may also provide a useful reference to disaster managers for reviewing current evacuation method as well as supporting them to rethink a plan for improving current evacuation method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distance Category; Evacuation Simulation; Network Analysis; Service Area; Supply-to-demand Ratio; Total Evacuation Distance; Comparative Study; Disaster Management; Hazard Management; Planning Process; Seismic Hazard; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Kanazawa","comparative study; disaster management; hazard management; planning process; seismic hazard; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Kanazawa","","","","Systems Engineering Procedia, (2012); Report on Earthquake Disaster Assessment in Kanazawa City, (2015); Kilci, Firat, Locating temporary shelter areas after an earthquake: A case for Turkey, European Journal of Operational Research, 243, 1, pp. 323-332, (2015); Fransen, Koos, A commuter-based two-step floating catchment area method for measuring spatial accessibility of daycare centers, Health and Place, 32, pp. 65-73, (2015); Liu, Qiang, Selection of emergency shelter sites for seismic disasters in mountainous regions: Lessons from the 2008 Wenchuan Ms 8.0 Earthquake, China, Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, 40, 4, pp. 926-934, (2011); Delamater, Paul L., Spatial accessibility in suboptimally configured health care systems: A modified two-step floating catchment area (M2SFCA) metric, Health and Place, 24, pp. 30-43, (2013); Plos Curr, (2014); Xü, Jinghai, Multi-criteria location model of earthquake evacuation shelters to aid in urban planning, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 20, pp. 51-62, (2016); Journal of Natural Disaster Science, (2008); Report on Shelter Capacity and Accessibility Estimation During the Emergence Stage of Rescue and Relief in Kanazawa City, (2015)","","Disaster Advances disaster@managein.org","","","","","","22784543; 0974262X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026316723"

In general, behavioral intention and habits explain the deliberate process and the habitual process of travelers’ behavior, respectively. While behavioral intention is considered as a goal-dependent deliberation, habits are not fully defined due to different views of researchers. The stimulus-response approach describes habits as a goal-independent automaticity, whereas the script-based approach views habits as a goal-dependent automaticity. The controversy in understanding the association between goals and habits necessitates a focus on the establishment of habits in which habits are assumed to appear due to a repetition of behavioral intention. With an aim to understand the process of transformation from intentions to habits, this study focuses on a mediated form of intention that is close to habits. It is hypothesized that the mediated form has characteristics similar to those of habits. Empirical support for the hypothesis was obtained in public transportation domain. The findings of this study are important for the field because they present a possibility that past research has investigated the mediated form of intention instead of habits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic Intention; Bus Service; Habit–intention Relation; Intention; Travel Behavior; Bus Transportation; Automatic Intention; Behavioral Intention; Bus Services; Intention; Public Transportation; Stimulus Response; Travel Behaviors; Transportation","Bus transportation; Automatic intention; Behavioral intention; Bus services; Intention; Public transportation; Stimulus response; Travel behaviors; Transportation","","","","Aarts, Henk J.M., Habits as knowledge structures: Automaticity in goal-directed behavior, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, 1, pp. 53-63, (2000); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen, Icek, Residual Effects of Past on Later Behavior: Habituation and Reasoned Action Perspectives, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6, 2, pp. 107-122, (2002); Attitudes Personality and Behavior, (2005); Ajzen, Icek, Attitudes and the Attitude-Behavior Relation: Reasoned and Automatic Processes, European Review of Social Psychology, 11, 1, pp. 1-33, (2000); Bamberg, Sebastian, Choice of Travel Mode in the Theory of Planned Behavior: The Roles of Past Behavior, Habit, and Reasoned Action, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 25, 3, pp. 175-187, (2003); Bamberg, Sebastian, Incentives, morality, or habit?

Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1% and 59.4% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change Adaptation; Ecosystem Services Mapping; Integrated Evaluation Framework; Mekong Delta; Prawn And Rice Rotational Crops","","","","","Atkinson, Giles D., Recent advances in the valuation of ecosystem services and biodiversity, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 28, 1, pp. 22-47, (2012); Proc Roy Soc, (1937); undefined, (2015); Boyd, James W., What are ecosystem services?

As the severe scarcity of water resources because of climate change, water conservation through efficient irrigation has turned into a vital strategy for tea sector in solving this rising challenge. This paper analyzes irrigation water use efficiency of small-scale tea farms in Vietnam and identifies its determinants applying stochastic frontier analysis. Results showed that under decreasing returns to scale, the mean irrigation water use efficiency was 42.19 %, indicating the existence of substantial water waste. If farmers become more efficient in using water, saving 57.81 % of irrigation water is possible unaccompanied by reducing the observed output. The factors affecting tea farms’ irrigation water use efficiency were investigated by Tobit model. Gender, water shortage awareness, soil and water conservation practice, off-farm income share, extension services access and well water utilization showed significant influence on the efficiency of irrigation water.

The results show that all models give consistent signs to the estimated parameters. It is evident that the LCS model is capable of representing gap acceptance and allows exploration of the latent choice made by MVs. Comparison of the models shows that LCS is superior to the traditional MNL and NL models in terms of goodness of fit and provides a more realistic simulation of MV behavior. The effects of geometry and traffic conditions are fully considered in this study, and they are found to significantly influence the choices made by MVs. A longer acceleration lane may provide a relatively larger gap for MVs and, therefore, motivate them to accept the gap. With respect to traffic conditions, an MV tends to reject a gap under low (<20 vehicles/km/lane) or high density (>40 vehicles/km/lane) conditions. However, gap acceptance is more likely when the density is from 20 to 40 vehicles/km/lane. With regard to safety, the concept of time to collision (TTC) is adopted to capture the reactions of MVs to mainline vehicles (MLVs). Both leading and following TTCs (between the MV and the leading/following MLV, respectively) are implemented in the models. Analyses indicate that the TTC thresholds for an MV to reject or accept a gap are 5 and 6 s for the leading and the following TTC, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceleration Lane; Density; Gap Acceptance; Latent Choice Sets; Nested Logit; Time To Collision; Traffic Conditions; Urban Expressway; Density (specific Gravity); Vehicles; Acceleration Lane; Gap Acceptance; Latent Choice Sets; Nested Logit; Time To Collision; Traffic Conditions; Urban Expressway; Highway Traffic Control; Acceleration; Discrete Choice Analysis; Geometry; Modeling; Motorway; Traffic Congestion; Transportation Safety; Urban Transport","Density (specific gravity); Vehicles; Acceleration lane; Gap acceptance; Latent choice sets; Nested logit; Time to collision; Traffic conditions; Urban expressway; Highway traffic control; acceleration; discrete choice analysis; geometry; modeling; motorway; traffic congestion; transportation safety; urban transport","","","","Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on the Theory of Traffic Flow and Transportation, (1996); undefined; Akaike, Hirotsugu, A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, 6, pp. 716-723, (1974); Alhajyaseen, Wael K.M., Left-turn gap acceptance models considering pedestrian movement characteristics, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 50, pp. 175-185, (2013); Allen, Brian L., ANALYSIS OF TRAFFIC CONFLICTS AND COLLISIONS., Transportation Research Record, 667, pp. 67-74, (1978); Balas, Valentina Emilia, Driver assisting by inverse time to collision, (2006); Handbook of Transportation Science, (1999); Ben-Akiva, Moshe E., Discrete choice models with latent choice sets, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 12, 1, pp. 9-24, (1995); Discrete Choice Analysis Theory and Application to Travel Demand, (1985); Bhat, Chandra R., Covariance heterogeneity in nested logit models: Econometric structure and application to intercity travel, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 31, 1, pp. 11-21, (1997)","","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) onlinejls@asce.org","","","","","","0733947X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018908249"

The main objective of this two-part study was to investigate the impacts of land use changes from the master plan on urban climate in Hanoi by 2030. This paper focuses on the assessment of the proposed green strategies in the master plan. Firstly, numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting were conducted for the present land use condition as well as the condition proposed by the master plan under the same extremely hot summer conditions of June 2010. Secondly, the results of the master plan condition were further compared with other scenarios comprising different green strategies for assessing their cooling effects. Based on the results, the daytime peak air temperature in the master plan condition was projected to maintain almost the same level as the current condition. However, the high temperature areas with temperature of 40–41 °C, would expand widely over the planned built-up areas. Further results showed that the green strategies were not necessarily effective at cooling all of the built-up areas, though these strategies largely reduced the air temperature within the green spaces, particularly at night. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Cities; Future Urbanisation; Master Plan; Urban Heat Island; Weather Research And Forecasting; Atmospheric Temperature; Landforms; Population Statistics; Weather Forecasting; Developing Cities; Future Urbanisation; Master Plan; Urban Heat Island; Weather Research And Forecasting; Land Use","Atmospheric temperature; Landforms; Population statistics; Weather forecasting; Developing cities; Future urbanisation; Master plan; Urban heat island; Weather research and forecasting; Land use","","","","Adachi, Sachiho A., Comparison of the impact of global climate changes and urbanization on summertime future climate in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 51, 8, pp. 1441-1454, (2012); Adachi, Sachiho A., Moderation of summertime heat island phenomena via modification of the Urban form in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 53, 8, pp. 1886-1900, (2014); Aflaki, Ardalan, Urban heat island mitigation strategies: A state-of-the-art review on Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong, Cities, 62, pp. 131-145, (2017); Alexander, Paul John, Simulating the impact of urban development pathways on the local climate: A scenario-based analysis in the greater Dublin region, Ireland, Landscape and Urban Planning, 152, pp. 72-89, (2016); Argüeso, Daniel, Temperature response to future urbanization and climate change, Climate Dynamics, 42, 7-8, pp. 2183-2199, (2014); Bowler, Diana E., Urban greening to cool towns and cities: A systematic review of the empirical evidence, Landscape and Urban Planning, 97, 3, pp. 147-155, (2010); Cao, Xin, Quantifying the cool island intensity of urban parks using ASTER and IKONOS data, Landscape and Urban Planning, 96, 4, pp. 224-231, (2010); Chang, Chiru, Effects of urban parks on the local urban thermal environment, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 13, 4, pp. 672-681, (2014); Chen, Xiaoling, Remote sensing image-based analysis of the relationship between urban heat island and land use/cover changes, Remote Sensing of Environment, 104, 2, pp. 133-146, (2006); Chen, Ailian, Effect of urban green patterns on surface urban cool islands and its seasonal variations, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 13, 4, pp. 646-654, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22106707","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017583562"

The mining sector is remarkably significant to the development of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region, because the majority of global trade and investment in this region depends on this sector. Therefore, the assessment of mining sector sustainability at national and global scales in APEC economies is an important task. So far, however, mining sector sustainability assessment frameworks have only been developed at small scales, such as companies and cities. In this study, therefore, it is proposed an indicator-based sustainability assessment framework (iSAF) to assess mining sector sustainability at national and global scales. In this framework, fuzzy logic was utilized to adequately deal with the uncertainty and vagueness of human expressions. The conventional fuzzy scales were suitably modified in the proposed framework to facilitate confident decision-making by the relevant stakeholders. In order to avoid repeatedly conducting the judgment until the acceptable consistency was obtained, iSAF implemented an innovative theory to deal with unacceptable consistencies in judgment. The proposed iSAF was applied to the mining sector of APEC economies using data from the APEC 2010 Project. As for the results, three important criteria including economic, environmental, and social criteria and twenty significant indicators were appropriately selected to cover the actual situation in the sector. The results showed that iSAF was a suitable framework for preventing uncertainty and vagueness in decision-making. iSAF was found to provide crucial support to decision-makers, not only in identifying and structuring the main components contributing to sustainability, but also in pointing out the factors in which significant investment should be made to effectively improve sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahp; Apec; Fuzzy Logic; Mining Sector; Sustainability Assessment Framework; Computer Circuits; Decision Making; Economics; Fuzzy Logic; Mining; Network Function Virtualization; Apec; Decision Makers; Economic Co-operation; Global Scale; Global Trade; Industrial Sector; Mining Sector; Sustainability Assessment; Sustainable Development; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; Decision Making; Developing World; Environmental Economics; Fuzzy Mathematics; Mining Industry; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim","Computer circuits; Decision making; Economics; Fuzzy logic; Mining; Network function virtualization; APEC; Decision makers; Economic Co-operation; Global scale; Global trade; Industrial sector; Mining sector; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; decision making; developing world; environmental economics; fuzzy mathematics; mining industry; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim","","","","Int J Appl Math Inform, (2012); Azapagic, Adisa, Developing a framework for sustainable development indicators for the mining and minerals industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 12, 6, pp. 639-662, (2004); Azapagic, Adisa, Indicators of sustainable development for industry: A general framework, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 78, 4, pp. 243-261, (2000); Biju, P.

There are at least three distinctive contextual aspects comprised to form a set of preferences of a user at each query time: content, intention, and response time. A content preference refers to the low-level or semantic representations of the data that a user is interested in. An intention preference refers to how the content should be regarded as relevant. And a response time preference refers to the ability to control a reasonable wait time. This paper features the dynamic adaptability of a multimedia search system to the contexts of its users and proposes a multicontext-adaptive indexing and search system for video data. The main contribution is the integration of context-based query creation functions with high-performance search algorithms into a unified search system. The indexing method modifies inverted list data structure in order to construct disk-resident databases for large-scale data and efficiently enables a dynamic pruning search mechanism on those indices. We implement a frame-wise video navigation system as an application of the indexing and search system using the a 2.14 TB movie dataset. Experimental studies on this system show the effectiveness of the proposed pruning search method when dealing with dynamic contexts and its comparative high search performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Context-dependent Search; Controllable Response Time; Frame-wise Video Navigation; Inverted Index; Large-scale Multimedia Retrieval","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the continuing support of the H28 Keio University Doctorate Student Grant-in-Aid Program and the Taikichiro Mori Memorial Research Fund 2016.","André, Paul, Designing novel image search interfaces by understanding unique characteristics and usage, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5727 LNCS, PART 2, pp. 340-353, (2009); Anh, Vo Ngoc, Pruned query evaluation using pre-computed impacts, 2006, pp. 372-379, (2006); Batko, Michal, Building a web-scale image similarity search system, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 47, 3, pp. 599-629, (2010); Pp, (2005); Bentley, Jon Louis, Multidimensional Binary Search Trees Used for Associative Searching, Communications of the ACM, 18, 9, pp. 509-517, (1975); Bosch, Anna, Representing shape with a spatial pyramid kernel, pp. 401-408, (2007); SIGIR Forum, (2002); Looking for Information A Survey of Research on Information Seeking Needs and Behavior, (2012); Chandrashekar, Girish, A survey on feature selection methods, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 40, 1, pp. 16-28, (2014); Chatzichristofis, Savvas A., Selection of the proper Compact Composite Descriptor for improving content based image retrieval, pp. 134-140, (2009)","","Springer London","","","","","","2192662X; 21926611","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015617442"

It has been suggested that brain details on endocasts are reproduced better in juvenile than adult primates. Here, we investigated age-related changes in the imprint of the major sulci on the endocranium of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) from the juvenile period to adulthood. Materials and methods: Using CT scans of 25 (12 males, 13 females) cranial specimens from macaques, we generated virtual endocasts to assess imprints of the seven main sulci on the endocranial surface. Expression of each sulcal imprint was evaluated by imprint score method. Results: The degree of expression of sulcal imprints differed between sulci. Arcuate, superior temporal, and principal sulci were well defined, whereas lunate and intraparietal sulci were poorly represented. Sulcal imprints showed significant age-related changes in Japanese macaques from juvenile to elderly. Sulcal imprints showed a slight decrease in degree of expression from the juvenile period (2–4 years) to adolescence (4–6 years), and then remained unchanged until mid-adulthood (15–16 years). The degree of expression of the sulcal imprints significantly decreased from mid-adulthood to old age (>20 years). Conclusions: The degree of expression of the sulcal imprints (relief forms) in inner table bone surface (endocranium) reveals significant age-related decreases in adults. The great decrease starts at around 20 years of age. The endocranial volume showed a significant age-related increase, and thus, it is suggested that the endocranial surface in macaques may be resorbed with advancing age. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain; Endocranium; Macaques; Sulcal Imprints; Virtual Endocast; Adolescence; Adolescent; Adult; Adulthood; Aged; Animal Experiment; Animal Tissue; Brain; Dura Mater; Female; Juvenile; Lunate Bone; Macaca Fuscata; Male; Nonhuman; X-ray Computed Tomography; Young Adult; Aging; Anatomy And Histology; Animal; Macaca; Physical Anthropology; Physiology; Skull; Aging; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Brain; Female; Male; Skull","adolescence; adolescent; adult; adulthood; aged; animal experiment; animal tissue; brain; dura mater; female; juvenile; lunate bone; Macaca fuscata; male; nonhuman; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; aging; anatomy and histology; animal; Macaca; physical anthropology; physiology; skull; Aging; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Brain; Female; Male; Skull","","","","Allen, John S., Looking for the lunate sulcus: A magnetic resonance imaging study in modern humans, Anatomical Record - Part A Discoveries in Molecular, Cellular, and Evolutionary Biology, 288, 8, pp. 867-876, (2006); Bae, Byoung-il, Evolutionarily dynamic alternative splicing of GPR56 Regulates regional cerebral cortical patterning, Science, 343, 6172, pp. 764-768, (2014); Balzeau, Antoine, Internal cranial features of the Mojokerto child fossil (East Java, Indonesia), Journal of Human Evolution, 48, 6, pp. 535-553, (2005); Bastir, Markus, Middle cranial fossa anatomy and the origin of modern humans, Anatomical Record, 291, 2, pp. 130-140, (2008); Bayly, Philip V., Mechanical forces in cerebral cortical folding: A review of measurements and models, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 29, pp. 568-581, (2014); Beaudet, Amélie, Morphoarchitectural variation in South African fossil cercopithecoid endocasts, Journal of Human Evolution, 101, pp. 65-78, (2016); Aging in Nonhuman Primates, (1979); Paleoanthropology, (2008); Bruner, Emiliano, Morphological differences in the parietal lobes within the human genus: A neurofunctional perspective, Current Anthropology, 51, SUPPL. 1, pp. S77-S88, (2010); Human Paleoneurology, (2015)","","Wiley-Liss Inc. info@wiley.com","","","","","","10968644; 00029483","","AJPNA","28299780","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015232600"

This study investigates the shoreline evolution of tropical beaches exposed to monsoon events and storms with a case study in Vietnam, facing the South China Sea, over the particularly active 2013-2014 season, including the Cat-5 Haiyan typhoon. Our continuous video observations show for the first time that long-lasting monsoon events have more persistent impact (longer beach recovery phase) than typhoons. Using a shoreline equilibrium model, we estimate that the seasonal shoreline behavior is driven by the envelope of intra-seasonal events rather than monthly-averaged waves. Finally, the study suggests that the interplay between intra-seasonal event intensity and duration on the one hand and recovery conditions on the other might be of key significance. Their evolution in a variable or changing climate should be considered. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Erosion; Recovery; South China Sea; Storminess; Typhoons; Vietnam; Winter Monsoon; Atmospheric Thermodynamics; Beaches; Erosion; Recovery; Storms; Beach Recoveries; Changing Climate; Equilibrium Modeling; Shoreline Evolutions; South China Sea; Storminess; Viet Nam; Winter Monsoon; Hurricanes; Beach Erosion; Beach Profile; Climate Conditions; Equilibrium; Extreme Event; Monsoon; Numerical Model; Seasonality; Shoreline; Shoreline Change; Storm; Typhoon; Winter; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Beaches; Erosion; Recovery; Storms; Beach recoveries; Changing climate; Equilibrium modeling; Shoreline evolutions; South China sea; Storminess; Viet Nam; Winter monsoon; Hurricanes; beach erosion; beach profile; climate conditions; equilibrium; extreme event; monsoon; numerical model; seasonality; shoreline; shoreline change; storm; typhoon; winter; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea","","","","Ashton, Andrew D., A discussion of the potential impacts of climate change on the shorelines of the Northeastern USA, Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 13, 7, pp. 719-743, (2008); Davidson, Mark A., A simple equilibrium model for predicting shoreline change, Coastal Engineering, 73, pp. 191-202, (2013); Cooper, J.

The main objective of this two-part study was to investigate the impacts of land use changes brought by the master plan on urban heat islands in Hanoi by 2030. This paper analyses the contributions of land use changes and global warming to the future increase in urban temperatures in Hanoi by the 2030s. Firstly, numerical simulations using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) were conducted for the present land use as well as the land use condition of the master plan under the same weather conditions to detect only the impact of land use changes. Secondly, WRF simulations were conducted for the land use condition of the master plan under the influence of global warming in the 2030s utilising the climate data projected by a Global Climate Model (GCM), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate Version 5 (MIROC5), via a direct dynamical downscaling method. In the 2030s, the average air temperature increase in existing urban areas was projected to be up to 2.1 °C, of which up to 1.5 and 0.6 °C are attributable to global warming and land use changes, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Cities; Dynamical Downscaling; Global Warming; Master Plan; Urban Heat Island; Atmospheric Temperature; Climate Models; Global Warming; Landforms; Population Statistics; Weather Forecasting; Average Air Temperature; Developing Cities; Dynamical Downscaling; Interdisciplinary Research; Master Plan; Rapid Population Growth; Urban Heat Island; Weather Research And Forecasting; Land Use","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Global warming; Landforms; Population statistics; Weather forecasting; Average air temperature; Developing cities; Dynamical downscaling; Interdisciplinary research; Master plan; Rapid population growth; Urban heat island; Weather research and forecasting; Land use","","","We sincerely appreciate the generous supports given by VIUP.

A qualitative comparative analysis method was used to determine which conditions or combinations of conditions led to or prevented a forest transition. Under the condition of public ownership with no private forest tenure or ownership of forest land, there was no instance of forest transition among the nine countries studied. Under the condition of non-liberal timber trade policies, there was no instance of forest transition in the countries studied. The results of this analysis suggest that for a forest transition to occur, the country should liberalize timber import and provide forest tenure to the private sector. Based on these results, we argue that in order for a forest transition to take place or for REDD + to be effective, the state should allow for private sector to participate in forest management and create market conditions that meet the demand for timber via trade policy alignment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Enabling Conditions; Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Commerce; Timber; Asia; Enabling Conditions; Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Forestry","Commerce; Timber; Asia; Enabling conditions; Forest policy; Forest transition; Qualitative comparative analysis; Forestry","","","This paper is based on a study conducted as a cooperative research within the project “Comparative Analyses of Transition to Sustainable Forest Management and Rehabilitation” carried out by APAFRI with financial support from the Asia-Pacific Network for Sustainable Forest Management and Rehabilitation (2011P6/6-APAFRI) and supported by the Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences of Seoul National University and Korea Forest Service's forest carbon sink graduate program.

The former puts more emphasis on local initiatives and the latter emphasizes the role of the government in forest transition. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between the two pathways. Based on a particular case study from Vietnam, we analyze historical forest transition data generated from remote sensing imageries and field research during the period from the 1950s until 2008. As a result, we found that after 1989 the forest area in the study area recovered and smallholder played an important role in forest transition. However, they did not engage in reforestation activities on their own. Rather, government support, technical expertise, a tree processing facility, traders and a research institute all supported reforestation. This broader institutional support from government and the private sector was important next to farmer driven reforestation to explain forest transition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Institutional Support; Smallholder; Vietnam; Agriculture; Reforestation; Remote Sensing; Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Institutional Support; Smallholder; Viet Nam; Forestry","Agriculture; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Forest policy; Forest transition; Institutional support; Smallholder; Viet Nam; Forestry","","","","A SIDA Evaluation Report, (1999); Socioeconomic Renovation in Viet Nam the Origin Evolution and Impact of Doi Moi, (2000); Doi Moi in the Mountains Land Use Changes and Farmers Livelihood Strategies in Bac Kan Province Vietnam, (2002); Castella, Jean Christophe, Impact of forestland allocation on land use in a mountainous province of Vietnam, Land Use Policy, 23, 2, pp. 147-160, (2006); Clement, Floriane, Afforestation and forestry land allocation in northern Vietnam: Analysing the gap between policy intentions and outcomes, Land Use Policy, 26, 2, pp. 458-470, (2009); Red Books Green Hills the Impact of Economic Reform on Restoration Ecology in the Midlands of Northern Vietnam, (1996); Gomiero, Tiziano, Vietnamese uplands: Environmental and socio-economic perspective of forest land allocation and deforestation process, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 2, 2, pp. 119-142, (2000); A Leap of Faith A Story of the Swedish Aid and Paper Production in Vietnam the Bai Bang Project 1969 1996, (1999); Mather, Alexander S., The forest transition, Area, 24, 4, pp. 367-379, (1992); Mather, Alexander S., Recent Asian forest transitions in relation to foresttransition theory, International Forestry Review, 9, 1, pp. 491-502, (2007)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13899341","","FPEOA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992225476"

In order to better understand the storm surge phenomenon, its nature and severity were analysed by means of a numerical simulation and a field survey. Unlike most other tropical cyclones that weaken before they hit land, Haiyan struck Leyte Island at near peak strength, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 160 knots, the strongest in the recorded history of the Western North Pacific. Haiyan approached very quickly with a forward speed of 41 km/h towards Leyte, which was also the fastest among typhoons with similar intensities. As a result of these extreme gusts and the exceptionally low central pressure of the typhoon (895 hPa), Haiyan caused the largest storm surge in the recorded history of the Philippines. Numerical simulations show that the maximum storm surges occurred in Leyte Island and Samar Island. A storm surge field survey conducted by the authors corroborated this, with maximum inundation height of 7 m recorded in Tacloban, located at the northern end of Leyte Gulf. The simulation results also corroborate the fact that water levels at some locations first lowered and then rapidly began to increase after an hour. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Field Survey; Numerical Simulation; Philippines; Storm Surge; Typhoon Haiyan (yolanda); Typhoon Track Analysis; Field Survey; Numerical Model; Simulation; Storm Surge; Tropical Cyclone; Typhoon Haiyan 2013; Water Level; Wind Velocity; Eastern Visayas; Leyte [(isl) Visayas]; Leyte [(prv) Eastern Visayas]; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (north); Philippines; Samar; Tacloban; Visayas","field survey; numerical model; simulation; storm surge; tropical cyclone; Typhoon Haiyan 2013; water level; wind velocity; Eastern Visayas; Leyte [(ISL) Visayas]; Leyte [(PRV) Eastern Visayas]; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Philippines; Samar; Tacloban; Visayas","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the other team members and the NHK team that accompanied the survey group: K.

However, the rapid growth of urban areas exerts effects on climate, biodiversity, hydrology, and natural ecosystems worldwide. Therefore, regular and up-to-date information related to urban extent is necessary to monitor the impacts of urban areas at local, regional, and potentially global scales. This study presents a new urban map of Eurasia at 500 m resolution using multi-source geospatial data, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data of 2013, population density of 2012, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime lights of 2012, and constructed Impervious Surface Area (ISA) data of 2010. The Eurasian urban map was created using the threshold method for these data, combined with references of fine resolution Landsat and Google Earth imagery. The resultant map was compared with nine global urban maps and was validated using random sampling method. Results of the accuracy assessment showed high overall accuracy of the new urban map of 94%.

Dr. Nishimura initiated a study of the shipwreck material, but it was cut short by his sudden demise. A group of Japanese scholars continued the project in co-operation with the Institute of Archaeology (Vietnam). Since remnants of the shipwreck were pillaged and their archaeological contexts were not recorded, this initial study is limited to a comparative assessment of the recovered items, including wooden timbers from the hull and Chinese ceramics. It is also a case study for addressing the ethical issues of raising shipwreck remains in Vietnam for commercial purposes without conducting scientific surveys. The study indicates that the ship timbers came from an eighth-ninth century Southeast Asian ship, and that the Chinese ceramics can be assigned to the Tang Dynasty.

However, evidence on this direct impact at a global scale is limited, mainly due to issues in modelling and projecting complex and highly heterogeneous epidemiological relationships across different populations and climates. Methods: We collected observed daily time series of mean temperature and mortality counts for all causes or non-external causes only, in periods ranging from Jan 1, 1984, to Dec 31, 2015, from various locations across the globe through the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network. We estimated temperature–mortality relationships through a two-stage time series design. We generated current and future daily mean temperature series under four scenarios of climate change, determined by varying trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions, using five general circulation models. We projected excess mortality for cold and heat and their net change in 1990–2099 under each scenario of climate change, assuming no adaptation or population changes. Findings: Our dataset comprised 451 locations in 23 countries across nine regions of the world, including 85 879 895 deaths. Results indicate, on average, a net increase in temperature-related excess mortality under high-emission scenarios, although with important geographical differences. In temperate areas such as northern Europe, east Asia, and Australia, the less intense warming and large decrease in cold-related excess would induce a null or marginally negative net effect, with the net change in 2090–99 compared with 2010–19 ranging from −1·2% (empirical 95% CI −3·6 to 1·4) in Australia to −0·1% (−2·1 to 1·6) in east Asia under the highest emission scenario, although the decreasing trends would reverse during the course of the century. Conversely, warmer regions, such as the central and southern parts of America or Europe, and especially southeast Asia, would experience a sharp surge in heat-related impacts and extremely large net increases, with the net change at the end of the century ranging from 3·0% (−3·0 to 9·3) in Central America to 12·7% (−4·7 to 28·1) in southeast Asia under the highest emission scenario. Most of the health effects directly due to temperature increase could be avoided under scenarios involving mitigation strategies to limit emissions and further warming of the planet. Interpretation: This study shows the negative health impacts of climate change that, under high-emission scenarios, would disproportionately affect warmer and poorer regions of the world. Comparison with lower emission scenarios emphasises the importance of mitigation policies for limiting global warming and reducing the associated health risks.

Although all species were present in urban habitats, their occurrence, alpha diversity, and abundance were lower there compared with suburban areas or rice paddies. Individual species showed differential responses to habitat characteristics, and species richness was positively associated with presence of aquatic vegetation, presence of shallow areas, amount of surrounding vegetated uplands, and banks constructed of soil rather than concrete or rock. Urbanization tended to decrease all of these associated features. During the 10months of this study, at least 14% of the surveyed urban and suburban water bodies were altered in ways that greatly or entirely reduced amphibian breeding. However, simple habitat enhancements could be beneficial; half of the species we found bred in concrete fountains that included potted ornamental plants and that were located inmanicured parks in the center of Ho Chi Minh City. Although continued urbanization threatens native amphibians, cities are able to supportmany species where key habitat features are present. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anuran; Aquatic; Asia; Novel Habitat; Tropics","","","","This research was partially supported by National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship grant #1148897 to K.A.H. and Project VAST.CTG.03/16-17 funding to T.T.N.

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of project organizational culture on the performance of construction projects. A total of 199 completed construction projects in Vietnam with specific data gathering through questionnaires were analyzed. The findings reveal that contractor commitment to contract agreements is the most significant cultural factor affecting project performance. Goal alignment and reliance, contractor commitment, and worker orientation (i.e., commitment to workers) contribute to improved overall performance and participant satisfaction. Contractor commitment and cooperative orientation enhance labor productivity, whereas goal alignment and trust and contractor commitment ensure learning performance (i.e., learning from experience).

Multiple geomorphic factors such as elevation, slope, topographic wetness index and distance from the river channel impact on flood J susceptibility. Determining the effect of each factor and integration of their influence on flood hazard zonation has become an essential need in flood management. This study attempts to develop a hierarchical model for flood hazard zonation in the coastal lowland of Central Vietnam by using a multi-parametric approach. Five factors including elevation based flood inundation, distance from the river channel, land use, slope and topographic wetness index have been taken into consideration for developing flood hazard zonation. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was applied to assign weights according to the pair-wise comparisons of the parameters. These weights were used for calculation of Flood Hazard Index which was then evaluated and classified into four zones of flood hazard susceptibility. The result of flood hazard zonation was compared with field survey flood pillar points and flood inundation map extracted from ALOS PALSAR image in 2007 for validation. The comparison with field flood pillars indicated good correspondence with demarcated zones and estimated depth. Further, nearly 80 percent of inundated areas observed in ALOS PALSAR data fall in the high and very high flood hazard zones. The excellent agreement between flood hazard zonation map and observed inundation demonstrate the effectiveness AHP based method in flood hazard assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytical Hierarchy Process; Coastal Zone; Flooding; Hazard Assessment; Hazard Management; Lowland Environment; Natural Hazard; Parameterization; Zonation; Viet Nam","analytical hierarchy process; coastal zone; flooding; hazard assessment; hazard management; lowland environment; natural hazard; parameterization; zonation; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported by the Japanese Government Scholarship (Monbukagakusho) under Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.

Our analysis of inundation patterns projects that the duration of inundation at an important road in the city will continue to rise from the current total of 72 inundated days per year to 270 days by 2030 and 365 days by 2050. This is attributed to the combined influence of sea-level rise and land subsidence, which causes relative water level rises at a rate of 22.3 mm·yr-1. People in the Mekong Delta have traditionally lived with floods, and thus there is certain resilience among residents in coping with small floods. At present, daily maximum inundation depth, which is generally shallower than 10 cm on the road, seems to be still manageable; however, our analysis indicates that this will start drastically increasing in the coming decades and reach an average depth of 70 cm by 2050. Effective and well-planned actions to mitigate the effects of land subsidence and sea-level rise are urgently required, otherwise, local inhabitants will encounter an unmanageable increase in inundation depth and duration in the coming decades. This study, which considers both sea-level rise and land subsidence, suggests that inundation depth and duration are projected to rise much faster than those indicated by previous studies, which only consider sea-level rise. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flood; Land Subsidence; Mekong Delta; River Discharge; Sea-level Rise (slr); Tide; Action Plan; Disaster Management; Flood; Ocean Tide; River Discharge; Sea Level Change; Subsidence; Can Tho; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","action plan; disaster management; flood; ocean tide; river discharge; sea level change; subsidence; Can Tho; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","","Greater Mekong and Climate Change Biodiversity Ecosystem Services and Development at Risk, (2009); Bull Faculty Sci Univ Ryukyus, (2007); Impact of Sea Level Rise on Developing Countries A Comparative Analysis, (2007); Wassmann, Reiner, Sea level rise affecting the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Water elevation in the flood season and implications for rice production, Climatic Change, 66, 1-2, pp. 89-107, (2004); Rapid Assessment of the Extent and Impact of Sea Level Rise in Viet Nam, (2008); Nerem, R.

This work describes the design and implementation of an assistance system for a personal mobility vehicle using the concept of personal space (PS), and clarifies the influence of the PMV equipped with the assistance system on surrounding pedestrians. The proposed assistance system detects nearby pedestrians and notifies the driver the invasion of the PMV. The experiment was conducted under different conditions of pedestrian density, and questionnaires were used to evaluate the feelings of PMV drivers and pedestrians such as discomfort and fear. The experimental results showed that the assistance system for the PMV was very effective at low pedestrian densities. The discomfort levels of pedestrians and drivers, when the PMV was equipped with the assistance system, were lower than those for the case of the PMV without assistance system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assistance System; Experimental Evaluation; Pedestrians; Personal Mobility Vehicle; Personal Space","","","","","Proceedings of 13th Asia Pacific Vibration Conference, (2025); Sawatzky, Bonita J., The Segway Personal Transporter as an Alternative Mobility Device for People With Disabilities: A Pilot Study, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 88, 11, pp. 1423-1428, (2007); Ulrich, Karl T., Estimating the technology frontier for personal electric vehicles, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 13, 5-6, pp. 448-462, (2005); Yoopt Your Personal Transporter; Leader in Personal Green Transportation; Butler, John Travis, Psychological effects of behavior patterns of a mobile personal robot, Autonomous Robots, 10, 2, pp. 185-202, (2001); Walters, Michael L., The influence of subjects' personality traits on personal spatial zones in a human-robot interaction experiment, 2005, pp. 347-352, (2005); Nakagawa, Chihiro, Evaluation of personal space for pedestrians encountering personal mobility vehicles, (2013); First International Symposium on Future Active Safety Technology Toward Zero Traffic Accident, (2011); Nakagawa, Chihiro, Influence of the size of a personal mobility vehicle on the affinity with a pedestrian, 1, pp. 795-802, (2012)","","American Scientific Publishers","","","","","","19366612; 19367317","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989167881"

By modelling a global social contract, I mean the formulation of a social contract using two sets of data: one is global citizens' preferences about values and norms while the other is sovereign states' participation in multilateral treaties. Both Rousseau and Locke formulate their versions of social contract theories in the national context of eighteenth-century Europe. This paper tries my hands on extending their theories to the global context. This paper attempts to link empirically the relationship between global citizens' preferences as gauged by the World Values Survey and sovereign states' participation in 120 multilateral treaties deposited to the United Nations. To see the link between citizens and treaties (quasi-legislative outcomes, sort of), dimensional similarities of the cosmos of citizens' preference and the cosmos of sovereign states' willingness to join multilateral treaties are examined. Once done, all the sovereign states are located in each of the two cosmoses, citizens and states, and the correlation coefficients between them are measured. Based on these empirical results, the nature of the global quasi-legislative process is clarified.

Simulations incorporate different land use/cover and anthropogenic heat release data sets for the current and future periods, while the boundary condition was fixed in the current time to detect only the impact of urbanization. Furthermore, human thermal comfort due to changes in the thermal environment was examined by analyzing the temperature-humidity index. Simulated results show that the increase in the surface air temperature is approximately 0.22 °C in the preexisting urbanized area and approximately 0.41 °C in new highly urbanized areas. The main factor in these changes is conversion from agricultural or grassland to urban structures, which results in increased sensible heating and decreased latent heating. Simulated results also show that despite the increase in air temperature, there is no significant change in thermal comfort. This is because human comfort is not only determined by temperature alone, but also by relative humidity. Urbanization increases temperatures, but decreases evaporation, which then decreases the relative humidity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamical Downscaling; Future Urbanization; Greater Ho Chi Minh City; Human Thermal Comfort; Tropical Developing Megacity; Weather Research And Forecasting Model","","","","We thank Dr. Vo Le Phu and Dr. Tran Thi Van for their useful help in collecting the data.

In yaw-pitch-roll order (ZYX convention) Euler angles, roll and pitch are commonly used to represent the tilt of an object. Measuring these angles with an analog accelerometer is a good choice if we can suppress electromagnetic interference. However, the existing suppression methods generally require additional hardware or software. In another approach, one angle can be measured with less effect of interference if sensor orientation and calculation formulas are changed; the preliminary idea has been previously introduced. This paper presents a more optimized design which allows computing the roll angle without any disturbance of interference. The immunity is due to the calculation formulas using differential voltages among sensor outputs. Hence, an advantage of the differential signaling technique is taken within the single-ended system. Both simulations and experiments have confirmed the notable efficiency: noise power was reduced 230 times; angle errors were reduced 5-22.5 times, without any additional hardware and software. This study could be useful for systems which require high speed and high resolution with minimum resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accelerometers; Electromagnetic Pulse; Hardware; Reconfigurable Hardware; Calculation Formula; Differential Signaling; Differential Voltage; Hardware And Software; Interference Cancellation; Interference Reduction; Orientation Measurements; Single-ended Systems; Interference Suppression","Accelerometers; Electromagnetic pulse; Hardware; Reconfigurable hardware; Calculation formula; Differential signaling; Differential voltage; Hardware and software; Interference cancellation; Interference reduction; Orientation measurements; Single-ended systems; Interference suppression","","","","Tilt Sensing Using A Three Axis Accelerometer, (2013); Łuczak, Sergiusz, Sensing tilt with MEMS accelerometers, IEEE Sensors Journal, 6, 6, pp. 1669-1675, (2006); Luinge, Henk J., Inclination Measurement of Human Movement Using a 3-D Accelerometer with Autocalibration, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 12, 1, pp. 112-121, (2004); Application Note An3182 Stmicroelectronics, (2010); Duke, Eugene L., Derivation and definition of a linear aircraft model, 1207, (1988); Warren, Alexander, Horizon stabilized-dynamic view expansion for robotic assisted surgery (HS-DVE), International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery, 7, 2, pp. 281-288, (2012); Substrate Bounce in Mixed Mode Cmos Ics Analog Circuit Design Volt Electronics Mixed Mode Systems Low Noise and RF Power Amplifiers for Telecommunication, (1999); Constandinou, Timothy G., Micropower arcsine circuit for tilt processing, Electronics Letters, 44, 23, pp. 1336-1338, (2008); Richelli, Anna, EMI susceptibility issue in analog front-end for sensor applications, Journal of Sensors, 2016, (2016); Electronic Noise and Interfering Signals Principles and Applications, (2005)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","11th France-Japan and 9th Europe-Asia Congress on Mechatronics, MECATRONICS 2016 / 17th International Conference on Research and Education in Mechatronics, REM 2016","","Compiegne","","","9781509017874","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986205306"

However, these organisations are sometimes criticised for their support of those in power. Within this context, critics refer to the fact that many COs have, for example, authoritarian intra-organisational structures. This characteristic clearly limits their potential to be supporters of democratisation processes. In this paper, we proceed from the assumption that Vietnamese COs can be both supporters of democracy and organisations that help to maintain authoritarian rule; they can sometimes even be both at the same time. COs are “polyvalent” (Kößler). More concretely, what COs are and which role(s) they play in the political system is mainly but not exclusively dependent on the impact the state has on them, and is at the same time dependent on the effects that those organisations have on the state. The results from an empirical survey, supported by the German Research Council (2013-2016) and carried out as a co-operation between the Institute of Asian Studies/GIGA Hamburg and the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences, suggest the following: ▪ Most Vietnamese COs are hierarchically structured, if not organised in an authoritarian way. They are not “schools of democracy”, in the sense of Tocqueville. ▪ Most Vietnamese COs that have engaged in the welfare provision sector, either willingly or unwillingly, have helped to foster the foundations of authoritarianism. ▪ In the field of economic policies, the COs invited by the state to participate in and contribute to the formulation of policies do help, overall, to secure existing power structures, even though these organisations also help change various economic policies and even though their activities produce some democracy-promoting effects. ▪ In the policy field of gender equality, women’s rights, and rights of sexual minorities, the mass organisation Vietnam Women’s Union supports the state’s respective discourse. Some NGOs active in this policy field are doing both: They support and criticise the state’s discourse on gender norms and the rights of sexual minorities. In the conclusion, we answer the question of which Vietnamese COs can be seen as supporters of further democratisation and which can be classified as obstacles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Authoritarianism; Civic Organisations; Democratization; Vietnam","","","","","Bebbington, Anthony J., Introduction: Can NGOs Make a Difference?

The results of a survey on 650 tourists suggest that international visitors to the Ha Long Bay region have higher standards and are more critical in their evaluation of services than domestic visitors when judging this destination. Destination image is a common factor determining the level of satisfaction of both groups. Basic and augmented services were found to influence international visitors’ future intention toward the destination.

In the context of commuting, neighborhood and travel preferences may induce self-selection effects in choices about residential location, work location, and commuting mode. Presumably, such self-selection effects may vary across different job markets. To date, however, no study has been done in developing countries. Therefore, this study aims to fill this research gap by using data collected in Hanoi, Vietnam. A joint model with the above three choices is built by incorporating self-selection effects, where effects of land use attributes are emphasized. Choices of labor-intensive workers (11,344) and knowledge-intensive workers (12,360) are compared. The statistical significance of multiple self-selection effects is confirmed, which suggests that the joint estimation of the above three choices is a useful approach. As for the magnitude of influence of self-selection effects, self-selection seems to be more influential in knowledge-intensive workers' residential location and work location choices. As for land use attributes, different types of households, and labor-intensive and knowledge-intensive workers show different responses to different types of land in location choices (especially the work location choice). Effects of land use diversity and population density on the commuting mode choice are mixed. Additionally, the centralization of knowledge-intensive employment and decentralization of labor-intensive employment are captured. These findings may be useful for city planners in Hanoi in designing land use patterns in the future in order to keep knowledge-intensive workers working and living close together. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commuting Mode; Hanoi; Land Use; Residential Location; Self-selection; Work Location; Commuting; Developing World; Future Prospect; Land Use; Land Use Planning; Preference Behavior; Residential Location; Spatial Analysis; Transportation Mode; Travel Behavior; Workplace; Hanoi; Viet Nam","commuting; developing world; future prospect; land use; land use planning; preference behavior; residential location; spatial analysis; transportation mode; travel behavior; workplace; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","","Location and Land Use, (1964); Bhat, Chandra R., A comprehensive analysis of built environment characteristics on household residential choice and auto ownership levels, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 41, 5, pp. 506-526, (2007); Yu, Biying, Analysis of the residential location choice and household energy consumption behavior by incorporating multiple self-selection effects, Energy Policy, 46, pp. 319-334, (2012); Sprawl A Compact History, (2005); Cao, Jason (Jason), Residential self-selection in the relationships between the built environment and travel behavior: Introduction to the special issue, Journal of Transport and Land Use, 7, 3, pp. 1-3, (2014); Cao, Jason (Jason), Examining the impacts of residential self-selection on travel behaviour: A focus on empirical findings, Transport Reviews, 29, 3, pp. 359-395, (2009); Cervero, Robert B., Built environments and mode choice: Toward a normative framework, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 7, 4, pp. 265-284, (2002); Cervero, Robert B., Linking urban transport and land use in developing countries, Journal of Transport and Land Use, 6, 1, pp. 7-24, (2013); Cervero, Robert B., Travel demand and the 3Ds: Density, diversity, and design, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 2, 3, pp. 199-219, (1997); Chikarashi, Makoto, Identifying variations and co-variations in discrete choice models, Transportation, 38, 6, pp. 993-1016, (2011)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09666923","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973487334"

On the other hand, local properties of the microclimate around the human body can also significantly affect the interaction between the body and the surrounding environment by way of local flow and heat transfer characteristics close to the body. Breathing is one of the most essential activities in our lives, and the basic functions of breathing include exchanging gases (supplying oxygen from ambient air and removing carbon dioxide from the blood) and exchanging heat and moisture (sensible and latent heat). As a consequence, human beings experience lifelong interaction with indoor environments via inhalation. In this study, two types of three-dimensional respiratory tract models were developed using computed tomography data of a healthy human males. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to analyze the airflow and temperature distributions inside respiratory tract models under various breathing conditions. We used low-Reynolds-number-type k-ε model to predict airflow in the airway models. The flow pattern inside the viscous sub-layer and convective heat flux on the airway tissue surfaces and convective heat transfer coefficients were analyzed. Through this study, the numerical errors were successfully identical, so this discrepancy of two airway models were assumed due to the differences in airway geometries and reflected individual specificity.

Then firstly, the effects of cyclic shear direction on the pore water pressure accumulation and secondly, the relationships between the plasticity index of clay and the pore water pressure accumulated during cyclic shear were investigated. In conclusion, it is clarified that when a saturated clay is subjected to uni-directional or multi-directional cyclic simple shear under the undrained condition, the pore water pressure induced by multi-directional cyclic shear increases considerably larger than those generated by the uni-directional one and such a tendency is seen in clays with a wide range of the plasticity indices. The plasticity index of clayey soil significantly affects the pore water pressure generation and the higher the plasticity index of soil, the slower the rate of pore water pressure accumulation which leads to the smaller pore water pressure, irrespective of cyclic shearing conditions. A pore water pressure model was developed by incorporating the plasticity index as an experimental constant and the applicability of this model was confirmed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clay; Cyclic Shear; Plasticity Index; Pore Water Pressure; Undrained","","","","A part of this study is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant number 105.99-2014.04 and the experimental works were also supported by the students who graduated Yamaguchi University.

The second phase will classify arguments and explicit connectives into one of thirteen types of senses by using the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) and Random Forest classifiers with a set of features extracted from arguments and connective along with a set of given resources. The evaluation results of the whole system on the development, test and blind data set are 29.65%, 24.67% and 20.37% in terms of F1 scores.

Different from single action detection, event detection requires a richer level of semantic information from video. In order to overcome this challenge, existing solutions often represent videos using high level features such as concepts. However, concept-based representation can be confusing because it does not encode the relationship between concepts. This issue can be addressed by exploiting the co-occurrences of the concepts, however, it often leads to a very huge number of possible combinations. In this paper, we propose a new approach to obtain the relationship between concepts by exploiting the syntactic dependencies between words in the image captions. The main advantage of this approach is that it significantly reduces the number of informative combinations between concepts. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effectiveness of using the new dependency representation for event detection on two large-scale TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2013 and 2014 datasets. Experimental results show that i) Dependency features are more discriminative than concept-based features, ii) Dependency features can be combined with our current event detection system to further improve the performance. For instance, the relative improvement can be as far as 8.6% on the MEDTEST14 10Ex setting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Event Detection; High-level Features; Multimedia Event Detections; Multimedia Retrieval; Relationship Between Concepts; Semantic Information; Syntactic Dependencies; Video Event Detections; Image Retrieval","Computational linguistics; Semantics; Event detection; High-level features; Multimedia event detections; Multimedia Retrieval; Relationship between concepts; Semantic information; Syntactic dependencies; Video event detections; Image retrieval","","","This research was partially supported by JST, PRESTO.","Assari, Shayan Modiri, Video classification using semantic concept co-occurrences, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2529-2536, (2014); Borth, Damian, Large-scale visual sentiment ontology and detectors using adjective noun pairs, pp. 223-232, (2013); Can, Ethem F., Modeling concept dependencies for event detection, pp. 289-296, (2014); Chang, Chihchung, LIBSVM: A Library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, 3, (2011); Chen, Jiawei, Event-driven semantic concept discovery by exploiting weakly tagged internet images, pp. 1-8, (2014); Davidson, James, The YouTube video recommendation system, pp. 293-296, (2010); Deng, Jia, ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database, pp. 248-255, (2009); Habibian, Amirhossein, Recommendations for video event recognition using concept vocabularies, pp. 89-96, (2013); Habibian, Amirhossein, Videostory: A new multimedia embedding for few-example recognition and translation of events, pp. 17-26, (2014); Habibian, Amirhossein, Composite concept discovery for zero-shot video event detection, pp. 17-24, (2014)","","Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL Anthology","","26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING 2016","","Osaka","136517","","9784879747020","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054982152"

In general, the QoE of a streaming session is affected by three key factors, namely initial delay, varying perceptual quality, and interruptions. In this paper, in order to investigate the impacts of quality variations and interruptions on the QoE of a session, we propose to use histograms, which represent the frequency distributions of these recurrent factors in a session. The QoE of a session is modeled by the statistics of the recurrent factors and the impact of initial delay. Evaluation results show that the proposed model has a high prediction performance. Especially, the proposed model provides insights into the impacts of different influence factors, thus leading to suggestions to improve the quality of streaming video. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Streaming; Histogram; Subjective Test; Video Quality Model; Graphic Methods; Quality Control; Subjective Testing; Adaptive Streaming; Frequency Distributions; Histogram; Perceptual Quality; Prediction Performance; Quality Of Experience (qoe); Streaming Sessions; Video Quality; Quality Of Service","Graphic methods; Quality control; Subjective testing; Adaptive streaming; Frequency distributions; Histogram; Perceptual quality; Prediction performance; Quality of experience (QoE); Streaming sessions; Video quality; Quality of service","","","","Cong-Thang, Truong, Adaptive streaming of audiovisual content using MPEG DASH, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 58, 1, pp. 78-85, (2012); IFIP IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, (2013); Zegarra Rodríguez, Demóstenes Zegarra, The impact of video-quality-level switching on user quality of experience in dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP, Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2014, 1, (2014); Guo, Zhili, Assessing the visual effect of non-periodic temporal variation of quantization stepsize in compressed video, Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, 2015-December, pp. 3121-3125, (2015); Shen, Yun, A method of QoE evaluation for adaptive streaming based on bitrate distribution, pp. 551-556, (2014); Liu, Yao, Deriving and Validating User Experience Model for DASH Video Streaming, IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting, 61, 4, pp. 651-665, (2015); Tran, Huyen T.T., A novel quality model for HTTP adaptive streaming, pp. 423-428, (2016); Quality of Multimedia Experience, (2012); Singh, Kamal Deep, Quality of experience estimation for adaptive HTTP/TCP video streaming using H.264/AVC, pp. 127-131, (2012); IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops, GC Wkshps 2016","","Washington; DC","126433","","9781509024827","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015963365"

In various approaches of sentence alignment, length-and-word-based methods which are based on sentence length and word correspondences have been shown to be the most effective. Nevertheless a drawback of using bilingual dictionaries trained by IBM Models in length-and-word-based methods is the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV). We propose using word similarity learned from monolingual corpora to overcome the problem. Experimental results showed that our method can reduce the OOV ratio and achieve a better performance than some other lengthand- word-based methods. This implies that using word similarity learned from monolingual data may help to deal with OOV problem in sentence alignment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Monolingual Data; Out-ofvocabulary; Sentence Alignment; Word Similarity; Alignment; Computer Aided Language Translation; Bilingual Corpora; Bilingual Dictionary; Monolingual Data; Out-ofvocabulary; Sentence Alignment; Sentence Length; Statistical Machine Translation; Word Similarity; Natural Language Processing Systems","Alignment; Computer aided language translation; Bilingual corpora; Bilingual dictionary; Monolingual data; Out-ofvocabulary; Sentence alignment; Sentence length; Statistical machine translation; Word similarity; Natural language processing systems","","","","Brown, Peter F., Aligning sentences in parallel corpora, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1991-June, pp. 169-176, (1991); Computational Linguistics, (1993); Cettolo, Mauro, WIT3: Web inventory of transcribed and translated talks, pp. 261-268, (2012); Chen, Stanley F., Aligning sentences in bilingual corpora using lexical information, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1993-June, pp. 9-16, (1993); Computational Linguistics, (1993); Computational Linguistics, (1993); Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2016); Ma, Xiaoyi, Champollion: A robust parallel text sentence aligner, pp. 489-492, (2006); Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, (1996); Mikolov, Tomáš, Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space, (2013)","Park, J.C.; Chung, J.-W.","Institute for the Study of Language and Information leri@khu.ac.kr","","30th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, PACLIC 2016","","Seoul; Kyung Hee University","126565","","9788968174285","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015839847"

However, hyperspectral remote sensing resources are limited both in temporal and spatial coverage. Therefore, simulation of hyperspectral imagery from multispectral imagery with a small number of bands must be one of innovative topics. Based on this background, we have recently developed a method, Pseudo-Hyperspectral Image Synthesis Algorithm (PHISA), to transform Landsat imagery into hyperspectral imagery using the correlation of reflectance at the corresponding bands between Landsat and EO-1 Hyperion data. This study extends PHISA to simulate pseudo-hyperspectral imagery from EO-1 ALI imagery. The pseudo-hyperspectral imagery has the same number of bands as that of high-quality Hyperion bands and the same swath width as ALI scene. The hyperspectral reflectance data simulated from the ALI data show stronger correlation with the original Hyperion data than the one simulated from Landsat data. This high correlation originates from the concurrent observation by the ALI and Hyperion sensors that are on-board the same satellite. The accuracy of simulation results are verified by a statistical analysis and a surface mineral mapping. With a combination of the advantages of both ALI and Hyperion image types, the pseudo-hyperspectral imagery is proved to be useful for detailed identification of minerals for the areas outside the Hyperion coverage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ali; Hyperion; Hyperspectral Data; Multiple Analysis; Spectral Reconstruction; Algorithms; Image Processing; Reflection; Spectral Resolution; Spectroscopy; High Spectral Resolution; Hyperion; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral Reflectance; Hyperspectral Remote Sensing; Multiple Analysis; Multispectral Remote Sensing; Spectral Reconstruction; Remote Sensing","Algorithms; Image processing; Reflection; Spectral resolution; Spectroscopy; High spectral resolution; Hyperion; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral reflectance; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Multiple analysis; Multispectral remote sensing; Spectral reconstruction; Remote sensing","","","We are grateful to USGS and NASA for providing us with raw EO-1 Hyperion, ALI, Landsat 7 ETM+ and AVIRIS images.","Chen, Fang, Using low-spectral-resolution images to acquire simulated hyperspectral images, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 29, 10, pp. 2963-2980, (2008); Datt, Bisun, Preprocessing EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral data to support the application of agricultural indexes, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 41, 6 PART I, pp. 1246-1259, (2003); Goodenough, David George, Processing Hyperion and ALI for forest classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 41, 6 PART I, pp. 1321-1331, (2003); Hoang, Nguyen Tien, Development of Bayesian-based transformation method of Landsat imagery into pseudo-hyperspectral imagery, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9643, (2015); Kruse, Fred A., Comparison of airborne hyperspectral data and EO-1 Hyperion for mineral mapping, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 41, 6 PART I, pp. 1388-1400, (2003); Liu, Bo, Simulation of EO-1 Hyperion Data from ALI Multispectral Data Based on the Spectral Reconstruction Approach, Sensors, 9, 4, pp. 3090-3108, (2009); R News, (2005); Swayze, Gregg A., Mapping advanced argillic alteration at Cuprite, Nevada, using imaging spectroscopy, Economic Geology, 109, 5, pp. 1179-1221, (2014)","Yoshimura, M.; Ben-Dor, E.; Zagajewski, B.; Blaschke, T.; Potuckova, M.; Zhang, J.; Brovelli, M.A.; Halounova, L.; Sunar, F.; Patkova, L.; Soergel, U.; Bareth, G.; Kaasalainen, S.; Sorgel, U.; Smit, J.; Crosetto, M.; Osmanoglu, B.; Crespi, M.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","23rd International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences Congress, ISPRS 2016","","Prague","122460","16821750","9781629935126; 9781629934297; 9781629935201","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979527215"

Vietnam is a lower middle income country with hearing health care in its early stages of development. This study examined the situation (degree, types, and causes) of hearing impairment, the effects of age and gender on hearing impairment, and the age of identification and its relationship with degree of hearing impairment, in a sample of Vietnamese children with hearing loss. Method: Sixty-nine participants aged from 20 to 129 months with prelingual-onset hearing loss were assessed during Global Foundation For Children With Hearing Loss international partnership activities. Data on hearing assessment findings, including case history and pure-tone audiometric outcomes, were analyzed. Results: Results showed that the hearing loss of participants ranged from moderate to profound levels (mean pure-tone average in better ear = 95.9 dB HL, range = 51.7-125.0 dB, SD = 17.37). Sensorineural pathologies accounted for 80% of identified hearing loss. Maternal rubella was the most commonly identified cause of hearing loss, with this disease reported as confirmed in 32% of children and suspected in another 13% of the participants. Genetic factors were suspected in at least 13% of children. Age and gender showed no statistically significant associations with degree of hearing impairment. The average age of identification was 23.2 months (range = 2-68 months, SD = 12.82) and a greater proportion (65%) of children with profound hearing loss than those with milder degrees of hearing loss were noted. Conclusion: To reduce the prevalence of childhood hearing loss and its adverse long-term effects, improved immunization programs against infectious diseases, further development of universal newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs, and greater access to hearing technology in Vietnam are highly recommended. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deafness; Early Intervention; Hearing Loss; Hearing Screening; Prevalence; Rubella; Vietnam","","","","","Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media Burden of Illness and Management Options, (2004); Balle, Viggo Hulthin, Prevalence of chronic otitis media in a randomly selected population from two communes in southern Vietnam, Acta Oto-Laryngologica, Supplement, 543, pp. 51-53, (2000); Clark, J.

The Online Cultural Exchange Program (OCEP), currently hosted by the University of Miyazaki (Japan) has been functioning successfully since 2007 (see Araki, Shirasaka, and Larson, 2008), gradually expanding its scope from nursing students alone to include engineering and agriculture majors, consisting largely of online written personal introductions and light-hearted cultural exchanges. However, recent planned expansions of the program into the Faculty of Medicine between the host university in Japan and a new participant in Vietnam has demanded a re-evaluation of what is expected from the program with regard to its utility for medical students. In order to develop a focus suited to the academic and professional needs of medical students in both the hosting university (Miyazaki, Japan) and the new Vietnamese participant (Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy) a pre-program survey was designed by the authors in order to gauge medical students' expectations, specific interests, preferences, anxieties, and abilities to fruitfully participate in such a program. In this paper, some salient results of these surveys are presented, along with the implications of moving the program towards a more professional and academic focus, and cultural factors that may affect participant expectations and potential outcomes.

In this work, we examine a fossil mandible of the raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides, which was recovered from the bed of the Penghu channel, and compare this with extant raccoon dog subspecies in East Asia. Two-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of the lower first molar of the Penghu specimen demonstrates that continental and Japanese populations were clearly separated. This indicates that amongst continental populations, the Penghu specimen has a shape intermediate between extant Chinese and Korean populations. Results indicate that the Penghu raccoon dog is phylogenetically closer to the extant continental raccoon dog, rather than those of Japan, and that the Chinese and Korean populations were not greatly separated at that time. When considering the fact that recent phylogenetic and population genetic studies report that the Korean raccoon dog population separated from other continental populations at the last glacial maximum, we can state that the Penghu fauna is at least 20000 years old. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geometric Morphometrics; Lower First Molar; Middle/late Pleistocene; Penghu Fauna","","","","","Argant, Alain, The Carnivores of the late Pliocene site of Saint-Vallier (Drôme, France), Geobios, 37, SUPPL. 1, pp. S133-S182, (2004); Asahara, Masakazu, Shape variation in the skull and lower carnassial in a wild population of raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), Zoological Science, 30, 3, pp. 205-210, (2013); Chang, Chunhsiang, The first archaic Homo from Taiwan, Nature Communications, 6, (2015); Dong, Wei, The large mammals from Tuozidong (eastern China) and the Early Pleistocene environmental availability for early human settlements, Quaternary International, 295, pp. 73-82, (2013); Haba, C., Morphological variation of the Japanese raccoon dog: Implications for geographical isolation and environmental adaptation, Journal of Zoology, 274, 3, pp. 239-247, (2008); Handbook of Chinese Vertebrate Fossils, (1979); Annual of Taiwan Museum, (1997); Journal of the National Taiwan Museum, (2008); Fossil Faunas of Penghu Islands, (1993); Huang, Renyi, Morphology and geologic implications of Penghu Channel off south-west Taiwan, Terrestrial, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, 14, 4, pp. 469-485, (2003)","","Anthropological Society of Nippon g002jinrui-mng@ml.galileo.co.jp","","","","","","09187960; 13488570","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84950259969"

Unlike past researches which mainly focus on flooding due to river discharge from upstream or heavy precipitation, the present paper scrutinises the influence of ocean tides. The research reveals that ocean tides predominantly determine water elevation even in an upstream location such as Can Tho City, 80 km inland from the river mouth, and that the river flow causes tidal damping and effectively reduces the energy of the incoming tides. This tidal damping is especially pronounced during the rainy season. Analysis based on the water levels monitored by the Mekong River Commission revealed that the ground near the riverbank of Can Tho had experienced inundation for a total of 215 h between July 2009 and June 2010 (2.5% of the time over a 1-year period). Assuming three scenarios of sea-level rise of 20, 40, and 60cm, all within the range of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR4's projections, it was found that the duration of inundation will be prolonged from the present percentage of 2.5% to 6%, 13%, and 24% of the year, respectively. Furthermore, the field survey carried out by the authors shows that inundation reached up to a height of 47 cm above the roads of Can Tho downtown. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Lowlands; Risk Assessment; River; Climate Change; Flooding; Hazard Assessment; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change; Lowland Environment; Ocean Tide; Risk Assessment; River Discharge; River System; Sea Level Change; Urban Area; Can Tho; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","climate change; flooding; hazard assessment; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; lowland environment; ocean tide; risk assessment; river discharge; river system; sea level change; urban area; Can Tho; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","","Aerts, Jeroen C.J.H., Sensitivity of global river discharges under Holocene and future climate conditions, Geophysical Research Letters, 33, 19, (2006); undefined, (2009); Rapid Assessment of the Extent and Impact of Sea Level Rise in Viet Nam, (2008); Impact of Sea Level Rise on Developing Countries A Comparative Analysis, (2007); Esteban, Miguel, Increase in Port Downtime and Damage in Vietnam Due To a Potential Increase in Tropical Cyclone Intensity, Climate Change Management, pp. 101-125, (2012); FAO Statistics Div; undefined, (2011); Foreman, Michael G.G., Versatile harmonic tidal analysis: Improvements and applications, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 26, 4, pp. 806-817, (2009); Gorokhovich, Yuri A., Accuracy assessment of the processed SRTM-based elevation data by CGIAR using field data from USA and Thailand and its relation to the terrain characteristics, Remote Sensing of Environment, 104, 4, pp. 409-415, (2006); Impacts of Climate Change and Development on Mekong Flow Regimes, (2010)","","Blackwell Publishing Inc. subscrip@blackwellpub.com","","","","","","1753318X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954565768"

The basic functions of breathing are to exchange gases (supplying oxygen from ambient air and removing carbon dioxide from the blood) and also to exchange heat and moisture through mucous surfaces of the airway. During an average lifetime, human beings experience significant exposure to indoor air and countless of contaminants/particles via inhalation. In this study, experimental and numerical results of flow fields in a realistic respiratory model were obtained. Flow patterns in a realistic replica model of the human respiratory tract were investigated with particle image velocimetry (PIV) under three constant breathing conditions; 7.5, 15 and 30 L/min. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were conducted on turbulent models with boundary conditions corresponding to the experimental models.

They view learning as a controllable process and accept more responsibility for the results of this process. The research described in this article proposes, implements, and evaluates an ePortfolio-based self-regulated learning model. An ePortfolio system was developed based on self-regulated learning theories. This ePortfolio system was used in designing a learning model for fostering self-regulated learning in higher education. Two surveys were conducted with the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the courses. The differences in Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire scales between pre-test and post-test, or control group and experimental group were evaluated. The trace data of learning activity were also analyzed to evaluate the effects of the learning model on students’ self-regulated learning. The results show that students implemented self-regulated learning processes, and their intrinsic goal orientation, metacognitive self-regulation, effort regulation, elaboration, rehearsal, and critical thinking improved after applying ePortfolio-based learning model in the courses. In conclusion, the ePortfolio system and the proposed learning model had positive effects on students’ self-regulated learning skills. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competency Measuring; Eportfolio-based Learning; Self-regulated Learning","","","","","Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, (2008); Learning and Leading with Technology, (1998); Self Regulated Learning in Technology Enhanced Learning Environments, (2011); Cheang, Kai I., Effect of learner-centered teaching on motivation and learning strategies in a third-year pharmacotherapy course, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 73, 3, (2009); Devolder, Anneline, Supporting self-regulated learning in computer-based learning environments: Systematic review of effects of scaffolding in the domain of science education, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 28, 6, pp. 557-573, (2012); Gadbury-Amyot, Cynthia C., Validity and reliability of portfolio assessment of competency in a baccalaureate dental hygiene program., Journal of Dental Education, 67, 9, pp. 991-1002, (2003); Hadwin, Allyson F., Examining trace data to explore self-regulated learning, Metacognition and Learning, 2, 2-3, pp. 107-124, (2007); Hadwin, Allyson F., Innovative ways for using gStudy to orchestrate and research social aspects of self-regulated learning, Computers in Human Behavior, 26, 5, pp. 794-805, (2010); Holocher-Ertl, Teresa, Self-regulated learners and collaboration: How innovative tools can address the motivation to learn at the workplace?, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6964 LNCS, pp. 506-511, (2011); Effective Practice with E Portfolios Supporting 21st Century Learning, (2008)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","14697874; 17412625","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947797389"

The most consistent result suggests wholly foreign MNEs impart negative spillovers while joint ventures tend to generate positive spillovers.

However, many languages still lack treebanks and building a treebank can be very complicated and difficult. This work has a twofold objective. Firstly, to share our results in constructing a large Vietnamese treebank (VTB) with three levels of annotation including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. Major steps in the treebank construction process are described with particular regard to specific Vietnamese properties such as lack of word delimiter and isolation. Those properties make sentences highly syntactically ambiguous, and therefore it is difficult to ensure a high level of agreement among annotators. Various studies of Vietnamese syntax were employed not only to define annotations but also to systematically deal with ambiguities. Annotators were supported by automatic labelling tools, which are based on statistical machine learning methods, for sentence pre-processing and a tree editor for supporting manual annotation. As a result, an annotation agreement of around 90 % was achieved. Our second objective is to present our method for automatically finding errors and inconsistencies in treebank corpora and its application to the construction of the VTB. This method employs the Shannon entropy measure in a manner that the more reduced entropy the more corrected errors in a treebank. The method ranks error candidates by using a scoring function based on conditional entropy. Our experiments showed that this method detected high-error-density subsets of original error candidate sets, and that the corpus entropy was significantly reduced after error correction. The size of these subsets was only about one third of the whole set, while these subsets contained 80–90 % of the total errors. This method can also be applied to languages similar to Vietnamese. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entropy; Error Detection; Treebank","","","","This paper is supported by the project QGTĐ.12.21 funded by Vietnam National University, Hanoi.

In order to understand more about the innate resources of displaced rural communities, we applied a community resilience approach to two resettled Co-tu ethnic minority villages in an upland area in central Vietnam to identify their community capitals and their application in improving livelihoods and living conditions. We found that weak human and financial capital constrained the ability of the resettled residents to adopt new livelihoods or migrate to seek employment. Reduced forest and river access also problematised responses to a lack of agricultural land. However, traditionally strong village affinity and social networks were retained. In addition, indigenous skills such as housing construction, honed by a highly mobile traditional lifestyle, allowed residents to construct culturally significant structures like community houses and modify or augment received housing stock. These elements of social and cultural capital eased the process of post-resettlement adaptation. We conclude that governments should reassess current resettlement policies that prioritise financial compensation and should incorporate awareness of the adaptive resilience and limitations fostered by indigenous knowledge and practices in resettlement action plans. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Community Capitals; Community Resilience; Dam-induced Displacement; Resettlement; Sustainable Rural Livelihoods; Dam Construction; Ethnic Minority; Forced Migration; Hydroelectric Power Plant; Indigenous Population; Marginalization; Regulatory Framework; Resettlement Policy; Social Capital; Socioeconomic Conditions; Viet Nam","dam construction; ethnic minority; forced migration; hydroelectric power plant; indigenous population; marginalization; regulatory framework; resettlement policy; social capital; socioeconomic conditions; Viet Nam","","","","Agrawal, Arun, Dismantling the Divide Between Indigenous and Scientific Knowledge, Development and Change, 26, 3, pp. 413-439, (1995); Ahern, Jennifer, Social context and depression after a disaster: The role of income inequality, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 60, 9, pp. 766-770, (2006); Ahmed, Rashid, Discerning community resilience in disadvantaged communities in the context of violence and injury prevention, South African Journal of Psychology, 34, 3, pp. 386-408, (2004); Katu Village an Interpretive Ethnography of the A Vuong Katu in Central Vietnam, (2010); undefined, (2007); Baulch, Bob, Ethnic minority development in Vietnam, Journal of Development Studies, 43, 7, pp. 1151-1176, (2007); Berkes, Fikret, Community Resilience: Toward an Integrated Approach, Society and Natural Resources, 26, 1, pp. 5-20, (2013); Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, (1986); Bui, Hang Thi Minh, Resettling Farm Households in Northwestern Vietnam: Livelihood Change and Adaptation, International Journal of Water Resources Development, 27, 4, pp. 769-785, (2011); Risks and Reconstruction Experiences of Resettlers and Refugees, (2000)","","","","","","","","14678373; 13607456","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946190608"

In modern society, the need for multi-language communication is great. These days anyone can easily obtain a translation from a foreign language. These days anyone can easily take a language course or a translation course. This means that almost anyone can participate in the work of translation. Accordingly, there are many texts that have been translated with diverse shades of meaning and different degrees of quality. Assessment of translation quality based on research into translating methods is indispensable. However, due to the lack of an appropriate methodological framework, current translation assessment mostly focuses on things like fixing vocabulary and syntax or analyzing errors, rather than evaluating the translation work in general. Thus, the problem for the evaluation of a translation is to identify an appropriate methodological framework. And the key to the methodological framework is “objectivity” in the assessment. Although many theoretical models have been put forward, translation assessment is still mostly concerned with matters such as how to reduce the subjective factors of translation and the establishment of criteria by which the assessment could look at problems correctly from many different directions. Scholars today can build on the research achievements of predecessors such as the view of “dynamic equivalence” of Eugene Nida, the seven translation methods of Vinay and Darbelnet, and the quality assessment model of Juliane House. In this essay, the authors examine some of the issues related to translation models and translation quality assessment. They propose some objective measures for assessing a translated document. In the final section of this essay, they apply the assessment criteria they proposed earlier (in the third section) to analyze and demonstrate how their model works in an actual investigation. The authors present an analysis of problems with the translation of Natsume Sōseki’s novel Kokoro into Vietnamese, in the hope the translation assessment criteria that they offer will be seen as useful in developing a theoretical framework for the translation field and will become accepted as the basic theory for translators, helping them to avoid unnecessary mistakes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Equivalence; Eugene Nida; Kokoro; Natsume Soseki; Nỗi Lòng; Theoretical Frameworks For Translation; Translation; Translation Model; Translation Process; Translation Quality Assessment; Translation Quality Standard; Vinay And Darbelnet","","","","","","","International Research Center for Japanese Studies","","","","","","1883096X","","","","Japanese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961340252"

In middle-income countries, however, the migration of skilled workers becomes the more important factor in economic progress. Evaluating the skill content of migration patterns therefore is essential to understanding migration's economic implications. For this purpose, we investigate the determinants of skilled and unskilled migration decisions in Vietnam. Rural higher education is shown to promote knowledge-intensive production by encouraging skilled individuals to migrate to cities. In complementary fashion, commercial farm development helps alleviate urban overcrowding by encouraging unskilled individuals to remain at home. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Education; Labor Migration; Labor Skills; Middle-income Countries; Southeast Asia; Vietnam; Agricultural Economics; Higher Education; Labor Migration; Skilled Labor; Urban Economy; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","agricultural economics; higher education; labor migration; skilled labor; urban economy; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","","","We thank Steven Buccola at Oregon State University, three anonymous referees, and Arun Agrawal for valuable suggestions on earlier versions of the manuscript.

One approach to detecting paraphrases is to use predicate argument tuples. Although this approach achieves high paraphrase recall, its accuracy is generally low. Other approaches focus on matching similar words, but word meaning is often contextual (e.g., 'get along with,' 'look forward to'). An effective approach to detecting plagiarism would take into account the fact that plagiarists frequently cut and paste whole phrases and/or replace several words with similar words. This generally results in the paraphrased text containing identical phrases and similar words. Moreover, plagiarists usually insert and/or remove various minor words (prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) to both improve the naturalness and disguise the paraphrasing. We have developed a similarity matching (SimMat) metric for detecting paraphrases that is based on matching identical phrases and similar words and quantifying the minor words. The metric achieved the highest paraphrase detection accuracy (77.6%) when it was combined with eight standard machine translation metrics. This accuracy is better than the 77.4% rate achieved with the state-of-The-Art approach for paraphrase detection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Intellectual Property; Cut-and-paste; Detecting Plagiarism; Detection Accuracy; Effective Approaches; Natural Language Processing; Similarity-matching; Standard Machines; State-of-the-art Approach; Natural Language Processing Systems","Computational linguistics; Intellectual property; Cut-and-paste; Detecting plagiarism; Detection accuracy; Effective approaches; NAtural language processing; Similarity-matching; Standard machines; State-of-the-art approach; Natural language processing systems","","","","Blacoe, William, A comparison of vector-based representations for semantic composition, pp. 546-556, (2012); Chan, Yee Seng, MAXSIM: A maximum similarity metric for machine translation evaluation, pp. 55-62, (2008); Das, Dipanjan, Paraphrase identification as probabilistic quasi-synchronous recognition, pp. 468-476, (2009); Denkowski, Michael J., Extending the METEOR machine translation evaluation metric to the phrase level, pp. 250-253, (2010); Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Human Language Technology Research, (2002); Dolan, Bill, Unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora: Exploiting massively parallel news sources, (2004); Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Paraphrasing Iwp2005, (2005); Proceedings of the NIST Metrics for Machine Translation Workshop at the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas Conference, (2008); Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, (1955); Madnani, Nitin, Re-examining machine translation metrics for paraphrase identification, pp. 182-190, (2012)","","Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2200 Xietu Rd no.25, Shanghai 200032","","29th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, PACLIC 2015","","Shanghai","119467","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84967139429"

Ethanol mixed with gasoline in mandatory percentages has been used in many countries. However, production of ethanol mainly depends on food crops, commonly associated with problems such as governmental policies and social controversies. Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is one of the most potential and appropriate alternative crops for biofuel production because of its high biomass and sugar content, strong tolerance to environmental stress conditions and diseases, and wide adaptability to various soils and climates. The aim of this study was to select prospective varieties of sweet sorghum, optimum sowing times and densities to achieve high yields of ethanol production and to establish stable operational conditions in cultivating this crop. The summer-autumn cropping season combined with the sowing densities of 8.3-10.9 plant m-2 obtained the highest ethanol yield. Among cultivated locations, the soil with pH of 5.5 and contents of Al and Zn of 39.4 and 0.6 g kg-1, respectively, was the best condition to have an ethanol yield >5000 L ha-1. The pH ≥ 6.0 may be responsible for the significant reduction of zinc content in soils, which decreases both biomass of sweet sorghum and ethanol yield, while contents of N, P, K, organic carbon (OC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC), and Fe likely play no role. The cultivar 4A was the preferred candidate for ethanol production and resistant to pests and diseases, especially cut worm (Agrotis spp.). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Ethanol; Ethanol Yield; Pests And Diseases; Sowing Time; Sweet Sorghum; Biofuel; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Crop Yield; Cropping Practice; Ethanol; Fossil Fuel; Ion Exchange; Organic Carbon; Sorghum; Sowing; Sugar; Agrotis; Sorghum Bicolor","biofuel; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; crop yield; cropping practice; ethanol; fossil fuel; ion exchange; organic carbon; sorghum; sowing; sugar; Agrotis; Sorghum bicolor","","","","Fischer, Axel René, Biotic and abiotic transformations of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 12, 6, pp. 381-386, (2005); Belpoggi, Fiorella, Methyl-tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) — A gasoline additive — causes testicular and lympho haematopoietic cancers in rats, Toxicology and Industrial Health, 11, 2, pp. 119-149, (1995); Cassada, David A., Trace analysis of ethanol, MTBE, and related oxygenate compounds in water using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, Analytical Chemistry, 72, 19, pp. 4654-4658, (2000); Biofuels Engineering Process Technology, (2008); Almodares, Abbas A., Production of bioethanol from sweet sorghum: A review, African Journal of Agricultural Research, 4, 9, pp. 772-780, (2009); Balat, Mustafa, Recent trends in global production and utilization of bio-ethanol fuel, Applied Energy, 86, 11, pp. 2273-2282, (2009); Thammasat Int J Sci Technol, (2007); Pulidindi, Indra Neel, Can cellulose be a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production?, Renewable Energy, 71, pp. 77-80, (2014); Wang, Mingxin, Energy efficiency and environmental performance of bioethanol production from sweet sorghum stem based on life cycle analysis, Bioresource Technology, 163, pp. 74-81, (2014); Yu, Menghui, Optimization of ethanol production from NaOH-pretreated solid state fermented sweet sorghum bagasse, Energies, 7, 7, pp. 4054-4067, (2014)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944463058"

The results indicated total carbon stock increased from 75 tons C/ha in very poor forest to 199 tons C/ha in medium forest, and to 255 tons C/ha in very rich forest. Carbon stock in necromass was significant different (ANOVA; F(4,145) = 61.70, p < 0.001) among forest categories (from 4 to 8 tons C/ha). Meanwhile, there were no differences of carbon stock in soil and short vegetation layer among forest categories, which ranged 59-64 tons C/ha and 3-4 tons C/ha, respectively. There was a linear positive relationship between carbon in big trees and that in necromass (R(149) = 0.61, p < 0.01). It is concluded that the degree of human disturbance had significant impacts on carbon sink in the present study forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Tree Biomass; Carbon Stock; Necromass; Soil Carbon; Tropical Evergreen Broadleaf Forest; Broad-leaved Forest; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Carbon Sequestration; Carbon Sink; Evergreen Forest; Human Activity; Soil Carbon; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","broad-leaved forest; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; evergreen forest; human activity; soil carbon; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","","","","Baishya, Ratul, Estimation of tree biomass, carbon pool and net primary production of an old-growth Pinus kesiya Royle ex.

Several logit model estimates were made using the samples from the six countries separately and together. We obtained three main findings. First, attitude variables about the car were all significant determinants for the entire sample from Asian countries. Second, the social orderliness aspect of public transit was a common concern of respondents from developing countries in selecting this mode for work trips. Third, in countries in which the intent to use a car was not very high, attitude factors about the car were found to be significant determinants of the behavioral intention to commute by car but were less significant in countries in which the desire to use a car was high. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes Toward Travel Modes; Commuting Mode Choice; Mobility Management; Psychological Methods; Developing Countries; Logistic Regression; Commuting Modes; Environmental Friendliness; Explanatory Variables; Mobility Management; Psychological Factors; Psychological Methods; Public Transportation; Travel Modes; Urban Transportation; Altruism; Car Use; Commuting; Developing World; Logit Analysis; Psychology; Public Transport; Transportation Safety; Transportation System; Travel Behavior; China; Indonesia; Japan; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","Developing countries; Logistic regression; Commuting modes; Environmental friendliness; Explanatory variables; Mobility management; Psychological factors; Psychological methods; Public transportation; Travel modes; Urban transportation; altruism; car use; commuting; developing world; logit analysis; psychology; public transport; transportation safety; transportation system; travel behavior; China; Indonesia; Japan; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","","","The survey in this study was supported by the research group for the “Applicability of Ecological Transportation Systems in Developing Countries” of the International Association of Traffic and Safety Science.

First, with operational quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) over a forecast horizon (FH), the ISOS is applied to obtain an optimal rule for dam releases; second, with the corrected satellite precipitation, the prescribed rule is employed for the reservoir operation over a decision horizon (DH). The ISOS is applied to the Red River Basin (169,000 km2), to test its performance for optimizing multidam releases in the large river basin. Results show that by using the ISOS, two things were simultaneously achieved, reducing the water level at Hanoi to avoid flooding while raising water storage in Hoa Binh reservoir at the end of flood season for better hydropower generation.

This paper critically examines three recent initiatives in Vietnam that promise to promote more stable livelihoods for displaced populations and to strengthen participation in development for residents as well as civil society. The first is a payment for environmental services (PES) scheme for hydroelectric revenue sharing to fund forest maintenance and monitoring by displaced households, while the second focus is an international financial institution (IFI)-initiated project that prioritizes gender empowerment and participation. The PES scheme promises a sustainable income stream for displaced households and has institutionalized legal and government backing, but it entails high transaction costs and a lengthy planning phase. The IFI project offers residents generous compensation and the rights embodied in IFI involuntary safeguards, but a lack of effective livelihood support and poor communication provide cautionary notes. A third, rights-based approach by Vietnamese civil society organizations (CSOs) involves advocacy to achieve effective reallocation of state-managed forest land to displaced villagers. The authors examine the potential for benefit-sharing mechanisms, IFIs, and CSOs, backed by new legislation and expanding space for civil society in Vietnam, to address the problems posed by inadequate local governance. They conclude that these approaches show merit for nationwide replication, and there is a need for including these external stakeholders in local resettlement management bodies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benefit-sharing Mechanisms; Civil Society Organizations; Development-induced Displacement; Hydropower Dams; Resettlement; Vietnam; Agricultural Land; Civil Society; Dam Construction; Governance Approach; Hydrogeology; Legislative Implementation; Participatory Approach; Resettlement Policy; Stakeholder; Viet Nam","agricultural land; civil society; dam construction; governance approach; hydrogeology; legislative implementation; participatory approach; resettlement policy; stakeholder; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: In 2008 the Asian Development Bank approved the first direct investment by an IFI in hydropower dam construction in Vietnam with a US$196 million loan for the 156MW Song Bung 4 dam in Quang Nam province. The stated objective was “meeting Vietnam’s increasing power demand in an environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive manner” ( [2] ), which alludes to two elements – a comprehensive social and environmental impact assessment and institutional mechanisms for transparent information disclosure and participation in resettlement decision-making by affected persons (APs) – that have been criticized for poor or nonexistent implementation in other Vietnamese large dam projects [17] . The project included a US$2 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for village-level initiatives, including training and agricultural support, to achieve livelihood restoration and improvement [8] . For the ADB, an important component of the dam project was the resettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP) that details resettlement procedures, compensation and livelihood support provisions, and grievance mechanisms. Compliance with the ADB safeguards generally exceeds what is required to meet the provisions of Vietnamese national law in assisting displaced people. For example, the safeguards state that compensation for income loss must be provided to all affected resettlers rather than only to registered businesses, as required by the Vietnamese government, and that customary land rights be recognized by protection or compensation, an area not yet fully recognized by Vietnamese law [5] .; Funding text 2: The Center for Social Research and Development (CSRD), a legally recognized Vietnamese NGO based in Hue, central Vietnam, focuses its efforts on climate change and water resource management. Although affiliated with VUSTA the NGO is financially and administratively independent, according to director Lam Thi Thu Suu (personal communication, 2013), with most funding coming from INGOs and bilateral official development assistance. CRSD implemented a project from 2010 to 2012 in eight ethnic minority villages in two communes in central Thua Thien Hue province that had been resettled due to construction of an irrigation dam and the Binh Diem hydropower dam. The project was funded by a 155,000 Euro grant from ICCO, the Dutch government-funded INGO, and carried out by CSRD and another local NGO, the Consultative and Research Center on Natural Resources Management (CORENARM), in order to improve access to forest land, increase business skills and promote gender awareness among APs.","undefined, (2003); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2009); undefined, (2010); undefined, (2010); undefined, (2011); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2013); Beckman, Malin, Converging and conflicting interests in adaptation to environmental change in central Vietnam, Climate and Development, 3, 1, pp. 32-41, (2011); Bui, Hang Thi Minh, Resettling Farm Households in Northwestern Vietnam: Livelihood Change and Adaptation, International Journal of Water Resources Development, 27, 4, pp. 769-785, (2011)","","Elsevier","","","","","","22126082","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926652004"

The material properties of the FG beams are assumed to vary continuously in the thickness direction by a power-law distribution. Based on the strain energy expression, a shear deformable beam element, taking the effect of the material non-homogeneity and the foundation support into account, is formulated and employed in the analysis. An incremental/iterative procedure in combination with the arc-length control method is used for solving nonlinear equilibrium equations. The numerical results show that the convergence of the formulated element is fast, and the large displacements of the beams can be accurately assessed by using a few numbers of the elements. A parametric study is carried out to highlight the effect of the material non-homogeneity and the foundation support on the large deflection behavior of the beams. The influence of the aspect ratio on the large deflection response of the beam is also examined and highlighted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Elastic Foundation; Finite Element Method; Functionally Graded Beam; Large Deflection Analysis; Aspect Ratio; Deflection (structures); Foundations; Nonlinear Equations; Shear Deformation; Shear Flow; Strain Energy; Elastic Foundation; Finite Element Procedure; Functionally Graded Beams; Large Deflection Analysis; Large Deflection Behaviors; Non-linear Equilibrium Equation; Power Law Distribution; Shear Deformable Beams; Finite Element Method","Aspect ratio; Deflection (structures); Foundations; Nonlinear equations; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Strain energy; Elastic foundation; Finite element procedure; Functionally graded beams; Large deflection analysis; Large deflection behaviors; Non-linear equilibrium equation; Power law distribution; Shear deformable beams; Finite element method","","","","Birman, Victor M., Modeling and analysis of functionally graded materials and structures, Applied Mechanics Reviews, 60, 1-6, pp. 195-216, (2007); Chakraborty, Abir, A new beam finite element for the analysis of functionally graded materials, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 45, 3, pp. 519-539, (2003); Finite Elements and Solution Procedures for Structural Analysis, (1986); Non Linear Finite Element Analysis of Solids and Structures, (1991); Dutta, Sekhar Chandra, A critical review on idealization and modeling for interaction among soil-foundation-structure system, Computers and Structures, 80, 20-21, pp. 1579-1594, (2002); Fallah, Ali, Nonlinear free vibration and post-buckling analysis of functionally graded beams on nonlinear elastic foundation, European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids, 30, 4, pp. 571-583, (2011); Beams on Elastic Foundation, (1946); Horibe, Tadashi, Large deflection analysis of beams on two-parameter elascticfoundation using the boundary integral equation method, JSME International Journal, Series A: Solid Mechanics and Material Engineering, 44, 2, pp. 231-236, (2001); Kang, Yingan, Bending of functionally graded cantilever beam with power-law non-linearity subjected to an end force, International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics, 44, 6, pp. 696-703, (2009); Kang, Yingan, Large deflections of a non-linear cantilever functionally graded beam, Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites, 29, 12, pp. 1761-1774, (2010)","","Architectural Institute of Japan michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","13472852; 13467581","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907569056"

Both virtual access point (VAP) and wireless virtualization (WV) techniques have been combined in an appropriate way thereby the networks can be automatically setup on-demand using on-site commodity mobile devices (laptops, tablet PCs, smart phones). In the proposed approach, difficulties remained from conventional access network technologies such as the requirements of installing special hardware (e.g. multiple network interface cards - NICs, particular mesh routers, etc.,) and software (e.g. network auto-configuration software including routing protocols) on each mobile node (MN) in advance have been resolved. As a result, users can connect to the proposed MDRAN as easily as connecting to conventional APs. After connecting to the proposed network, users naturally and unconsciously contribute to the network extension. This feature improves the self-supporting capability at the disaster's local communities. Experimental evaluations reveal the feasibility, effectiveness as well as the scalability of the proposed approach. As a result, the proposed scheme is ready to be realized in the actual disaster recovery applications. © Rinton Press. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access Network; Multihop Communications; Resilience; Virtual Access Point; Wireless Virtualization; Disasters; Mobile Devices; Personal Computers; Recovery; Virtual Reality; Access Network; Access Points; Multi Hop Communication; Resilience; Wireless Virtualization; Computer System Recovery","Disasters; Mobile devices; Personal computers; Recovery; Virtual reality; Access network; Access points; Multi hop communication; Resilience; Wireless virtualization; Computer system recovery","","","","Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, (2014); Sterbenz, James P.G., Resilience and survivability in communication networks: Strategies, principles, and survey of disciplines, Computer Networks, 54, 8, pp. 1245-1265, (2010); Ishmael, Johnathan, Deploying rural community wireless mesh networks, IEEE Internet Computing, 12, 4, pp. 22-29, (2008); Pelusi, Luciana, Opportunistic networking: Data forwarding in disconnected mobile ad hoc networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 44, 11, pp. 134-141, (2006); McMahon, Alex, Delay-and disruption-tolerant networking, IEEE Internet Computing, 13, 6, pp. 82-87, (2009); Yarali, Abdulrahman, WiMAX: The innovative broadband wireless access technology, Journal of Communications, 3, 2, pp. 53-63, (2008); Doumi, Tewfik L., LTE for public safety networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 51, 2, pp. 106-112, (2013); Uchida, Norihiko, Never die network extended with cognitive wireless network for disaster information system, pp. 24-31, (2011); Yarali, Abdulrahman, Wireless mesh networking: A key solution for emergency & rural applications, pp. 143-149, (2009); Junhai, Luo, A survey of multicast routing protocols for mobile Ad-Hoc networks, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 11, 1, pp. 78-91, (2009)","","Rinton Press Inc. sales@rintonpress.com","","","","","","15504646; 15504654","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898031602"

Whilst experimental results show strong performance in-domain it has been recognised that quality suffers when models are applied to heterogeneous text collections. However the causal factors have until now been uncertain. In this paper we describe a controlled experiment into near domain bias for two Medline corpora on hereditary diseases. Five strategies are employed for mitigating the impact of near domain transference including simple transference, pooling, stacking, class re-labeling and feature augmentation. We measure their effect on f-score performance against an in domain baseline. Stacking and feature augmentation mitigate f-score loss but do not necessarily result in superior performance except for selected classes. Simple pooling of data across domains failed to exploit size effects for most classes. We conclude that we can expect lower performance and higher annotation costs if we do not adequately compensate for the distributional dissimilarities of domains during learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Character Recognition; 'current; Biomedical Named Entity Recognition; Controlled Experiment; Domain Transfers; F-score; Performance; Sample Sizes; Simple++; Stackings; Text Collection; Natural Language Processing Systems","Character recognition; 'current; Biomedical named entity recognition; Controlled experiment; Domain transfers; F-score; Performance; Sample sizes; Simple++; Stackings; Text collection; Natural language processing systems","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the many helpful comments from the anonymous reviewers of this paper.

An ePortfolio system was developed based on self-regulated learning models and the relations among ePortfolio, competency, and self-regulated learning models. Then, the ePortfolio system was used for designing a learning model for self-regulated learning. The first experiments of the model were conducted in software engineering courses at the Hoa Sen University, Vietnam. The surveys with the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) were conducted at the beginning and at the end of the courses. The differences in MSLQ scales between pre- and post-tests, and between control and experimental groups were evaluated. In addition, the trace data of learning was also analyzed in order to evaluate the effects of the learning model on student self-regulated learning. The results show that students could implement and link self-regulated learning processes in the ePortfolio system. In addition, the scores of MSLQ scales improved after applying the ePortfolio-based learning model in the courses. In conclusion, the ePortfolio system and the proposed learning model had positive effects on students' self-regulated learning skills. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competency Measuring; Eportfolio System; Self-regulated Learning; Education; Software Engineering; Students; Surveys; Competency Measuring; E-portfolios; Experimental Groups; Learning Models; Post Test; Self-regulated Learning; Software Engineering Course; Trace Data; Education Computing","Education; Software engineering; Students; Surveys; Competency measuring; E-portfolios; Experimental groups; Learning models; Post test; Self-regulated learning; Software engineering course; Trace data; Education computing","","","","Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, (2008); Self Regulated Learning in Technology Enhanced Learning Environments, (2011); Cheang, Kai I., Effect of learner-centered teaching on motivation and learning strategies in a third-year pharmacotherapy course, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 73, 3, (2009); Devolder, Anneline, Supporting self-regulated learning in computer-based learning environments: Systematic review of effects of scaffolding in the domain of science education, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 28, 6, pp. 557-573, (2012); Gadbury-Amyot, Cynthia C., Validity and reliability of portfolio assessment of competency in a baccalaureate dental hygiene program., Journal of Dental Education, 67, 9, pp. 991-1002, (2003); Hadwin, Allyson F., Innovative ways for using gStudy to orchestrate and research social aspects of self-regulated learning, Computers in Human Behavior, 26, 5, pp. 794-805, (2010); Effective Practice with E Portfolios Supporting 21st Century Learning, (2008); Teacher Newsmagazine, (2013); Pintrich, Paul R., A conceptual framework for assessing motivation and self-regulated learning in college students, Educational Psychology Review, 16, 4, pp. 385-407, (2004); Rao, Sishir, E-portfolio competency metadata: Pilot study for a call to action, Journal of Medical Systems, 36, 2, pp. 457-462, (2012)","Ogata, H.; Lomicka-Anderson, L.; Chai, C.-S.; Hampel, R.; Hayashi, Y.; Vassileva, J.; Liu, C.-C.; Chen, W.; Hsu, J.; Lan, Y.-J.; Mason, J.; Yamada, M.; Shyu, H.-Y.; Weerasinghe, A.; Wu, Y.-T.; Zhang, L.; Kinshuk; Matsubara, Y.; Miao, Y.; Ogata, H.; Kong, S.C.; Chang, M.; Jong, M.S.Y.; Kuo, R.; Robson, R.; Wasson, B.; Kashihara, A.; Cress, U.; Jansen, M.; Oshima, J.; Yin, C.; Zhang, J.; Chinn, C.","Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education No. 300, Jhongda Road, Jhongli City, Taoyuan County 32001","et al.; KANSAI-OSAKA 21st Century Association; KDDI Foundation; Support Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology Research, Foundation; Tateisi Science and Technology Foundation; The Telecommunications Advancement Foundation","22nd International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2014","","Nara; Nara Prefectural New Public Hall","110495","","9784990801410","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923878958"

The proposed access protocol is based on the scheme of locating idle time slot at all wavelengths before sending bursts. This would help to avoid burst collision and efficiently use wavelength resource. To support this access protocol, a low-cost node architecture that provides burst transmission on multiple wavelengths is also proposed. The numerical results show that OBS-ring network using proposed access protocol outperforms the ones using wavelength-based and multi-token-based access protocols in terms of mean queuing delay. In addition, it can support a larger number of nodes and high burst arrival rate compared to that of the conventional OBR-ring networks. © 2013 IEEE. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Burst Transmission; High Burst Arrival Rate; Mean Queuing Delay; Multiple Wavelengths; Node Architectures; Numerical Results; Optical Burst Switching (obs); Wavelength Resources; Optical Burst Switching; Wavelength; Network Architecture","Burst transmission; High burst arrival rate; Mean queuing delay; Multiple wavelengths; Node architectures; Numerical results; Optical burst switching (OBS); Wavelength resources; Optical burst switching; Wavelength; Network architecture","","","","Optical Burst Switched Networks, (2005); Battestilli, Lina, An introduction to optical burst switching, IEEE Communications Magazine, 41, 8, pp. S10-S15, (2003); Xu, Lisong, A simulation study of optical burst switching and access protocols for WDM ring networks, Computer Networks, 41, 2, pp. 143-160, (2003); Puttasubbappa, Vishwas S., Access protocols to support different service classes in an optical burst switching ring, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3042, pp. 878-889, (2004); Park, Joon-pyo, A low-latency collision-free optical burst switching ring network protocol, (2007); Fumagalli, Andrea F., A low-latency and bandwidth-efficient distributed optical burst switching architecture for metro ring, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, 2, pp. 1340-1344, (2003); Lin, Hui-Tang, CORNet: A scalable and bandwidth-efficient optical burst switching ring architecture for metro area networks, pp. 100-108, (2006); Peng, Limei, On the design of node architectures and MAC protocols for optical burst-switched ring networks, Photonic Network Communications, 21, 3, pp. 267-277, (2011); Fundamentals of Queueing Theory, (2018)","","","Duy Tan University; Natl.

However, the algorithms which were recently proposed are applied only to the problems with small size, i.e., 26 vertices. In this paper, we present a new exact algorithm to solve the MLPs with a larger size.

However, HMM-based TTS is far from natural. On the contrary, unit selection TTS is the most-natural sounding TTS currently. However, its intelligibility and naturalness on segmental duration and timing are not stable. Additionally, unit selection needs to store a huge amount of data for concatenation. Recently, hybrid approaches between these two TTS, i.e. the HMM trajectory tiling TTS (HTT), have been studied to take advantages of both unit selection and HMM-based TTS. However, such methods still require a huge amount of data for rendering. In this paper, a hybrid TTS among unit selection, HMM-based TTS, and the Modified Restricted Temporal Decomposition (MRTD), named HTD, is proposed motivating to take advantages of both unit selection and HMM-based TTS under limited data conditions. Here, TD is a sparse representation of speech that decomposes a spectral or prosodic sequence into two mutually independent components: static event targets and correspondent dynamic event functions, and MRTD is a compact but efficient version of TD. Previous studies show that the dynamic event functions of MRTD are related to the perception of speech intelligibility, one core linguistic or content information, while the static event targets of MRTD convey non-linguistic or style information. Therefore, by borrowing the concepts of unit selection to render the event targets of the spectral sequence, and directly borrowing the prosodic sequences and the dynamic event functions of the spectral sequence generated by HMM-based TTS, the naturalness and the intelligibility of the proposed HTD can reach the naturalness of unit selection, and the intelligibility of HMM-based TTS, respectively. Due to the smoothness of event functions of MRTD, an appropriate smoothness in synthesized speech can still be ensured when being rendering by a small amount of data, resulting in the usability of the proposed HTD under limited data conditions. The experimental results with a small Vietnamese dataset, simulated to be a ""limited data condition"", show that the proposed HTD outperformed all HMM-based TTS, unit selection, HTT under a limited data condition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hmm-based; Htt; Temporal Decomposition; Tts; Unit Selection; Linguistics; Condition; Dynamic Events; Event Functions; Hmm Trajectory Tiling Tts; Hmm-based; Limited Data; Selection Based; Temporal Decomposition; Tts; Unit Selection; Speech Intelligibility","Linguistics; Condition; Dynamic events; Event functions; HMM trajectory tiling TTS; HMM-based; Limited data; Selection based; Temporal decomposition; TTS; Unit selection; Speech intelligibility","","","This study was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (No. 25240026) and the A3 Foresight Program made available by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).","Hunt, Andy J., Unit selection in a concatenative speech synthesis system using a large speech database, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 1, pp. 373-376, (1996); Proc of Interspeech, (2005); Toda, Tomoki, A speech parameter generation algorithm considering global variance for HMM-based speech synthesis, IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, E90-D, 5, pp. 816-824, (2007); Qian, Yao, A unified trajectory tiling approach to high quality speech rendering, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 21, 2, pp. 280-290, (2013); Barra-Chicote, Roberto, Analysis of statistical parametric and unit selection speech synthesis systems applied to emotional speech, Speech Communication, 52, 5, pp. 394-404, (2010); Nguyen, Phu Chien, Modified restricted temporal decomposition and its application to low rate speech coding, IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, E86-D, 3, pp. 397-405, (2003); Nguyen, Binh Phu, Efficient modeling of temporal structure of speech for applications in voice transformation, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, pp. 1631-1634, (2009); Popa, Victor, A novel technique for voice conversion based on style and content decomposition with bilinear models, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, pp. 2655-2658, (2009); Atal, Bishnu S., EFFICIENT CODING OF LPC PARAMETERS BY TEMPORAL DECOMPOSITION., Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 1, pp. 81-84, (1983); Kawahara, Hideki, STRAIGHT, exploitation of the other aspect of VOCODER: Perceptually isomorphic decomposition of speech sounds, Acoustical Science and Technology, 27, 6, pp. 349-353, (2006)","","The International Society for Computers and Their Applications (ISCA)","","8th ISCA Tutorial and Research Workshop on Speech Synthesis, SSW 2013","","Barcelona","179946","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133155943"

The Natural Disaster Risk Management Project (NDRMP) adopts an innovative approach to disaster risk management in Vietnam and provides support for disaster prevention and mitigation measures at all levels of government, including at community level where vulnerability prevails. The CBDRM is one component of the NDRMP which aims at strengthening the capacity of villages and communes. It also aims at the disaster management institutions to become more responsive to the short term and longer term needs of the vulnerable communities through participatory risk assessment and identification, prioritization and implementation of risk reduction measures. The project intends to help communes implement activities that deal with natural hazards through capacity building in participatory planning and management. Safer village and commune plans that focus on long term intervention and preparedness measures were developed. The project has been building on existing community based disaster management and risk reduction models, and found empower flood prone communes to prevent and reduce the impact of disasters and secure and protect their livelihoods. The CBDRM activities directly support government efforts for sustainable development by helping reduce human, economic, and financial losses from disasters caused by nature in the target communes. In this chapter, the roles of the local communities, community facilitators, provincial level and central level were defined; this chapter also described how the CBDRM approach could be used to build the capacity of the most vulnerable populations to carry out risk mitigation measures at all levels. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Population growth led by rural-to-urban migration produces lower energy consumption estimates than natural population growth. Thus, energy consumption estimates are lower when a city's population increase is caused by rural-to-urban migration than when urban-to-urban migration and natural population growth are the main drivers of population increases.

A hydrological model was calibrated and validated to model the rainfall-runoff process. Estimates of the water demand of different water sectors were based on the functional relationships between water and productive uses. The estimates were input into a calibrated basin management model for simulation. The climate projections were downscaled to the studied basin. Future land use was predicted using a geographic information system (GIS)-based logistic regression approach. The water balance was examined under various developed scenarios. The results show a relatively high current annual irrigation water deficit at a basin scale; some sub-basins suffer from water shortage, especially during dry seasons and dry years. All water use sectors will be affected to some extent under the impacts of future development and water supply policies. When the new water policy is introduced, the deficits of irrigation and environmental flow are reduced while the power deficit is increased. Considering climate change impact, the annual water deficits are reduced.

Phenotype terms are expected to play a key role in inferring gene function in complex heritable diseases but are intrinsically difficult to analyse due to their complex semantics and scale. In contrast to previous approaches we evaluate state-of-the-art techniques involving the fusion of machine learning on a rich feature set with evidence from extant domain knowledge-sources. The techniques are validated on two gold standard collections including a novel annotated collection of 112 abstracts derived from a systematic search of the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man database for auto-immune diseases. Encouragingly the hybrid model outperforms a HMM, a CRF and a pure knowledge-based method to achieve an F1 of 77.07. Disagreement analysis points to further improvements on this emerging NE task.

The explosion of Internet these days leads to many obstacles for users in searching information due to enormous amount of data collected from multiple media streams. In this case, Semantic Web is believed to bring a solution for information integration. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for an integration system of sports information using semantic web. Semantic annotation of sport news on the web is a way to bring success to our system. We propose an algorithm to generate semantic annotations of sport news that relies on the ontology. Named entities recognition is improved by integrating the KIM information extraction system with this ontology, which is dedicated for sport domain. The concepts and relations of ontology detected in the text are combined with these entities to capture the semantic.

The comparative samples consist of prehistoric and early historic crania from the lower Yangtze River basin, together with recent cranial series from Vietnam, Thailand, South China, and Australia. The results, based mainly on the measure of divergence, are as follows: (1) the early prehistoric northern Vietnam group is distinct from the subsequent inhabitants of northern Vietnam and neighboring populations; (2) the cranial series of northern Vietnam and the surrounding region from the late prehistoric to recent times through early historic period exhibit relative homogeneity, suggesting population continuity; (3) the recent Han Chinese from southern China, one of the possible representatives of East Asians, are relatively distant from all groups from the prehistoric age onwards; and (4) a clear separation of Aboriginal Australians from all the comparative samples, including the early prehistoric northern Vietnamese, is evident. These findings suggest partial support for the two opposing hypotheses, i.e. the two-layer model and the regional-continuity model, for the population history of Southeast Asians, at least, in the northern Vietnamese region.

The natural levees along the Day River, a major distributary of the Song Hong, are comparable in size with those of the main course of the Song Hong. The Day River levees are 3-8 km wide and rise 2-5 m above the adjacent backswamps and have played an important role in human settlements since the late Metal age. We discussed the relationships among the natural levees of the Day River, delta progradation and the distribution of archaeological sites on the delta plain. During the early Holocene, the accumulation of sediment discharged by the Song Hong enhanced both aggradation of the floodplain and river mouth progradation within the drowned valley of the Song Hong. Radiocarbon dates from cores, trench exposures, and archaeological sites record a dramatic slowing of aggradation when sea level stabilized during 6-4 cal. kyr BP (the Holocene sea-level highstand). As sea level fell to the present level during 4-0 cal. kyr BP, the river mouth prograded rapidly toward the Gulf of Bac Bo (Gulf of Tonkin) and the river channels extended seaward. In the West Floodplain, lateral accretion overtook vertical accretion to generate the present longitudinal profiles of the Song Hong and Day rivers. During this period, human settlements spread across the backswamp and Holocene terrace area, lagging around 2 kyr behind the shoreline migration. © The Author(s) 2012. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accumulation Rate; Archaeological Sites; Delta; Natural Levees; Sea-level Change; Shoreline Change; Accretion; Accumulation Rate; Delta; Floodplain; Fluvial Deposit; Holocene; Human Settlement; Levee; Progradation; Radiocarbon Dating; Ria; River Channel; Sea Level Change; Sediment Core; Sediment Transport; Sedimentation Rate; Gulf Of Tonkin; Pacific Ocean; Red River [asia]; South China Sea; Viet Nam","accretion; accumulation rate; delta; floodplain; fluvial deposit; Holocene; human settlement; levee; progradation; radiocarbon dating; ria; river channel; sea level change; sediment core; sediment transport; sedimentation rate; Gulf of Tonkin; Pacific Ocean; Red River [Asia]; South China Sea; Viet Nam","","","","Brierley, Gary John, What is a fluvial levee?, Sedimentary Geology, 114, 1-4, pp. 1-9, (1997); Flood Control Series no 2, (1951); Coleman, James M., Brahmaputra river: Channel processes and sedimentation, Sedimentary Geology, 3, 2-3, pp. 129-239, (1969); Sedimentary Environments Processes Facies and Stratigraphy, (1996); Funabiki, Ayako, Holocene delta plain development in the Song Hong (Red River) delta, Vietnam, Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, 30, 3-4, pp. 518-529, (2007); Goodbred, Steven L., The significance of large sediment supply, active tectonism, and eustasy on margin sequence development: Late Quaternary stratigraphy and evolution of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, Sedimentary Geology, 133, 3-4, pp. 227-248, (2000); Les Editions D Art Et D Aistoire, (1936); Water Science, (2003); Hori, Kazuaki, Delta initiation and Holocene sea-level change: Example from the Song Hong (Red River) delta, Vietnam, Sedimentary Geology, 164, 3-4, pp. 237-249, (2004); Sedimentary Facies in the Active Plate Margin, (1989)","","","","","","","","14770911; 09596836","","HOLOE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861810556"

Conservation policies and practices also accelerate changes in swidden by restricting forest clearing and encouraging commercial agriculture. However, swidden remains important in many frontier areas where farmers have unequal or insecure access to investment and market opportunities, or where multi-functionality of land uses has been preserved as a strategy to adapt to current ecological, economic and political circumstances. In some areas swidden remains important simply because intensification is not a viable choice, for example when population densities and/or food market demands are low. The transformation of swidden landscapes into more intensive land uses has generally increased household incomes, but has also led to negative effects on the social and human capital of local communities to varying degrees. From an environmental perspective, the transition from swidden to other land uses often contributes to permanent deforestation, loss of biodiversity, increased weed pressure, declines in soil fertility, and accelerated soil erosion.

On the other hand, many cities are facing problems caused by urbanization. The urban heat island phenomenon, one of the urban climate problems, is a typical environmental problem encountered in dense urban areas in summer. The use of the sea breeze to mitigate the urban heat island phenomenon has attracted attention in coastal cities. Some statistics show that about 40% of the world’s population lives within 100 km of the coast (World Resources Institute, Fisheries (2007) Population within 100 km of coast). Further investigation of the environment in the urban area near the coast is, therefore, important. In this chapter, Tokyo is targeted for investigation. Tokyo is the Japanese capital, and its surrounding region, the Tokyo metropolitan area, comprises a circular area with a radius of 50 km and a population of over 30 million. Within this area, the sea breeze from Tokyo Bay is an important factor mitigating the air temperature rise in summer. However, ongoing urbanization could be changing not only the mechanism of the energy balance on the urban surface but also the sea breeze system in the region. To clarify the effects of urbanization, a mesoscale meteorological model was adopted for analysis. Simulation results suggest that expansion of the Tokyo metropolitan area from the 1970s to the 1990s has induced a temperature rise near the ground and that the difference is largest in inland areas. Moreover, the time of sea breeze penetration is delayed in suburban areas. These results suggest that the ongoing urbanization process could raise the air temperature and change the sea breeze system in the Tokyo metropolitan area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Land Use Change; Mesoscale Meteorological Model; Urban Boundary Layer; Urban Climate; Urban Heat Island Phenomenon","","","","","Mon Wea Rev, (1978); Dudhia, Jimy, Numerical study of convection observed during the Winter Monsoon Experiment using a mesoscale two-dimensional model, Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 46, 20, pp. 3077-3107, (1989); Sixth Psu Ncar Mesoscale Model Users Workshop, (1996); Psu Ncar Mesoscale Modeling System Tutorial Class Notes and User S Guide Mm5 Modeling System Version 3, (2004); Nairikutoshi Ha Naze Atsuika, (2010); A Description of the Fifth Generation Penn State Ncar Mesoscale Model Mm5, (1994); Gross, Günter, Results of supercomputer simulations of meteorological mesoscale phenomena, Fluid Dynamics Research, 10, 4-6, pp. 483-498, (1992); Climate of London, (1833); Janjić, Zaviša I., The step-mountain coordinate: physical package, Monthly Weather Review, 118, 7, pp. 1429-1443, (1990); Kawamoto, Yoichi, Improvement of parameterization of ground surface andincorporationofanthropogenic heatrelease Development ofurban climate analysis modelusing MM5 Part1, Journal of Environmental Engineering (Japan), 73, 631, pp. 1125-1132, (2008)","","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","","9789400727717; 9789400727700","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013018911"

To prevent this, it is of vital for road administrators to collect information and understand the road traffic problems. Then they should develop a plan to ensure appropriate road maintenance to develop appropriate and better road networks and public transportation. Traditionally, road traffic management has been using road sensors or surveillance cameras installed on the road to collect traffic information. Although the effectiveness of road sensors have been recognized by many road administrators, actual deployment has been delayed in many cases, due to higher installation costs. So now, probe car information system, a mechanism for collecting traffic information by using the car as a sensor, has been expected and recognized by the road administrators in terms of cost effectiveness. Hitachi has participated in the trial experiment to generate traffic information using taxis as probe cars in Hanoi city, and the evaluation of application of the probe car technology to the road traffic system has been performed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Experiments; Motor Transportation; Probes; Security Systems; Sensors; Traffic Congestion; Installation Costs; Public Transportation; Road Maintenance; Road Traffic Management; Road Traffic System; Surveillance Cameras; Technology Utilization; Traffic Information; Roads And Streets","Experiments; Motor transportation; Probes; Security systems; Sensors; Traffic congestion; Installation costs; Public transportation; Road maintenance; Road traffic management; Road traffic system; Surveillance cameras; Technology utilization; Traffic information; Roads and streets","","","","Hitachi Hyoron, (2006); undefined, (2011); Fushiki, Takumi, Formulation and validation of model for calculating the number of probe cars considering traffic information update frequency, IEEJ Transactions on Industry Applications, 126, 6, pp. 8-747, (2006); Li, Lan, Research on jam level variability utilizing the location information of traffic lights, 2, pp. 1503-1510, (2011)","","Intelligent Transportation Society of America","Bombardier; Bosch; et al.; Kapsch TrafficCom; Siemens; SWARCO","19th Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress, ITS 2012","","Vienna","101478","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896940331"

Our test sites are located at four districts of Quang Ninh province in the Northeast of Vietnam. Firstly, a field measurement were carried out in to measure water level, tree species, height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and crown diameter. Secondly, Soil sampling will be further carried out at the laboratory equipment by RCFEE. It was found that the water level has a few meters diurnal changes, the area covered by mainly four species of mangrove forests with homogeneous spatial distribution, height ranges from 0.6m to 5.0m, DBH from 5cm to 30cm and crown diameter from 0.7 to 1.6m. Allometric relationship between DBH and above ground biomass was retrieved via literature survey (Komiyama et al., 2008) and those equations are interpolated supplemented via field survey results. Then ALOS PALSAR HH and HV polarimetric backscatter coefficients are investigated and an above ground biomass of those area are estimated based on an allometric equation. By solving the allometric equations among PALSAR HV polarimetric image, tree height, DBH and above ground tree weight (AGW), AGW was mapped over the mangrove area. Estimated AGW values ranges from 6.4 (t/ha) at 2m-height tree to 16.0 (t/ha) at 5m-height tree. © 2011 KIEES. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dbh And Above Ground Biomass; Hh And Hv Polarimetric Backscatters; Above Ground Biomass; Allometric Equations; Allometric Relationship; Backscatter Coefficients; Crown Diameter; Diameter-at-breast Heights; Diurnal Changes; Field Measurement; Field Surveys; Hh And Hv Polarimetric Backscatters; Laboratory Equipments; Literature Survey; Mangrove Forest; Polarimetric Image; Soil Sampling; Test Site; Tree Height; Tree Species; Viet Nam; Backscattering; Biomass; Laboratories; Plants (botany); Polarimeters; Polarographic Analysis; Radar Measurement; Surveys; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Synthetic Apertures; Water Levels; Forestry; Forests; Mapping; Plants; Polarimetry; Radar; Vietnam","Above ground biomass; Allometric equations; Allometric relationship; Backscatter coefficients; Crown diameter; Diameter-at-breast heights; Diurnal changes; Field measurement; Field surveys; HH and HV polarimetric backscatters; Laboratory equipments; Literature survey; Mangrove forest; Polarimetric image; Soil sampling; Test site; Tree height; Tree species; Viet Nam; Backscattering; Biomass; Laboratories; Plants (botany); Polarimeters; Polarographic analysis; Radar measurement; Surveys; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic apertures; Water levels; Forestry; Forests; Mapping; Plants; Polarimetry; Radar; Vietnam","","","","Engheta, Nader, Radar Scattering from a Diffuse Vegetation Layer Over a Smooth Surface, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, GE-20, 2, pp. 212-216, (1982); FAO Forestry Paper 163, (2010); National Action Plan for Protection and Development of Vietnam S Mangrove Forests Until 2015, (2005); Mangrove Ecosystem in the Red River Coastal Zone, (2004); Komiyama, Akira, Allometry, biomass, and productivity of mangrove forests: A review, Aquatic Botany, 89, 2, pp. 128-137, (2008); Kristensen, Erik Qvist, Organic carbon dynamics in mangrove ecosystems: A review, Aquatic Botany, 89, 2, pp. 201-219, (2008); Report of Iriomote Forest Environment Protection Center, (2010); Lefsky, Michael Andrew, Estimates of forest canopy height and aboveground biomass using ICESat, Geophysical Research Letters, 32, 22, pp. 1-4, (2005); Proisy, Christophe, Interpretation of polarimetric radar signatures of mangrove forests, Remote Sensing of Environment, 71, 1, pp. 56-66, (2000)","","","Radar Society of KIEES; China Institute of Electronics (CIE), IEEE AESS, GRSS, IEICE; IEEE AESS, GRSS Korea Chapter; IEEE AESS, GRSS Beijing Chapter; IEEE GRSS Japan Chapter","2011 3rd International Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar, APSAR 2011","","Seoul","87713","","9788993246179","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-83755225812"

In this paper, we propose to combine PPM and MCM to create a novel modulation scheme, multi-code pulse position modulation (MCPPM). We then theoretically analyze the performance of the 2-D OCDMA system using MCPPM over a linear dispersive channel, while taking into account the negative impact of MAI, optical-beating interference (OBI), and receiver noise. It is seen that the use of MCPPM can simultaneously relax the effects of MAI, OBI, and dispersion.

The Natural Disaster Risk Management Project (NDRMP) adopts an innovative approach to disaster risk management in Vietnam and provides support for disaster prevention and mitigation measures at all levels of government, including at community level where vulnerability prevails. The CBDRM is one component of the NDRMP which aims at strengthening the capacity of villages and communes. It also aims at the disaster management institutions to become more responsive to the short term and longer term needs of the vulnerable communities through participatory risk assessment and identification, prioritization and implementation of risk reduction measures. The project intends to help communes implement activities that deal with natural hazards through capacity building in participatory planning and management. Safer village and commune plans that focus on long term intervention and preparedness measures were developed. The project has been building on existing community based disaster management and risk reduction models, and found empower flood prone communes to prevent and reduce the impact of disasters and secure and protect their livelihoods. The CBDRM activities directly support government efforts for sustainable development by helping reduce human, economic, and financial losses from disasters caused by nature in the target communes. In this chapter, the roles of the local communities, community facilitators, provincial level and central level were defined; this chapter also described how the CBDRM approach could be used to build the capacity of the most vulnerable populations to carry out risk mitigation measures at all levels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Community Based Disaster Management; Four On-the-spot Motto; Vietnam","","","","","Flood Emergency Management Strengthening Component 4 of the Mrc, (2007); National Progress Report on the Implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2007 2009, (2009); National Plan Implementation for the National Strategy on National Disaster Prevention Response and Mitigation to 2020, (2009); Four on the Spot Motto in Disaster Management, (2010); A Summary Report at the National Forum on Drr and Cca, (2009); Nguyen, Huy Duong, Water resource management, climate change and indigenous knowledge, pp. 59-72, (2009); A Book Chapter in Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction, (2010); Multisensor Approach to Evapotranspiration Mapping and Stream Model Validation in the Perfume River Basin Hue Vietnam, (2004); Multiple Dimension of Global Environmental Changes, (2006); City Profiles Hanoi Vietnam Climate Resilient Cities A Primer on Reducing Vulnerabilities to Disasters, (2009)","","Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","","","","","9781611227000; 9781611223033","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035065837"

A number of these sites have been excavated in recent years and they are often large mounds that can attain several meters in depth, comprising successive layers of alluvial soil brought in periodically to serve as living floors. The site of An Son is of this type and lies in a small valley immediately north of the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam. Excavated on five occasions since 1978, and most recently in 2009, it was occupied from the late third into the late second millennium b.c. An Son has produced evidence that attests the domestication of pigs and dogs in all layers apart (perhaps) from the most basal one, which was not investigated in 2009, together with the growing of rice of the subspecies Oryza sativa japonica, of Chinese Neolithic origin. The oldest pottery has simple incised and punctate zoned decoration with parallels in central Thailand, especially in the basal phases at Nong Nor and Khok Phanom Di. From its middle and later occupation phases (1800-1200 b.c.), An Son has produced a number of supine extended burials with finely decorated pottery grave goods that carry some unique forms, especially vessels with wavy or serrated rims. The An Son burials represent a Neolithic population that expressed a mixture of both indigenous Hoabinhian and more northerly (probably Neolithic southern Chinese) cranial and dental phenotypes, perhaps representing a likely ancestral population for some of the modern Austroasiatic-speaking populations of mainland Southeast Asia. © 2013 by the University of Hawai'i Press. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human Biological History; Neolithic; Prehistoric Food Production; Prehistoric Pottery; Vietnam; Cranium; Historical Perspective; Human Settlement; Neolithic; River Basin; Settlement History; Mekong Delta; Thailand; Viet Nam; Animalia; Canis Familiaris; Oryza Sativa (japonica Cultivar-group); Suidae","cranium; historical perspective; human settlement; Neolithic; river basin; settlement history; Mekong Delta; Thailand; Viet Nam; Animalia; Canis familiaris; Oryza sativa (japonica cultivar-group); Suidae","","","","Prehistory of the Indo Malaysian Archipelago, (1997); First Farmers, (2005); Bellwood, Peter S., Holocene population history in the pacific region as a model for worldwide food producer dispersals, Current Anthropology, 52, SUPPL. 4, pp. S363-S378, (2011); Global Perspective, (2013); Bellwood, Peter S., Austronesian cultural origins: Out of Taiwan, via the Batanes Islands, and onwards to Western Polynesia, pp. 23-39, (2008); Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, (1996); Bronk Ramsey, Christopher, Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates, Radiocarbon, 51, 1, pp. 337-360, (2009); Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology, (1997); Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains, (1994); Textile Technology in the Prehistory of Southeast Asia, (2002)","","University of Hawaii Press uhpjourn@hawaii.edu","","","","","","15358283; 00668435","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856616206"

This arises primarily due to the inability of β-lactam antibiotics to inhibit the transpeptidase activity of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). Effective inhibition of PBP2a to prevent the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis is of great importance for the treatment of a variety of clinically challenging infectious diseases caused by MRSA. To gain fundamental insights into the mode of covalent inhibition of the enzyme, we have carried out computational studies of the acylation reactions between small β-lactam molecules (methicilin and nitrocefin) and PBP2a using the B3LYP/6-31G* and ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31G:AMBER) hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical methods. Our calculations show that the acylation involves two transition states and that methicilin and nitrocefin undergo acylation in slightly different manners. The acylation of nitrocefin is more facile, which is attributed to the larger release of ring strain and the larger resonance stabilization gained upon ring opening. We suggest that, in addition to the nonbonded interactions between the ligand and the protein, these quantum chemical factors, which are associated with efficiency of the acylation step, should be taken into account and carefully controlled in designing novel β-lactam inhibitors of PBP2a. © 2011 American Chemical Society. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Meticillin; Nitrocefin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Cephalosporins; Methicillin; Penicillin-binding Proteins; Nitrocefin; Acylation; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biochemistry; Cell Membranes; Diseases; Health Risks; Molecular Modeling; Quantum Chemistry; Quantum Theory; Bacterial Resistance; Computational Studies; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Nonbonded Interaction; Pathogenic Bacterium; Penicillin- Binding Proteins; Quantum Mechanical/molecular Mechanical; Resonance Stabilization; Enzyme Inhibition; Antiinfective Agent; Cephalosporin Derivative; Meticillin; Nitrocefin; Penicillin Binding Protein; Acylation; Article; Chemical Structure; Chemistry; Drug Antagonism; Drug Effect; Enzyme Active Site; Enzymology; Metabolism; Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Penicillin Resistance; Thermodynamics; Anti-bacterial Agents; Catalytic Domain; Cephalosporins; Methicillin; Methicillin Resistance; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Models, Molecular; Penicillin-binding Proteins; Thermodynamics","Acylation; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biochemistry; Cell membranes; Diseases; Health risks; Molecular modeling; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Bacterial resistance; Computational studies; Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; Nonbonded interaction; Pathogenic bacterium; Penicillin- binding proteins; Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical; Resonance stabilization; Enzyme inhibition; antiinfective agent; cephalosporin derivative; meticillin; nitrocefin; penicillin binding protein; acylation; article; chemical structure; chemistry; drug antagonism; drug effect; enzyme active site; enzymology; metabolism; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; penicillin resistance; thermodynamics; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Catalytic Domain; Cephalosporins; Methicillin; Methicillin Resistance; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Models, Molecular; Penicillin-Binding Proteins; Thermodynamics","","meticillin, 132-92-3, 38882-79-0, 61-32-5; nitrocefin, 41906-86-9; Anti-Bacterial Agents, 0; Cephalosporins, 0; Methicillin, 61-32-5; Penicillin-Binding Proteins, 0; nitrocefin, 41906-86-9","","Wertheim, Heiman F.L., The role of nasal carriage in Staphylococcus aureus infections, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 5, 12, pp. 751-762, (2005); Frank, Daniel N., The human nasal microbiota and Staphylococcus aureus, PLOS ONE, 5, 5, (2010); Jevons, M.

In spite of its importance to tourism, no systematic analysis has been undertaken thus far to understand the perceptions of its residents toward tourism in their area. Guided by the Social Exchange Theory, this study investigated Cuc Phuong National Park (CPNP) residents' perceptions of tourism impacts and their support for tourism development in their areas. Additionally, the study also explored how demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, place of birth, marital status and level of education, household monthly income, job status and length of residency) explain residents' perceptions and their support. It was found that residents in general have positive perceptions towards the impacts brought by tourism in CPNP especially with regards to its social-cultural and environmental impacts and they strongly supported tourism development. However, these perceptions differ according to residents' socio-demographic characteristics. The study also revealed that residents' age and gender and their perceptions of tourism impacts could be predictors for their support for tourism development in CPNP.

Thus, allowing a system to predict how students would appraise certain feedback gives it the capability to adapt to what would help a student learn better. This research focuses on the prediction of a student's appraisal of feedback provided in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). A regression model for frustration and excitement is created to perform prediction. The frustration model was able to achieve a 0.724 correlation with a 0.164 RMSE and the excitement model was able to achieve 0.6 a correlation with a 0.189 RMSE.

Such features indeed comprise multiple modes such as orientations, scales, sparsity profiles. In order to extract features and classify multiway samples, most approaches vectorize data tensors to convert the classification of multiway data into the one of 1-D samples. This common approach disregards the multiway structures of global features, hence it can face the risk of losing correlation information between modes (orientations or scales). To this end, by revisiting the problem of scene classification in view of tensor decompositions, a new method is introduced to extract multiway features. The projection filter is designed for global features based on a set of basis matrices instead of only one basis as in 1-D problem. The proposed approach not only improves the classification accuracy, but also reduces the running time for training stage and feature projection. ©2010 IEEE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification Accuracy; Feature Projection; Global Feature; Multiple Modes; Running Time; Scene Classification; Tensor Decomposition; Data Handling; Tensors; Feature Extraction","Classification accuracy; Feature projection; Global feature; Multiple modes; Running time; Scene classification; Tensor decomposition; Data handling; Tensors; Feature extraction","","","","Computational Processes in Human Vision an Interdisciplinary Perspective, (1988); Oliva, Aude, Modeling the shape of the scene: A holistic representation of the spatial envelope, International Journal of Computer Vision, 42, 3, pp. 145-175, (2001); Torralba, A., Semantic organization of scenes using discriminant structural templates, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2, pp. 1253-1258, (1999); Lee, Tai Sing, Image representation using 2d gabor wavelets, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 18, 10, pp. 959-971, (1996); Cichocki, Andrzej S., Nonnegative Matrix and Tensor Factorizations: Applications to Exploratory Multi-Way Data Analysis and Blind Source Separation, pp. 1-477, (2009); Tucker, Ledyard R., Some mathematical notes on three-mode factor analysis, Psychometrika, 31, 3, pp. 279-311, (1966); Perception Systemes Et Information, (2005); Phan, Anh Huy, Fast and efficient algorithms for nonnegative Tucker decomposition, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5264 LNCS, PART 2, pp. 772-782, (2008); Iconip, (2009); Neurocomputing, (2010)","","","IEEE; IEEE Communications Society; REV; VNU HCMC; ICT","2010 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications, ATC 2010","","Ho Chi Minh City","83502","","9781424488766","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78751535989"

Remoteness, low literacy, and lack of formal planning experience often leave forest communities unprepared for their new responsibilities. Forest communities need to develop skills that allow them to establish goals and make decisions transparently and democratically and to negotiate effectively with other local actors if they are to become more proactive participants in local governance processes. In Bolivia and Vietnam we tested four adaptations of scenario-based methods to assist forest communities to develop these skills. This article reflects on the strengths, limitations, and new applications of these methods. The methods encourage participation by members who have little experience with structured planning, including the most marginalized: women, elderly, and illiterate participants. The methods are useful as planning tools, for generating records of decision-making processes, and for preparing for negotiations between communities and local governments. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bolivia; Decentralization; Forest Devolution; Forest-dependent Communities; Future Scenarios; Participatory Methods; Vietnam; Community Forestry; Decentralization; Decision Making; Forest Management; Governance Approach; Local Government; Local Participation; Participatory Approach; Bolivia; Viet Nam","community forestry; decentralization; decision making; forest management; governance approach; local government; local participation; participatory approach; Bolivia; Viet Nam","","","The research leading to this article was financially supported by SDC (Switzerland) and BMZ (Germany).

Hong Ngu and Sa Dec District in Dong Thap Province, Tan Chau and Long Xuyen District in An Giang Province along Tien and Hau River have suffered from serious erosions with average speed from 5 to 30m per year which has taken away hundreds of hectares of farming land, houses and has damaged many schools, hospitals, offices and main roads (Quang Hai, 2008). This has caused a lot of difficulties for governmental planning, seriously affected the life of citizens and also the development of the local economy. Therefore, the study of the statistical data, change rates and the direction of the movement of riverbanks is necessary to predict the future changes in the riverbanks of Tien and Hau River which will happen in the future. Consequently, the aim of this research is using remote sensing data which is known as an effective and fast technology to analyze the phenomenal hazard in the riverbanks. For this purpose, multi-temporal optical and radar satellite images (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, ASTER, and ERS-2) from 1989 to 2009 have been used. In addition to this topographical maps of the area were also used to provide the base map from 1966-1968 before the advent of remote sensing technique. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software was applied for analyzing rate and predicting riverbank changes in next 5 and 10 years. The results for Sa Dec, Hong Ngu District are presented as hot spots showing the speed of erosion (reached to 50m per year) and were forecasted to erode from 100 to 520m in next 10 years. Moreover according to Vietnam Southern Regional Hydro-meteorological Center news, Mekong Delta in year 2010 has suffered the lowest water level in 20 years because of the El-Niño phenomenon. Thus riverbanks of this area which will be changed more complicated should be detected instantly by remote sensing data. For that reason this research will continue updating riverbank information by using ALOS AVNIR and PRISM data acquired in 2010. The results are helpful in building more appropriate future planning strategies in order to protect the region and plan more effectively. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Change; Linear Regression; Remote Sensing; Riverbank; Erosion; Geodetic Satellites; Linear Regression; Rivers; Water Levels; Change; Direction Of The Movement; Multi-temporal Remote Sensing; Remote Sensing Data; Remote Sensing Techniques; Riverbank; Statistical Datas; Topographical Maps; Remote Sensing","Erosion; Geodetic satellites; Linear regression; Rivers; Water levels; Change; Direction of the movement; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing techniques; Riverbank; Statistical datas; Topographical maps; Remote sensing","","","","Genz, Ayesha S., The predictive accuracy of shoreline change rate methods and alongshore beach variation on Maui, Hawaii, Journal of Coastal Research, 23, 1, pp. 87-105, (2007); GIS Development Asia, (2002); Proceeding of Asian Conference on GIS GPS Aerial Photography and Remote Sensing, (2002); Report Research Tien Riverbanks Changes in Tan Chau Hong Ngu Islet and Thanh Binh Dong Thap Province Based on Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data Dectecting Continuing from 2008 and 2009, (2009); Report Research on Predicting Prevending the Erosion Riverbanks of Mekong River, (2001); U S Geological Survey Open File Report 2008 1278, (2009); Report Detecting the Riverbanks Change in Tra Vinh Province Based on Multi Temporal Remote Sensing Data from 1989 1996 2003, (2005); Shoreline Change Analysis and Its Application to Prediction A Remote Sensing and Statistics Based Approach, (2008); Geography","Kajiwara, K.; Muramatsu, K.; Ono, A.; Soyama, N.; Endo, T.; Akatsuka, S.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium on Networking the World with Remote Sensing","","Kyoto","111060","16821750","9781629935126; 9781629934297; 9781629935201","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84918580608"

Our analysis used four household surveys conducted in Vietnam between 1992 and 2004. With the highly detailed 1997-1998 survey, we found that 73.1 percent of Vietnamese elderly are living with children and 34.8 percent were either receiving remittances directly or married to a recipient. From our logistic regression analysis, we determined further that living with children and remittances both serve continuing roles for elderly support, and our findings suggest that expanding the pension system in Vietnam can potentially play an important role in reducing elderly poverty without crowding out these other support mechanisms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Elderly Population; Household Survey; Migrants Remittance; Pension System; Poverty Alleviation; Regression Analysis; Social Policy; Welfare Provision; Viet Nam","elderly population; household survey; migrants remittance; pension system; poverty alleviation; regression analysis; social policy; welfare provision; Viet Nam","","","","Reconfiguring Families in Contemporary Vietnam, (2009); Population Studies Center, (1999); Journal of International Women S Studies, (2001); Gender and Intergenerational Exchange in Vietnam, (2002); General Introduction of Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey 2002 Vhlss2002, (2004); Mimeo, (2004); Giangb, Thanh Long, Ageing, poverty and the role of a social pension in Vietnam, Development and Change, 40, 2, pp. 333-360, (2009); Giang, Long Thanh, Vulnerability of vietnamese elderly to poverty: Determinants and policy implications, Asian Economic Journal, 23, 4, pp. 419-437, (2009); Social Issues Under Economic Transformation and Integration in Vietnam, (2007); Social Issues Under Economic Transformation and Integration in Vietnam, (2007)","","Scalabrini Migration Center claims@sagepub.com","","","","","","01171968","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951833078"

Design/methodology/approach - Urban development and disaster management policies were analyzed and key stakeholders were interviewed to discover the effectiveness of the policies and governance tasks. Findings - A discrepancy was identified between the goals of urban development and disaster management. The negative side of this discrepancy has been amplified by ineffective Construction Regulations and a lack of specificity with regard to Ordinances on Dyke. These factors, combined with poor coordination and lack of motivation within the city authorities in managing the Riverside Urban Areas (RUA), have contributed to the over-development, which consists primarily of squatting and illegal construction. Research limitations/implications - Along with a consideration of community perception of catastrophic flood risk in the RUA, which has been examined, the paper further analyses the effectiveness of related policies for catastrophic risk reduction in the RUA. Practical implications - The paper identifies the following effective measures: build and share a knowledge base concerning catastrophic flood risk and sustainable ways of coping with the flood; be responsible and develop a commitment to manage flood-prone areas; and develop better coordination between urban development and flood management. Originality/value - The paper suggests new policy standards for managing the RUA development and reducing flood risks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disasters; Floods; Risk Management","","","","","Boullé, Philippe, Vulnerability reduction for sustainable urban development, Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 5, 3, pp. 179-188, (1997); Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, (2006); Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control, (2004); Journal of Construction Planning, (2004); Presentation on the Hanoi Master Plan for 2020, (1997); Proceeding of the Unu Uncrd Regional Workshop, (2003); A Set of Compiling Articles of Housing and Urban Issues in Hanoi Moi Tuoi Tre Thu do Dai Doan Ket and Kinh Te do Thi Newspapers from 1983 to 2005, (2005); Disaster Prevention and Management, (2010); Thang Long Hanoi Ten Centuries of Urbanization, (1995); European Journal of East Asian Studies, (2004)","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","09653562; 17586100","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-76549126390"

All data were collected from medical files in Japan, and from medical files and self-administered questionnaires in Vietnam. The proportion of mothers without secure feeling of confidence in the present study was 22% in Japan and 66% in Vietnam. Significant factors associated with a lack of confidence were first-time motherhood and unintended pregnancy in the Japanese dataset and younger age in the Vietnamese dataset. In both groups, a higher proportion of mothers who lacked confidence reported negative parenting outcomes than did confident mothers. Among the three psychological measurements (mood, self-efficacy and depression), higher self-efficacy was associated independently with a significantly reduced risk of not having confidence in child rearing. These results suggest the importance of developing parenting support programs to help Japanese and Vietnamese mothers, particularly those who are young, first-time mothers or who became pregnant unexpectedly, improve their self-efficacy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child Rearing; Japan; Maternal Confidence; Self-efficacy; Vietnam","","","","Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Dr. Pham Viet Thanh, Director of Tu Du Obstetrical and Gynecological Hospital for providing permission to conduct this study.

The value chain analysis is used to prove that the additional approach can overcome the weaknesses of the main current approaches such as the one-stop service centers and customer management relationship. However, this incorporation is challenged due to the differences between governments and businesses. The value chain analysis assists to find out solutions, which are specialization into a single or group of related services and commercialization allowing the participation of the private sector in carrying e-government initiatives, in order to create the sufficient pre-conditions for integration of e-business models.

Compared to the conventional LRA MMSE detector, the proposed detector achieves much closer BER performances to those for the ML detector in both the 4×4 MIMO and the 8×8 MIMO systems. ©2009 IEEE. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gram-schmidt Orthogonalization; Lattice-reduction; Lll Algorithm; Mimo; Mmse; Signal Estimation; Ber Performance; Channel Matrices; Column Vector; Decision Boundary; Gram-schmidt; Gram-schmidt Orthogonalizations; Lattice-reduction; Lattice-reduction Aided Detection; Lll Algorithm; Mimo Channel; Ml Detections; Ml Detectors; Mmse Detection; Mmse Detectors; Signal Estimation; Algorithms; Man Machine Systems; Mimo Systems; Multiplexing; Signal Analysis; Signal Detection; Detectors","BER performance; Channel matrices; Column vector; Decision boundary; Gram-schmidt; Gram-Schmidt orthogonalizations; Lattice-reduction; Lattice-reduction aided detection; LLL algorithm; MIMO channel; ML detections; ML detectors; MMSE detection; MMSE detectors; Signal estimation; Algorithms; Man machine systems; MIMO systems; Multiplexing; Signal analysis; Signal detection; Detectors","","","","Lenstra, Arjen K., Factoring polynomials with rational coefficients, Mathematische Annalen, 261, 4, pp. 515-534, (1982); Nguyen, Tien Duc, Layer error characteristics of lattice-reduction aided V-BLAST detectors, IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Sciences, E89-A, 10, pp. 2535-2542, (2006); Wübben, Dirk, Near-maximum-likelihood detection of MIMO systems using MMSE-based lattice-reduction, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, 2, pp. 798-802, (2004); Wang, Xinglin, An improved detection based on lattice reduction in MIMO systems, IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, PIMRC, (2006); Yao, Huan, Lattice-reduction-aided detectors for MIMO communication systems, 1, pp. 424-428, (2002); Clarkson, Kenneth L., Fast multiple-antenna differential decoding, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 49, 2, pp. 253-261, (2001); Windpassinger, Christoph A., Low-complexity near-maximum-likelihood detection and precoding for MIMO systems using lattice reduction, pp. 345-348, (2003); Hassibi, Babak, An efficient square-root algorithm for BLAST, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2, pp. 737-740, (2000); Fujino, Tadashi, Combined forward and backward lattice reduction aided MMSE detection in MIMO systems, IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, (2008); Fujino, Tadashi, A combined forward and backward lattice-reduction aided MMSE list detection, pp. 39-44, (2008)","","","","2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications, ATC 2009","","Hai Phong","79085","","9781424451395","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-74549169945"

Various antenna selection algorithms based on different criteria have been proposed in the literature. This paper presents a new antenna selection algorithm for MIMO spatial division multiplexing (MIMO-SDM) systems which uses the mean square error (MSE) as a criterion for selecting the best subset of transmit/receive antennas to improve the system error performance. The proposed algorithm helps to achieve lower the bit error rate (BER) for MIMO-SDM systems with linear detectors compared with the previous channel matrix norm based and signal to noise ratio (SNR) based selection algorithms. Compared with the SNR based algorithm, the proposed algorithm provides double diversity gain in receive antenna selection systems and the same diversity order but about 1dB SNR gain in transmit antenna selection systems. ©2009 IEEE. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antenna Selection; Antenna Selection Algorithms; Channel Matrices; Diversity Gain; Diversity Order; Linear Detectors; Low Costs; Multiple-input-multiple-output Systems; Performance Improvements; Receive Antenna Selection; Selection Algorithm; Snr Gains; Spatial Division Multiplexing; System Errors; Transmit Antenna Selection; Algorithms; Bit Error Rate; Communication Channels (information Theory); Mean Square Error; Multiplexing; Signal Processing; Signal To Noise Ratio; Space Division Multiple Access; Strain Energy; Receiving Antennas","Antenna selection; Antenna selection algorithms; Channel matrices; Diversity gain; Diversity order; Linear detectors; Low costs; Multiple-input-multiple-output systems; Performance improvements; Receive antenna selection; Selection algorithm; SNR gains; Spatial Division Multiplexing; System errors; Transmit antenna selection; Algorithms; Bit error rate; Communication channels (information theory); Mean square error; Multiplexing; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Space division multiple access; Strain energy; Receiving antennas","","","","Foschini, Gerrard J., On Limits of Wireless Communications in a Fading Environment when Using Multiple Antennas, Wireless Personal Communications, 6, 3, pp. 311-335, (1998); Wolniansky, Peter W., V-BLAST: an architecture for realizing very high data rates over the rich-scattering wireless channel, Conference Proceedings of the International Symposium on Signals, Systems and Electronics, pp. 295-300, (1998); van Nee, Richard D.J., Maximum likelihood decoding in a space division multiplexing system, IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, 1, pp. 6-10, (2000); Berenguer, Inaki, MIMO antenna selection with lattice-reduction-aided linear receivers, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 53, 5, pp. 1289-1302, (2004); Isap 05 2005 International Symposium on Antenna and Propagation, (2005); Sanayei, Shahab, Antenna selection in MIMO systems, IEEE Communications Magazine, 42, 10, pp. 68-73, (2004); Heath Jr., Robert W., Antenna selection for spatial multiplexing systems with linear receivers, IEEE Communications Letters, 5, 4, pp. 142-144, (2001); Proceedings of International ITG IEEE Workshop on Smart Antennas, (2005); Lu, Di, Performance based receive antenna selection for V-BLAST systems, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 8, 1, pp. 214-225, (2009); Microwave Mobile Communications, (1974)","","","","2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications, ATC 2009","","Hai Phong","79085","","9781424451395","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-74549155132"

However, from the viewpoint of economic theory the overall impacts of remittances are uncertain, as different mechanisms lead to opposite impacts. Since the 1990s Vietnam has experienced a dramatic growth in remittance flows from abroad. Vietnam is a unique case for study, as economic motives historically played a smaller role in outward migration than in other countries. Fortunately, household survey data are available for this time period, allowing for a detailed analysis of the impacts of international remittances on Vietnam. Specifically, we examine the characteristics of recipients and the impacts of international remittances on economic inequality and poverty. We conclude that international remittances are helping to improve equality. For this reason, new development policies must also account for their potential impacts on remittance flows. © UNESCO 2010. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Development Indicator; Economic Development; Economic Growth; Household Survey; Policy Development; Population Migration; Poverty Alleviation; Remittance; Welfare Impact; Article; Economics; Ethnology; Family Health; Family Size; History; Hospital Service; Income; Legal Aspect; Poverty; Psychological Aspect; Social Problem; Social Status; Social Welfare; Viet Nam; Family Characteristics; Family Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Housekeeping; Income; Poverty; Social Conditions; Social Problems; Social Welfare; Vietnam","development indicator; economic development; economic growth; household survey; policy development; population migration; poverty alleviation; remittance; welfare impact; article; economics; ethnology; family health; family size; history; hospital service; income; legal aspect; poverty; psychological aspect; social problem; social status; social welfare; Viet Nam; Family Characteristics; Family Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Housekeeping; Income; Poverty; Social Conditions; Social Problems; Social Welfare; Vietnam","","","","undefined, (1991); undefined, (2007); Adams, Richard H., Do international migration and remittances reduce poverty in developing countries?, World Development, 33, 10, pp. 1645-1669, (2005); undefined, (2006); Barbieri, Magali, Demographic trends in Vietnam., Population.

The authors simulate changes in the poverty rate, poverty gap and poverty severity of the elderly in the counterfactual situation that such a scheme had been introduced to Vietnam in the past. They consider a number of categorical targeting groups of elderly people along with various transfer parameters to assess the impacts of the scheme on social welfare. They conclude that, depending on the characteristics of the social pension, there would be beneficial poverty reductions, but also large leakages to the non-poor people. For a variety of measures, the results suggest that targeting the elderly in rural areas might be the most effective use of limited resources. Simulations for different budgetary constraints show that, even with limited budgeting, a social pension scheme would significantly reduce poverty incidence for the elderly. Furthermore, for a given programme cost, combining lower benefits with lower eligibility requirements is more effective at reducing poverty than providing larger benefits to a more limited group of recipients. © 2009 Institute of Social Studies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aging; Elderly Population; Pension System; Poverty; Poverty Alleviation; Welfare Provision; Asia; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","aging; elderly population; pension system; poverty; poverty alleviation; welfare provision; Asia; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","","","","Non Contributory Pensions and Poverty Reduction in Brazil and South Africa, (2005); Barrientos, Armando, Poverty reduction: The missing piece of pension reform in Latin America, Social Policy and Administration, 40, 4, pp. 369-384, (2006); Non Contributory Pensions and Social Protection, (2002); Estimates for Poverty Alleviation in South Africa with an Application to A Universal Income Grant, (2003); Deaton, Angus S., The analysis of household surveys: a microeconomic approach to development policy, (1998); Cash Benefits in Low Income Countries Simulating the Effects on Poverty Reduction for Senegal and Tanzania, (2006); Household Living Standard Survey 2004, (2007); Social Issues Under Economic Transformation and Integration in Vietnam, (2007); Social Issues Under Economic Transformation and Integration in Vietnam, (2007); Giangb, Thanh Long, An exploration for a universal non-contributory pension scheme in Vietnam, pp. 140-164, (2009)","","","","","","","","0012155X; 14677660","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649576956"

Yet there have been few studies conducted in Southeast Asian countries. This article surveys arsenic contamination in groundwater and residents from Vietnam, and is based on our previous studies. Samples of groundwater (n = 118), human hair (n = 59), and urine (n = 100) were collected in the Red River and Mekong River Deltas during 2001-2004. Arsenic was detected in most of the groundwater samples, and its level ranged from <0.1 to 486 μg/l. Elevated concentrations of arsenic were observed in groundwater at some locations in Ha Nam (up to 486 μg/l) in the Red River Delta and Dong Thap (up to 411 μg/l) in the Mekong River Delta. Remarkably, about 33% of these groundwater samples exceeded the WHO drinking water guideline of 10 μg/l. These results suggest that arsenic contamination in groundwater may be widely present in both the Red River and Mekong River Deltas, Vietnam. A significant positive correlation was observed between arsenic concentrations in groundwater and human hair. Arsenic speciation of human urine revealed the presence of inorganic arsenic, and these concentrations positively correlated with arsenic levels in groundwater. Thus, it is likely that residents in our study areas are chronically exposed to arsenic through drinking groundwater, suggesting that there is a health risk from arsenic in Vietnam. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arsenic; Groundwater; Human; Mekong River Delta; Red River Delta; Vietnam; Arsenic Concentration; Arsenic Contamination; Arsenic Levels; Arsenic Speciation; Asian Countries; Drinking Water; Elevated Concentrations; Environmental Problems; Groundwater Contamination; Human; Human Exposures; Human Hair; Human Urine; Inorganic Arsenic; Mekong River; Mekong River Delta; Positive Correlations; Red River; Red River Delta; Study Areas; Vietnam; Arsenic; Body Fluids; Coastal Zones; Groundwater; Groundwater Pollution; Health Risks; Hydrogeology; Potable Water; Rivers; River Pollution","Arsenic concentration; Arsenic contamination; Arsenic levels; Arsenic speciation; Asian countries; Drinking water; Elevated concentrations; Environmental problems; Groundwater contamination; Human; Human exposures; Human hair; Human urine; Inorganic arsenic; Mekong River; Mekong River Delta; Positive correlations; Red River; Red River Delta; Study areas; Vietnam; Arsenic; Body fluids; Coastal zones; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Health risks; Hydrogeology; Potable water; Rivers; River pollution","","","","Nordstrom, Darrell Kirk, Worldwide occurrences of arsenic in ground water, Science, 296, 5576, pp. 2143-2145, (2002); Smedley, Pauline L., A review of the source, behaviour and distribution of arsenic in natural waters, Applied Geochemistry, 17, 5, pp. 517-568, (2002); Wu, Meei Maan, Dose-response relation between arsenic concentration in well water and mortality from cancers and vascular diseases, American Journal of Epidemiology, 130, 6, pp. 1123-1132, (1989); Tondel, Martin, The relationship of arsenic levels in drinking water and the prevalence rate of skin lesions in Bangladesh, Environmental Health Perspectives, 107, 9, pp. 727-729, (1999); Berg, Michael, Arsenic contamination of groundwater and drinking water in Vietnam: A human health threat, Environmental Science and Technology, 35, 13, pp. 2621-2626, (2001); Trang, Pham Thi Kim, Bacterial bioassay for rapid and accurate analysis of arsenic in highly variable groundwater samples, Environmental Science and Technology, 39, 19, pp. 7625-7630, (2005); Kubota, Reiji, Urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in inhabitants chronically exposed to arsenic in groundwater in Cambodia, Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 8, 2, pp. 293-299, (2006); Shinkai, Yasuhiro, Arsenic and other metal contamination of groundwater in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam, Journal of Health Science, 53, 3, pp. 344-346, (2007); Biomedical Research on Trace Elements, (2004); Biomedical Research on Trace Elements, (2005)","","","","","","","","10290400; 00207233","","IJEVA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-69149105860"

E-waste scrap generated in Asia is recycled in China, especially in Guangdong Province. The informal sector in that province has been recycling E-waste scrap and its improper recycling methods have caused serious pollution. In response to this problem, there is wide support for a total ban on E-waste trade, including secondhand items and E-waste scrap. Alternatively, we recommend the establishment of an alternative proper recycling system in Asia that needs cooperation among all Asian countries. First, China is urged to promote proper domestic recycling activities by providing a subsidy for proper recycling.

The data sources for the study compose of historical maps, recent maps, and various satellite images acquired from 1975 to 2005 (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, JERS, ASTER, IKONOS and QuickBird). The main techniques used in our image processing are NDVI and Water Index, combined with a decision-tree classification for medium resolution images (Landsat and ASTER). High resolution images (IKONOS and QuickBird) were used to validate the signature of land use classes and to verify certain urban construction features. The analysis showed that the spatial growth of Hanoi is limited by natural barriers, such as streams to the northeast and east, water bodies to the north, and a swamp area to the south. The expansion of Hanoi stretches in four directions South, Southwest, West and East following main transportation axes connecting the inner city to neighboring areas. Both spatial expansion and in-fill expansion took place in the urbanization of Hanoi. It is important to relate the urban transition with social-economic mile stones of the city and to find correlations between remote sensing derived maps and indices with other statistics such as population, population density, road and housing densities, but these have not been included in our present work. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Housing Density; Land Use Change; Physical Features; Remote Sensing; Spatial Expansion; Urbanization; Vegetation Index; Gis; Image Classification; Image Resolution; Land Use Change; Ndvi; Population Density; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Twentieth Century; Urban Planning; Urbanization; Vegetation Index; Hanoi; Viet Nam","GIS; image classification; image resolution; land use change; NDVI; population density; remote sensing; satellite imagery; twentieth century; urban planning; urbanization; vegetation index; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","","International Work Shop on Asian Approach Toward Sustainable Urban Regeneration, (2004); Urban Transition in Vietnam, (2002); Proceedings of the 1st Earsel Workshop of the Sig Urban Remote Sensing, (2006); Hanoi Master Plan to the Year 2020, (2003); Jensen, John Robert, Introductory digital image processing: a remote sensing perspective.

It is also shown that the achieved BER curve moves closer to the curve of the ML detector than that of the conventional LRA MMSE detector. © 2008 IEEE. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lattice-reduction; Lll Algorithm; Mimo; Mmse; Signal Estimation; Decoding; Detectors; Estimation; Man Machine Systems; Mimo Systems; Multiplexing; Signal Analysis; Lattice-reduction; Lll Algorithm; Mimo; Mmse; Signal Estimation; Mim Devices","Decoding; Detectors; Estimation; Man machine systems; MIMO systems; Multiplexing; Signal analysis; Lattice-reduction; LLL algorithm; MIMO; MMSE; Signal estimation; MIM devices","","","","Lenstra, Arjen K., Factoring polynomials with rational coefficients, Mathematische Annalen, 261, 4, pp. 515-534, (1982); Nguyen, Tien Duc, Layer error characteristics of lattice-reduction aided V-BLAST detectors, IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Sciences, E89-A, 10, pp. 2535-2542, (2006); Wübben, Dirk, Near-maximum-likelihood detection of MIMO systems using MMSE-based lattice-reduction, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, 2, pp. 798-802, (2004); Wang, Xinglin, An improved detection based on lattice reduction in MIMO systems, IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, PIMRC, (2006); Yao, Huan, Lattice-reduction-aided detectors for MIMO communication systems, 1, pp. 424-428, (2002); Clarkson, Kenneth L., Fast multiple-antenna differential decoding, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 49, 2, pp. 253-261, (2001); Windpassinger, Christoph A., Low-complexity near-maximum-likelihood detection and precoding for MIMO systems using lattice reduction, pp. 345-348, (2003); Hassibi, Babak, An efficient square-root algorithm for BLAST, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2, pp. 737-740, (2000); Fujino, Tadashi, Combined forward and backward lattice reduction aided MMSE detection in MIMO systems, IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, (2008)","","","","2008 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications, ATC 2008","","Hanoi","75765","","9781424426812","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-63149112726"

An intervention group and a control group (consisting of 150 and 154 community leaders, respectively) were both evaluated, after the intervention group took part in a 5-day participatory-style educational program. Healthy living environment promotion competency (HPC) was evaluated by an instrument consisted of four competency areas: identifying the steps required for a healthy living environment; understanding the principles to reduce potential health risks; providing public health management to improve the living environment; and applying the principles of health communication skills. Scores between the intervention and control groups were examined to identify changes between the baseline and post-intervention periods. A qualitative evaluation of the educational program by participants and facilitators was conducted to assess the appropriateness of the intervention. The results indicated significant increases in the total HPC score and scores of individual HPC competency areas in the intervention group. Thus, the effectiveness of a capacity building program for community leaders in a healthy living environment was demonstrated. Qualitative evaluation revealed that the participatory-style and intersectoral collaboration approach facilitated the educational process. Community leaders, who are representatives of various sectors and mass organizations within the community, can be important implementers in the promotion of a healthy living environment. © The Author (2008).

The Duoi U'Oi cave is located in Man Duc village, 25 km of Hoà Binh city in northern Vietnam. It belongs to a karstic network developed in a dark grey micritic marine limestone dated from the Lower to the Middle Triassic. The sedimentary fill produced a rich mammalian fauna, essentially composed of isolated teeth of middle- to large-sized mammals (Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Proboscidea, Carnivora, Rodentia, Primates), and characteristic of Late Pleistocene. The results of the Duoi U'Oi fieldwork are of great interest for the following reasons: (1) the biochronological age of the fauna is consistent with 230Th/234U/238U dating from the calcitic floors (66±3 ka). The Duoi U'Oi fauna is thus the oldest well-dated modern fauna known for the Southeast Asian mainland; (2) in terms of sedimentology, the analysis of the formation of the fossiliferous breccia and that of the processes of deposits shows a close relation between the karstic deposits inside the cave and the deposits in the alluvial terraces. The observation of three levels of alluvial terraces associated with three caves situated at 62, 10 and 3 m above the present alluvial plain suggests that exokarstic and endokarstic sediments evolved together; (3) in terms of palaeobiogeography, Duoi U'Oi is the continental fauna showing the strongest resemblance with the Late Pleistocene faunas from Indonesian islands (Punung, Gunung Dawung, Lida Ajer, Sibrambang and Djambu caves); this implies that, at the time of Duoi U'Oi, ca 70 ka, the Sundaland was mainly characterised by faunas of modern aspect; (4) the analysis of major taphonomic factors that led to the mammal assemblage reveals a combination of selective agents (selective role of predators and porcupines, selective destruction of age classes for some species, selective preservation of fossils due to the deposition processes in the karstic network), which contribute to the poor representation of the diversity of the fauna; no arguments show that humans, present at Duoi U'Oi, might have a possible role in the taphonomic process; (5) the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on the composition of the faunal assemblage suggests a forested area and some open habitats, under warm and humid conditions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The material culture from this site belongs to the pre-ceramic Hoabinhian period. An AMS radiocarbon date on a tooth sample extracted from this individual gives a calibrated age of 10450 ± 300 years BP. In discussions of the population history of Southeast Asia, it has been repeatedly advocated that Southeast Asia was occupied by indigenous people akin to present-day Australo-Melanesians prior to the Neolithic expansion of migrants from Northeast Asia into the area. Cranial and dental metric analyses were undertaken in order to assess the biological affinity of early settlers in this region. The results suggest that the Hang Cho skeleton, as well as other early or pre-Holocene remains in Southeast Asia, represent descendants of colonizing populations of late Pleistocene Sundaland, who may share a common ancestry with present-day Australian Aboriginal and Melanesian people. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ams Dating; Biological Affinity; Hang Cho; Hoabinhian; Skeleton; Southeast Asia; Vietnam","","","","","Prehistoric Hunter Gatherers in Japan New Research Methods, (1986); Ambrose, Stanley H., Preparation and characterization of bone and tooth collagen for isotopic analysis, Journal of Archaeological Science, 17, 4, pp. 431-451, (1990); Barnett, C.

This paper discusses the impacts of FTAs on the Indonesian economy, particularly for economic growth, poverty, and income distribution. By using a Global Computable General Equilibrium (GCGE) model, we conducted the simulation analysis by setting eighteen scenarios for the ongoing and potential FTAs of different frameworks. Indonesia is found to benefit from joining in FTAs, except for the FTA with India. It is also implied that FTAs increase rural household income at higher rates than they increase urban household income. Moreover, FTAs' impacts are more favorable for unskilled workers than for skilled ones, and also for relatively poor households more than for rich households, both in urban and rural areas. In brief, FTAs provide Indonesia with income redistribution effects. © The Applied Regional Science Conference (ARSC)/Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. 2007. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bilateral Agreement; Economic Growth; Economic Impact; Economic Integration; Free Trade Area; Household Income; Income Distribution; Regional Economy; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Southeast Asia","bilateral agreement; economic growth; economic impact; economic integration; Free Trade Area; household income; income distribution; regional economy; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Southeast Asia","","","","Workshop on Why Trade and Industry Policy Matters, (2003); Mirage A Computable General Equilibrium Model for Trade Policy Analysis, (2002); National Social Economic Survey Susenas, (2000); Statistical Yearbook of Indonesia, (2007); Regional Economic Integration and Its Impacts on Growth Poverty and Income Distribution the Case of Thailand, (2006); Derviş, Kemal, General equilibrium models for development policy., (1982); Dfat East Asia Analytical Unit, (2000); Indonesia S Trade Policy and Performance an Overview, (2001); Global Trade Analysis Modeling and Applications, (1997); Workshop on Why Trade and Industry Policy Matters, (2004)","","","","","","","","1467940X; 09170553","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36349010071"

This paper presents the results of an experiment in which a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based NER model is applied to the Vietnamese language. Though this state of the art machine learning method has been widely applied to NER in several well-studied languages, this is the first time this method has been applied to Vietnamese. In a comparison against Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) the SVM model was shown to outperform CRF by optimizing its feature window size, obtaining an overall F-score of 87.75. The paper also presents a detailed discussion about the characteristics of the Vietnamese language and provides an analysis of the factors which influence performance in this task. © 2007 National Instiute of Informatics. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Named Entity Recognition (ner); Support Vector Machine (svm); Text Mining; Language Processing; Named Entity Recognition (ner); Text Mining; Data Mining; Mathematical Models; Optimization; Random Variables; Support Vector Machines; Image Recognition","Language processing; Named Entity Recognition (NER); Text mining; Data mining; Mathematical models; Optimization; Random variables; Support vector machines; Image recognition","","","","Dinh, Dien H., A maximum entropy approach for Vietnamese word segmentation, pp. 248-253, (2006); Proceedings of the 39th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, (2001); Mayfield, James C., Named Entity Recognition using Hundreds of Thousands of Features, pp. 184-187, (2003); Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, (2002); Icml, (2001); Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Natural Language Learning, (2002); 8th Conference on Some Selection Problems of Information Technology and Telecommunication, (2005); Proceedings of the 7th Message Understanding Conference Muc 7, (1997); Florian, Radu, Named Entity Recognition through Classifier Combination, pp. 168-171, (2003); Kudo, Taku, Chunking with support vector machines, (2001)","","","","","","","","13498614; 13498606","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-34249750530"

Results gave the following Δ14C time series: a steady state of -47.8 ± 2.8‰ (mean ± SD, n = 8) during 1948- 1955 (i.e. in the pre-bomb period); a sharp increase during 1956-1966; a gradual increase during 1967-1973; a relatively high maximum value of ~174‰ in 1973; and a gradual decrease for the following period to ~86‰ in 1999. This Δ14C record having a sharp increase and a relatively high peak is similar to the records of subtropical corals (latitudes 21-27°) and is distinctly different from the records of equatorial/tropical corals (latitudes <10°), although our coral sample was collected from an equatorial/tropical region (8°39′N, 106°33′E). This can be explained by the geographic, oceanographic, and climatic setting of our study site. The SCS is a semi-enclosed marginal sea in the far western tropical Pacific and is little influenced by equatorial upwelling or related ocean currents. Our study site is located in the southwestern SCS, where an enormous submerged plain (the Sunda Shelf) spreads out with very shallow waters (mean depth <100 m). Furthermore, in the SCS, the East Asian monsoon (a strong, seasonally reversing wind system) enhances air-sea gas exchange especially in the mainland coastal waters, including our study site. Such semi-enclosed shallow waters with enhanced ventilation were probably very sensitive to the atmospheric nuclear explosions in the late 1950s and early 1960s and caused the sharp increase and high peak in the coral Δ14C record. Our coral Δ14C values in the southwestern SCS are significantly higher than the values in the northwestern SCS (Xisha Islands), which seems to suggest that meridional mixing of surface waters is not active in the SCS and that the open-ocean water intruding into the northern SCS (i.e. the Kuroshio intrusion) has only a limited influence on the southern SCS. © 2007 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthozoa; Porites","Anthozoa; Porites","","","","Barnes, David J., On the nature and causes of luminescent lines and bands in coral skeletons, Coral Reefs, 19, 3, pp. 221-230, (2001); Buddemeier, Robert W., Radiographic studies of reef coral exoskeletons: Rates and patterns of coral growth, Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 14, 2, pp. 179-199, (1974); Dang, Phong X., Marine reservoir correction in the south of Vietnam estimated from an annually-banded coral, Radiocarbon, 46, 2, pp. 657-660, (2004); Druffel, Ellen R.M., Radiocarbon in annual coral rings from the eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, Geophysical Research Letters, 8, 1, pp. 59-62, (1981); Druffel, Ellen R.M., BOMB RADIOCARBON IN THE PACIFIC: ANNUAL AND SEASONAL TIMESCALE VARIATIONS., Journal of Marine Research, 45, 3, pp. 667-698, (1987); Druffel, Ellen R.M., Geochemistry of corals: Proxies of past ocean chemistry, ocean circulation, and climate, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 94, 16, pp. 8354-8361, (1997); Druffel, Ellen R.M., Regional variability of surface ocean radiocarbon from southern Great Barrier Reef corals, Radiocarbon, 37, 2, pp. 517-524, (1995); Farris, Amy, Wind-induced Kuroshio intrusion into the South China Sea, Journal of Oceanography, 52, 6, pp. 771-784, (1996); Prouty, Nancy G., Coral radiocarbon records of Indian Ocean water mass mixing and wind-induced upwelling along the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 109, 5, pp. C05003-C05003, (2004); Guilderson, Thomas P., Abrupt shift in subsurface temperatures in the tropical Pacific associated with changes in El Nino, Science, 281, 5374, pp. 240-243, (1998)","","University of Arizona","","","","","","00338222; 19455755","","RACAA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-53149134747"

Studies of flood propagation over the whole delta have been rare. In 2000, due to global climate change and La Niña phenomenon, the hydrological and meteorological situations were very complicated around the world in general, and in the Mekong River basin in particular. In Mekong Delta, flood occurred early and had two peaks in which the second peak was one of the highest in the past 80 years. This flood caused water levels in the upstream Mekong River basin to become about 1 to 3 m higher than the third warning level, and caused extremely severe inundation downstream. In Vietnam, this flood caused damage totaling about 5,000 billion VN dong (about 4 million US dollars at that time), and its level was used to consider the design elevation of flood control embankments. Thus, through study of this flood is necessary to mitigate flood damage and human suffering and to contribute to policy making and create the conditions for embankment elevation design. In this paper, analysis of the main characteristics of the flood of 2000 was carried out based on the observed data since 1926. Also, simulations were conducted using hydraulic models with topographical, hydrological and meteorological data. The flood simulations using hydraulic model for Vietnamese part of delta were carried out, especially for Dong Thap Muoi and Long Xuyen quadrant to analyze (1) how the flood was distributed spatially and temporally, (2) how long each inundation depth lasted, (3) the extent of the area of the flood, and (4) the effect of flood on paddy fields in 2000. The observed data and simulated results show that this flood was extremely large and complicated, causing severe inundation with the depth of 2.5 m lasting more than one month from mid-September to mid-October. Flood in August affected strongly the summer-autumn crop paddy field. The area inundated to the depth of 2.5 m was more than one thousand km2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flood; Hydraulic Model; Hydrology; Mekong River Delta; Simulation; Climate Change; Embankment; Flood Control; Flood Damage; Flooding; Hydrological Modeling; La Nina; Paddy Field; Quantitative Analysis; Simulation; Asia; Eurasia; Mekong Delta; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","climate change; embankment; flood control; flood damage; flooding; hydrological modeling; La Nina; paddy field; quantitative analysis; simulation; Asia; Eurasia; Mekong Delta; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","","","","Correia, Francisco Nunes, Flood hazard assessment and management: Interface with the public, Water Resources Management, 12, 3, pp. 209-227, (1998); Proceedings of Conference on Flood Modeling in Cuu Long River Delta, (1996); DeVantier, Bruce A., Review of GIS applications in hydrologic modeling, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management - ASCE, 119, 2, pp. 246-261, (1993); Proceedings of the Workshop on Hydrologic and Environmental Modeling in the Mekong Basin, (2000); Proceedings of the 13th IAHR Apd Congress Singapore 6 8 Aug 2002, (2002); Project of Flood Investigation and Assessment for 2001 in Cuu Long River Delta, (2002); Jain, Manoj Kumar, DEM-based modelling of surface runoff using diffusion wave equation, Journal of Hydrology, 302, 1-4, pp. 107-126, (2005); Japan Society for Natural Disaster Science, (2001); Proceedings of the 13th Congress the Apd IAHR, (2002); Gakujutsu Kenkyu School of Education Waseda University Series of Education, (2006)","","Association of Japanese Geographers","","","","","","","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-36248930419"

However, it has received little attention of the community due to the lack of a common annotated corpus for evaluation and comparison. Also, most previous studies focused on unsupervised-statistical approaches or combined too many techniques. Consequently, their accuracies are not as high as expected. This paper reports a careful investigation of using conditional random fields (CRFs) and support vector machines (SVMs) - two of the most successful statistical learning methods in NLP and pattern recognition - for solving the task. We first build a moderate annotated corpus using different sources of materials. For a careful evaluation, different CRF and SVM models using different feature settings were trained and their results are compared and contrasted with each other. In addition, we discuss several important points about the accuracy, computational cost, corpus size and other aspects that might influence the overall quality of Vietnamese word segmentation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conditional Random Fields; Maximum Matching; Segmenting And Labeling Sequence Data; Support Vector Machines; Word Segmentation; Asian Languages; Computational Costs; Conditional Random Field; Conditional Random Fields (crfs); Corpus Size; Language Processing; Maximum Matchings; Overall Quality; Sequence Data; Significant Impacts; Statistical Learning Methods; Svm Model; Word Segmentation; Field Vectors; Random Fields; Segmenting And Labeling Sequence Datum; Support Vectors Machine; Vietnamese; Computational Linguistics; Content Based Retrieval; Image Segmentation; Pattern Recognition; Random Processes; Support Vector Machines","Asian languages; Computational costs; Conditional random field; Conditional random fields (CRFs); Corpus size; Language processing; Maximum matchings; Overall quality; Sequence data; Significant impacts; Statistical learning methods; SVM model; Word segmentation; Field vectors; Random fields; Segmenting and labeling sequence datum; Support vectors machine; Vietnamese; Computational linguistics; Content based retrieval; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Random processes; Support vector machines","","","","Proceedings of the Corpus Linguistics 2003 Conference, (2003); 4th International Conference on Computer Sciences, (2006); Proceedings of the Sixth Natural Language Processing Pacific Rim Symposium, (2001); Icml, (2001); Liu, Dong C., On the limited memory BFGS method for large scale optimization, Mathematical Programming, 45, 1-3, pp. 503-528, (1989); Foundations of Linguistics and Vietnamese, (1997); 3th International Conference on Computer Sciences, (2005); Peng, Fuchun, Chinese segmentation and new word detection using conditional random fields, (2004); Rabiner, Lawrence R., A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE, 77, 2, pp. 257-286, (1989); Sha, Fei, Shallow parsing with conditional random fields, (2003)","","","","20th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, PACLIC 20","","Wuhan","90196","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863670592"

As part of improving surveillance in the region, the BioCaster project aims to develop a system based on text mining for automatically monitoring Internet news and other online sources in several regional languages. At the heart of the system is an application ontology which serves the dual purpose of enabling advanced searches on the mined facts and of allowing the system to make intelligent inferences for assessing the priority of events. However, it became clear early on in the project that existing classification schemes did not have the necessary language coverage or semantic specificity for our needs.

The present study indicates that the Green Revolution began in irrigated favorable areas and spread to the less favorable areas in Vietnam such as in other Asian countries. What is unique in Vietnam is that although the Green Revolution ended in the mid-1980s in the Philippines and Indonesia, it has still been sustained as of 2003. Our analyses revealed that such growth had been supported by continuous improvements of modern varieties by regional research institutes. The varieties imported from China have contributed to the Green Revolution in northern Vietnam and those developed by the International Rice Research Institute in southern Vietnam.

Vietnam, after acquiring Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) membership in 1995, has signed a bilateral trade package with the United States and participated in the China-ASEAN free trade area. This paper attempts to analyze the impact on Vietnam of ongoing regional economic integration, focusing on growth, poverty reduction and income distribution. For this purpose, we have constructed a globally linked Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and made use of Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database version 6.0 and Vietnam's living standards surveys. The simulation analysis shows that the regional economic integration generally has a positive impact. It both enhances welfare and improves income-distribution for Vietnam.

This paper describes the impact of agricultural practices on the original properties of slope land soils with special reference to changes in soil fertility and weathering in relation to soil erosion. Soil fertility was not extremely low in the higher commune, where the cooler climate would be more dominant factor controlling productivity. Therefore, the people made well-managed terraces to maintain their fields. On the other hand, in the lower commune, shifting cultivation is a dominant way of agriculture supported by the warmer climatic condition. Weathering status of soils was not greatly different among the three communes, but the current climatic conditions would affect the reactivity of soils. The clay dispersion ratio of all the sites studied was very low. In addition, the clay dispersion ratio and clay content were not different among different land uses. This means that soil erosion would not have a strong impact under current farming systems in the three communes. However, activity ratios of Al and Fe (Alo/Ald and Feo/Fed) became lower after cultivation, and therefore, in the long term, slight but continuous erosion might have occurred to reduce the activity of soils. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bac Ha; Contour Planting; Shifting Cultivation; Slope Land; Soil Erosion; Soil Fertility; Soil Weathering; Terracing; Vietnam; Agricultural Practice; Mountain Region; Soil Erosion; Soil Fertility; Asia; Eurasia; Lao Cai; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","agricultural practice; mountain region; soil erosion; soil fertility; Asia; Eurasia; Lao Cai; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam","","","","Report on Highland Education Science Health Development Organization Hedo, (2001); Itami, Katsuhiko, Dispersion behavior of soils from reclaimed lands with poor soil physical properties and their characteristics with special reference to clay mineralogy, Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 41, 1, pp. 45-54, (1995); Can J Soil Sci, (1966); Clays Clay Miner, (1960); Mitchell, James Kent, Soil loss estimation., pp. 17-62, (1980); Pedologist, (1990); Sakurai, Katsutoshi, Comparison of salt titration and potentiometric titration methods for the determination of zero point of charge (zpc), Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 34, 2, pp. 171-182, (1988); Sakurai, Katsutoshi, Factors affecting zero point of charge (zpc) of variable charge soils, Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 35, 1, pp. 21-31, (1989); Keys to Soil Taxonomy, (2003); Watanabe, Etsuko, Soil fertility and farming systems in a slash and burn cultivation area of Northern Laos, Japanese Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, 41, 4, pp. 519-537, (2004)","","","","","","","","05638682; 24241377","","","","Japanese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-2342531653"

Based on in-depth interviews in Hanoi with 20 respondents from various walks of life, it finds a high level of awareness of environmental problems and a considerable degree of concern about this issue. Most respondents report that they themselves, and their family members and friends, are concerned about environmental problems, but they believe government officials and leaders of big corporations and enterprises are not concerned. They say that they believe that humans are destroying nature because of the urgent need for resources on the part of the poor and the desire for wealth on the part of the rich and powerful. The views of respondents about ideal relations between humans and nature can be categorized in terms of two general cultural models. The first model views nature as a limited resource on which humans must rely for their survival. The second model views nature and human beings as having a balanced and interdependent relationship. The models are similar in that both express anthropocentric and utilitarian views. Most lay informants express variants of the first model, saying that human welfare depends on the natural environment. In particular, they stress, physical health concerns. Almost all of the elite interviewees employ variants if the second model, stating that people's activities have impacts on nature, and nature reactively affects the welfare of human beings. Consequently, they perceive a need to maintain ecological balance. Deforestation is recognized as a serious problem by all respondents but they display considerable differences in their assignment of blame for causing this problem and also in their proposed solutions to this problem. In comparing deforestation with other problems, most consider that deforestation is a more important problem than air pollution, climate change and global warming, and natural disasters, but less important than traffic accidents and the future of the Vietnamese economy. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

A speech corpus consisting of fifty-two six-syllable sequences with various combinations of tones was uttered by two speakers of Standard Vietnamese, one male and one female. The corpus was labeled on the syllabic level and analyzed using the Fujisaki model. Results show that the six tone types basically fall into two categories: Level, rising, curve and falling tone can be accurately modeled by using tone commands of positive or negative polarity. The so-called drop and broken tones, however, obviously require a special control causing creaky voice and in cases a very fast drop in F0 leading to temporary F0 halving or even quartering. In contrast to the drop tone, the broken tone exhibits an F0 rise and hence a positive tone command right after the creak occurs. Further observations suggest that drop and broken tone do not only differ from the other four tones with respect to their F0 characteristics, but also as to their much tenser articulation. A perception experiment performed with natural and resynthesized stimuli shows, inter alia, that tone 4 is most prone to confusion and that tone 6 obviously requires tense articulation as well as vocal fry to be identified reliably. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drops; Analysis And Synthesis; Fujisaki Model; Negative Polarity; Perception Experiment; Positive Tone; Speech Corpora; Tone Commands; Vietnamese; Speech Communication","Drops; Analysis and synthesis; Fujisaki model; Negative polarity; Perception experiment; Positive tone; Speech corpora; Tone commands; Vietnamese; Speech communication","","","","A Vietnamese Reference Grammar, (1987); Fujisaki, Hiroya, Analysis of voice fundamental frequency contours for declarative sentences of Japanese, Journal of the Acoustical Society of Japan (E) (English translation of Nippon Onkyo Gakkaishi), 5, 4, pp. 233-242, (1984); Reports of Autumn Meeting Acoust Soc Jpn, (1987); Mixdorff, Hansjörg, Perception of tone and vowel quantity in Thai, pp. 753-756, (2002); Mixdorff, Hansjörg, A novel approach to the fully automatic extraction of Fujisaki model parameters, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 3, pp. 1281-1284, (2000)","","International Speech Communication Association","et al.; Office of Naval Research International Field Office (ONRG); State of Geneva; State of Valais; Swiss National Science Foundation; UBS SA","8th European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology, EUROSPEECH 2003","","Geneva","124334","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951929131"

Its evolution in response to Holocene sea-level changes was clarified on the basis of sedimentary facies and 14 radiocarbon dates from the 40 m long Duy Tien core from the delta plain, and using previously reported geological, geomorphological, and archaeological data. The delta prograded into the drowned valley as a result of early Holocene inundation from 9 to 6 cal. kyr BP, as sea-level rise decelerated. The sea-level highstand at +2-3 m from 6 to 4 cal. kyr BP allowed widespread mangrove development on the delta plain and the formation of marine notches in the Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh areas. During sea-level lowering after 4 cal. kyr BP, the former delta plain emerged as a marine terrace, and the delta changed into the present tide- and wave-influenced delta with accompanying beach ridges. Delta morphology, depositional pattern, and sedimentary facies are closely related to Holocene sea-level changes. In particular, falling sea level at 4 cal. kyr BP had a major impact on the evolution of the Song Hong delta, and is considered to be linked to climate changes. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to examine the association of sociodemographic, reproductive, and other health behavioral factors with unintended pregnancy. A survey was conducted from May through November 1999 in Yamagata, Japan. We distributed anonymous self-administered questionnaires to cervical and breast cancer screening participants aged 35-49 years. There were 564 eligible women, and the number of respondents was 421 (74.6%). The proportion of women who had experienced unintended pregnancy was 46.2%, and 40.1% of them had repeated experiences. Among 312 pre-menopausal married women who did not want to become pregnant, 15.4% were not using any contraception. Factors that were significantly associated with the experience of unintended pregnancy were age of husband being 4 or more years older [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.83], and age at initiation of sexual intercourse (OR = 1.86) and marriage during teens (OR = 11.14). Analysis of 1255 pregnancies that the subjects had experienced showed that 51.2% and 25.9% of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies occurred as a result of no contraceptive use, and 39.5% and 71.1% of these ended in abortions. The number of past unintended pregnancies was significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with the number of pregnancies (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.49), live births (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.20) and abortions (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.63). This is the first epidemiological study in Japan to examine factors associated with unintended pregnancy, and also contraceptive use and pregnancy outcome for each of the unintended pregnancy women had experienced. Unintended pregnancy is not a rare event among our target population, and many unintended pregnancies leading to abortion could be prevented by effective contraceptive use. Results suggest that Yamagata's family planning strategies need to target both the younger and older generations, and address the role of men. A woman's pregnancy history reflecting her past experience of unintended pregnancy could be used as an indicator for recognizing the woman's need for appropriate contraceptive counseling for the prevention of repeated unintended pregnancies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The algorithm is applicable to relatively large numbers of particles with relatively high degrees of distribution density. This is mainly due to a new fitness function as well as unique genetic operations devised especially for the purpose of a particle pairing problem. The new fitness function is based on the relaxation of movement of a group of particles and is particularly suited for an increased density of particle images. The new genetic operations give rise to concentration of 'good' genes in a limited part of the gene strings and prevent them from being destroyed in the crossover and mutation processes. Another merit of the new algorithm is the genetic encoding scheme which can deal with all the possible concerns of the particle pairing problem, typical of which is the existence of unpaired particles. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flow Visualization; Functions; Genes; Genetic Algorithms; Image Analysis; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Particle Image Velocimetry (piv); Velocity Measurement","Flow visualization; Functions; Genes; Genetic algorithms; Image analysis; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Particle image velocimetry (PIV); Velocity measurement","","","","Proc 6th Asian Symp Visualization, (2001); Proc 2nd Pacific Symposium on Flow Visualization and Image Processing, (1999); J Visualization Soc Japan, (1997); Proc Vsj SPIE, (1998); Ohmi, Kazuo, Particle-tracking velocimetry with new algorithms, Measurement Science and Technology, 11, 6, pp. 603-616, (2000); Proc 9th Intern Symp Flow Visualization, (2000); Oyama, Ryuichiro Ichiro, Experimental study on space and time correspondences of traveling particles for 3-dimensional particle image velocimetry by genetic algorithms, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 3172, pp. 690-701, (1997); Proc Piv Fukui, (1997); Sheng, J., A genetic algorithm particle pairing technique for 3D velocity field extraction in holographic particle image velocimetry, Experiments in Fluids, 25, 5-6, pp. 461-473, (1998)","Kompenhans, J.","","","Particle Image Velocimetry","","Gottingen","62329","14348462","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1242329493"

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, United States","In this study, recent trends in the incidence of induced abortion are analyzed in order to identify the target population and its requirements for family planning policy in Japan. Abortion statistics from 1975 to 1995 from the Ministry of Health and Welfare are reviewed. The abortion rate (the number of cases of induced abortion per 1,000 women per year) for women younger than 20 increased during the study period. The abortion ratio (number of cases per 1,000 live births) remained the highest among women aged 40-44. An increase in the abortion ratio was seen in the two youngest groups (younger than 20 and 20-24), especially among those who were born after 1955. The proportion of abortions experienced by women younger than 25 increased from 18 percent between 1976 and 1980 to 30 percent between 1991 and 1995, and a slight increase was also observed among women aged 40-44. The proportion of abortions performed after eight weeks of a pregnancy for the two youngest groups remained higher than that for older age groups during 1975-95. The analysis demonstrates that women younger than 25 should be the principal concern of family planning policy in Japan. Further investigations on unintended pregnancy are recommended. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abortion; Family Planning; Fertility; Japan","abortion; family planning; fertility; Japan","","","","Hoken Eisei News, (1999); Into A New World Young Women S Sexual and Reproductive Lives, (1998); Sharing Responsibility Women Society and Abortion Worldwide, (1999); Coleman, S., The cultural context of condom use in Japan ( contraception)., Studies in Family Planning, 12, 1, pp. 28-39, (1981); Family Planning in Japanese Society, (1983); Goto, Aya, Oral contraceptives and women's health in Japan, JAMA, 282, 22, pp. 2173-2177, (1999); Research for the Prevention of Unwanted Birth, (1996); Hayashi, K., Analysis of the fertility decline in Japan--focusing on the period of 1950-60 and 1975-85, [Nippon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health, 39, 1, pp. 3-10, (1992); Vital Statistics, (2001); Fertility Change in Contemporary Japan, (1991)","","Blackwell Publishing Inc. subscrip@blackwellpub.com","","","","","","00393665; 17284465","","SFPLA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034485269"

This paper also aims to analyze the chu nom characters contained in it from the historical phonological point of view. This material was rediscovered and introduced by Le Thi Lien in her 1989 B. A. thesis. It is an inscription erected in 1343 on the Ho Thanh mountain (nui Non Nuoc) in the present Ninh Binh province, Vietnam. It concerns donations made by local inhabitants for the construction of a temple on the mountain. Before analyzing the chu nom characters in the inscription, we first review the traditional method of analyzing chu nom characters as proposed by Henri Maspero in 1912, for the purpose of demonstrating the limitations of his method in the analysis of our material. We then refer to recent Viet-Muong phonological studies based on the newly discovered and described groups of the Viet-Muong branch such as Arem, Chu't, Ma Li eng, Aheu, and Pong, most of which were not known when Maspero wrote his paper. One of the main phonological features that differentiate them from the Murong dialects described by Maspero is the existence of the disyllabic structure: (Co)vC<inf>1</inf>V(C<inf>2</inf>)/T. We also utilize newly discovered chu nom materials such as the Sino-Vietnamese text of Phat thuyet dai bao phu mau an trong kinh, compiled in the 15th century, which also throws light on our analysis. The material contains 11 common words and 18 person or place names written in chu nom characters. The latter 18 proper nouns are the object of discussion. Their common characteristics are the use of two characters for the transcription of one proper noun and occurrence of the vowel /a/ as the first element. We claim for these examples to show (1) certain patterns of the initial consonantal cluster, and (2) the trace of the disyllabic morphemes still preserved in the 14th century Vietnamese. Concerning the former point, we can reconstruct such patterns as /*bl-/, /*ml-/, and /*k'r-/ from our material. The latter point is of special importance. Nguyen Tai Can (1995) reconstructed the major members of the minor syllable ((C(O))v) in the disyllabic structure of Proto Viet-Muong The chu nom characters contained in the Sino-Vietnamese text of Phat thuye t d ai bao phu mau an trong kinh mentioned above, in turn, show all six of them, and the characters transcribing each of these minor syllables coincide with each other between these two materials, a fact that may reinforce the credibility of our analysis. In conclusion, the insertion of a non-distinctive schwa vowel between each of the initial consonantal clusters seems to have been common in Vietnamese during the 14th-15th centuries, but not in all cases. And the disyllabic structure of Vietnamese, or at least the trace of it, is recognized to have existed until as late as 15th century. © 2005 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.
