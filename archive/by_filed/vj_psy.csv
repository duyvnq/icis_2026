The parasite-stress model suggests that many patterns of human behavior and thought are adaptations to varying levels of exposure to parasites and pathogens. A growing body of health psychology research shows a link between positive future thinking and resiliency to various forms of disease. In this study, we investigate the link between historical pathogen prevalence in countries and individuals' perception of the future of humanity. We surveyed 18,981 participants across 68 nations, examining their beliefs about how well humanity will be doing 1000 years from now compared to the present. We found that individuals residing in regions with higher historical disease risk tend to have more positive views about the future of humanity than individuals residing in areas with lower historical disease risk. The difference could not be attributed to several other stress-inducing factors, such as climate stress, population density or objective or subjective socioeconomic indicators. This research contributes to a growing body of evidence demonstrating how disease risk shapes human cognition and encourages future exploration of the evolution of temporal forecasting and consciousness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collective Future Thinking; Evolution; Humanity; Parasite Stress; Pathogen Prevalence","","","","This work was supported by Norway Grants 2014-2021 operated by the National Science Centre (Poland) under Project Contract # 2019/34/H/HS6/00597 (GRIEG); Polish National Science Centre (# 2020/37/B/HS6/03142 ); Hungarian NKFIH- OTKA-K 135963 ; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development Grant 301298/2018-1 ; Ongoing Research Funding program ( ORF-2025-1204 ), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; HSE University Basic Research Program (Russia); and University of Roma Department of Educational Studies Grant DSF 2017-2018 .","Human Evolutionary Psychology, (2002); Bastian, Brock B., Explaining illness with evil: Pathogen prevalence fosters moral vitalism, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 286, 1914, (2019); Bates, Douglas M., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, 1, (2015); Busseri, Michael A., The Global Belief That “Life Gets Better and Better”: National Differences in Recollected Past, Present, and Anticipated Future Life Satisfaction Around the World, Across Time, and in Relation to Societal Functioning, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 123, 1, pp. 223-247, (2022); Chan, Meanne Ching Man, Global Trends in Cross-Cultural Endorsement of Social Mobility: Evidence From 167 Countries, American Psychologist, 76, 6, pp. 917-932, (2021); Diener, Edward F., The Satisfaction With Life Scale, Journal of Personality Assessment, 49, 1, pp. 71-75, (1985); A Mind so Rare the Evolution of Human Consciousness, (2001); Enders, Craig K., Centering Predictor Variables in Cross-Sectional Multilevel Models: A New Look at an Old Issue, Psychological Methods, 12, 2, pp. 121-138, (2007); Fincher, Corey L., Parasite-stress promotes in-group assortative sociality: The cases of strong family ties and heightened religiosity, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 35, 2, pp. 61-79, (2012); Gana, Kamel, Positive illusions and mental and physical health in later life, Aging and Mental Health, 8, 1, pp. 58-64, (2004)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01918869","","PEIDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012974884"

In addition, Facebook posts of the respective newspaper organisations were also analysed. This is a quantitative study and offers an extensive comparative overview of trends and patterns in media representation of the Games in different parts of the world. The results showed that the total number of articles and photographs varied greatly between countries and regions. Analysis of the Facebook posts showed a similar trend to newspapers. The subject of interest is predominantly still the male athletes, and particularly those competing in wheelchairs. In nearly all the publications sampled, media coverage featured more content of their local athletes than foreigners. Overall, there appears to be a great disparity in terms of coverage and content of the Paralympic Games between the 17 countries or regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research was supported by the Universiti Malaya Bantuan Kecil Penyelidikan BKP Grant (Grant no.

Adaptation to posed threats requires an understanding of hydrological responses to climate variability. Whilst these can be computationally modelled, observed streamflow data is essential for constraining models, and understanding and quantifying emerging trends in the water cycle. To date, the identification of such trends at the global scale has been hindered by data limitations – in particular, the prevalence of direct human influences on streamflow which can obscure climate-driven variability. By removing these influences, trends in streamflow data can be more confidently attributed to climate variability. Here we describe the Reference Observatory of Basins for INternational hydrological climate change detection (ROBIN) – the first iteration of a global network of streamflow data from national reference hydrological networks (RHNs) – comprised of catchments which are near-natural or have limited human influences. This collaboration has established a freely available global RHN dataset of over 3,000 catchments and code libraries, which can be used to underpin new science endeavours and advance change detection studies to support international climate policy and adaptation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Catchment Area (hydrology); Climate Change; Human; Prevalence; Water Cycle","article; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; human; prevalence; water cycle","","","The ROBIN (Reference Observatory of Basins for INternational hydrological climate change detection) project was funded the UK Natural Environment Research Council Global Partnership Seedcorn Fund - NE/W004038/1 and the NC-International programme -NE/X006247/1 delivering National Capability.

The dataset is standardized and, where available, includes information on taxonomy, habitat, body mass (for animals), geography, and environmental conditions such as temperature, solar radiation, and nutrient availability. By providing an unprecedented breadth of organismal stoichiometry, StoichLife enables the exploration of global patterns, ecological and evolutionary drivers, and context-dependent variations. This resource advances our understanding of the chemical makeup of life and its responses to environmental change, supporting progress in ecological stoichiometry and related fields. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Animal; Chemistry; Ecosystem; Plant; Animals; Carbon; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plants","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; animal; chemistry; ecosystem; plant; Animals; Carbon; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plants","","carbon, 7440-44-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus","This paper is a joint effort of the working group sBiomaps kindly supported by sDiv, the Synthesis Centre of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, funded by the German Research Foundation (FZT 118, 202548816).

Methods: This case-control study was conducted at five hospitals across Taiwan using purposive sampling. Physicians were matched by gender, seniority, and department; patients were matched by age, gender, cancer type, and stage. A total of 232 patients were included: 116 in the experimental group (physicians who received CST) and 116 in the control group (physicians without CST). Physicians' truth-telling practices were evaluated immediately after CST using a 70-item questionnaire. Patient emotional distress was assessed 3 months later using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Distress Thermometer. Results: A statistically significant difference in physicians' truth-telling practices was found between the groups. Physicians in the experimental group demonstrated significantly better truth-telling practices than those in the control group (265.23 ± 26.57 vs. 257.81 ± 29.84, p = 0.047). Three months after receiving bad news, patients in the experimental group had lower levels of depression (5.98 ± 3.80 vs. 7.26 ± 4.90, p = 0.049), anxiety (5.84 ± 3.47 vs. 6.80 ± 4.02, p = 0.030), and emotional distress (3.39 ± 2.60 vs. 4.40 ± 2.97, p = 0.013) compared to those in the control group. Conclusion: CST can improve physicians' truth-telling practices and reduce emotional distress in cancer patients. Regular CST should be integrated into medical education and in –service training to sustain these skills. Further studies are needed to explore the long-term benefits of CST and its impact on healthcare utilization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anxiety; Cancer Patients; Communication Skills Training; Depression; Emotional Distress; Truth-telling","","","","This study was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. MOST 102\u20102511\u2010S\u2010182\u2010004) matching funding from Chang Gung University (Grant No. NMRPD1C0211 and BMRP815).

A popular approach to unsupervised AD is clustering-based detection. However, this method lacks the ability to guarantee the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this paper, we propose SI-CLAD (Statistical Inference for CLustering-based Anomaly Detection), a novel statistical framework for testing the clustering-based AD results. The key strength of SI-CLAD lies in its ability to rigorously control the probability of falsely identifying anomalies, maintaining it below a prespecified significance level (Formula presented.)

By analysing the selection mechanism inherent in clustering-based AD and leveraging the selective inference (SI) framework, we prove that false detection control is attainable. Moreover, we introduce a strategy to boost the true detection rate, enhancing the overall performance of SI-CLAD.

We conducted two cross-cultural studies with 31,608 participants from 117 samples across 83 societies. Our findings reveal that, in more religious cultures, being in love is a weaker predictor of well-being compared to more secular cultures in four out of six models.

Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is one of the most popular robust regression methods for addressing this challenge. However, this method lacks the capability to guarantee the reliability of the anomaly detection (AD) results. In this paper, we propose CTRL-RANSAC (controllable RANSAC), a novel statistical method for testing the AD results obtained from RANSAC in linear regression tasks. The key strength of the proposed method lies in its ability to control the probability of misidentifying anomalies below a prespecified level (Formula presented.) (e.g., (Formula presented.)). By examining the selection strategy of RANSAC and leveraging the selective inference (SI) framework, we prove that achieving controllable RANSAC is indeed feasible. Furthermore, we introduce a more strategic and computationally efficient approach to enhance the true detection rate and overall performance of the CTRL-RANSAC. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets robustly support our theoretical results, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; P-value; Ransac; Statistical Hypothesis Testing; Uncertainty Quantification","","","","","Aggarwal, Charu C., Outlier analysis, 9781461463962, pp. 1-446, (2013); Andrews, David F., A robust method for multiple linear regression, Technometrics, 16, 4, pp. 523-531, (1974); Efficient Initial Pose Graph Generation for Global Sfm, (2021); Chen, Shuxiao, Valid Inference Corrected for Outlier Removal, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 29, 2, pp. 323-334, (2020); Le Duy, Vo Nguyen, Quantifying Statistical Significance of Neural Network-based Image Segmentation by Selective Inference, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, (2022); International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, (2024); International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, (2021); Le Duy, Vo Nguyen, More Powerful Conditional Selective Inference for Generalized Lasso by Parametric Programming, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23, (2022); Computing Valid P Value for Optimal Changepoint by Selective Inference Using Dynamic Programming, (2020); Ellenberg, Jonas H., The joint distribution of the standardized least squares residuals from a general linear regression, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 68, 344, pp. 941-943, (1973)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","20491573","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009762614"

We hypothesized that individuals in romantic relationships would report higher well-being (measured as happiness, harmony, and meaning in life) compared to singles. We anticipated that in cultures prioritizing relationships, the benefits of being coupled would be amplified, while in societies emphasizing autonomy, the well-being gap would diminish. Specifically, we posited that values prevalent in WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic)–such as self-direction and achievement–would positively moderate the association between relationship status and well-being, whereas values characteristic of non-WEIRD societies–such as tradition and conformity–would have a negative moderating effect. Our findings support that coupled individuals generally report higher well-being; however, the moderating effects of cultural values were more complex than expected. Cultural classifications of WEIRD and non-WEIRD did not consistently explain the well-being gap. Interestingly, in cultures emphasizing conformity, single and coupled individuals both reported greater meaning, leading to an overall decrease in the well-being gap. Conversely, higher self-direction values were associated with a wider well-being gap, with singles experiencing decreased happiness and meaning. These findings suggest that values such as conformity and self-direction exert domain-specific effects on well-being, influenced by broader social context and individual perceptions. Our research highlights the necessity of integrating cultural and individual factors in well-being research to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the quality of life for singles and those in relationships. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Relationship Status; Schwartz Values; Singles; Well-being; Adult; Article; Cultural Anthropology; Cultural Value; Female; Happiness; Human; Love; Major Clinical Study; Male; Quality Of Life; Social Environment; Wellbeing","adult; article; cultural anthropology; cultural value; female; happiness; human; love; major clinical study; male; quality of life; social environment; wellbeing","","","The present research was supported by multiple funding sources.

We propose and analyze some selection rules to solve this problem under the assumption that the final goal is to add evidence to make the pignistic transformation of the new body of evidence as representative as possible of the underlying distribution of evidence. Given the current absence of selection rules, we used the random choice of the next focal element as a benchmark, and then we formalized some possible selection rules, some of them based on the maximization or minimization of uncertainty. Then, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compare the proposed selection rules with the benchmark represented by the random selection. Numerical results show that the selection rule that balances the occurrence of elements of the frame of discernment within the set of focal elements outperforms the others, on average, as well as in a worst-case scenario, and consequently may reasonably serve as a guiding rule for the selection of new focal elements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dempster-shafer Theory; Evidence Theory; Focal Elements; Information Acquisition; 'current; Dempster Shafer Evidence Theory; Dempster-shafer Theory; Evidence Theories; Focal Element; Information Acquisitions; Minimisation; Random Choice; Selection Rules; Underlying Distribution; Monte Carlo Methods","'current; Dempster Shafer evidence theory; Dempster-Shafer theory; Evidence theories; Focal element; Information acquisitions; Minimisation; Random choice; Selection Rules; Underlying distribution; Monte Carlo methods","","","","Ayyub, Bilal M., Uncertainty modeling and analysis in engineering and the sciences, pp. 1-378, (2006); Emergence of Probability A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability Induction and Statistical Inference, (1975); Annals of Mathematical Statistics, (1967); A Mathematical Theory of Evidence, (1976); Possibility Theory an Approach to Computerized Processing of Uncertainty, (1988); Klir, George J., Generalized information theory: Aims, results, and open problems, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 85, 1-3, pp. 21-38, (2004); Zadeh, Lotfi A., Fuzzy sets as a basis for a theory of possibility, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 1, 1, pp. 3-28, (1978); Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic Theory and Applications, (1995); Ross, Timothy J., Fuzzy Logic with Engineering Applications: Third Edition, (2010); Petturiti, Davide, Conditional decisions under objective and subjective ambiguity in Dempster-Shafer theory, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 447, pp. 155-181, (2022)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001737433"

This study examined the structure of the self-report SDQ in a large multinational adolescent sample, tested its measurement invariance across genders and countries, and compared youth mental health in 12 European and Asian countries. Method: This study is part of the Eurasian Child Mental Health Study (EACMHS), a cross-cultural research study of child and adolescent well-being and mental health in 12 Asian and European countries. The sample (N = 26,306) came from a cross-sectional school-based survey of adolescents. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess a common measurement model for the self-report SDQ and the measurement invariance of the model across gender and country. Results: Fit indices in the total sample, in each gender, and in each of the 12 countries separately supported the use of the first-order 3-factor model (without the reverse-coded items) as a common measurement model for the self-report SDQ. Measurement invariance analyses provided good support for configural, metric, and scalar invariance across gender; however, metric invariance across countries was not supported. There were significant gender main effects for all SDQ subscales except for hyperactivity/inattention. Culture had significant main effects and moderated the magnitude of gender differences in all subscales. Conclusion: The present findings support the use of the correlated 3-factor model comprising the positive dimension of prosocial behavior and 2 broad groupings of internalizing and externalizing problems, without the reverse-coded problem items, as a common measurement model for the self-report SDQ internationally. Plain language summary: Using a sample of 26,306 adolescents from 12 European and Asian countries, this study examined how well the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a commonly used measure to assess child and adolescent mental health, can be used to compare child and adolescent mental health between different countries. In addition, the authors also measured adolescent mental health symptoms across the 12 countries. The study findings suggested that in all countries, girls scored higher than boys on prosocial behaviors and internalizing problems such as symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the extent to which genders differed on these features varied across cultures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent Mental Health; Cross-cultural Research; Factor Structure; Measurement Invariance; Strengths And Difficulties Questionnaire (sdq); Adolescent; Article; Asian; Confirmatory Factor Analysis; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Cultural Factor; Externalizing Disorder; Female; Human; Hyperactivity; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mental Health; Prosocial Behavior; Questionnaire; Self Report; Sex Difference; Validity; Asia; Child; Comparative Study; Diagnosis; Ethnology; Europe; Factor Analysis; Mental Disease; Psychometry; Adolescent; Child; Cross-cultural Comparison; Cross-sectional Studies; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Psychometrics; Self Report; Surveys And Questionnaires","adolescent; Article; Asian; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; externalizing disorder; female; human; hyperactivity; major clinical study; male; mental health; prosocial behavior; questionnaire; self report; sex difference; validity; Asia; child; comparative study; diagnosis; ethnology; Europe; factor analysis; mental disease; psychometry; Adolescent; Child; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Psychometrics; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","Funding text 1: Disclosure: Andre Sourander has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 101020767; total funding 2.5M\u20AC).

A combination of the emission model and financial model, along with secondary data, was adopted to simulate the environmental and economic impacts of three bus technologies (i.e. diesel buses, compressed natural gas buses, and electric buses). The environmental aspects were evaluated by setting the energy flow of CO<inf>2</inf> emission simulation, considering both direct and indirect emissions. The economic impacts of e-bus versus baseline diesel and CNG alternatives were estimated using the metric total cost of ownership (TCO) per km. We determined that although the mandatory e-bus program might represent a viable option when compared to the combustion alternatives from an environmental standpoint, e-buses are less appealing to bus companies due to their significantly lower cost-competitiveness under a traditional (current) business model. In contrast, a fleet leasing model brings large financial benefits to bus companies, increasing more probability of acceptability and intention of compliance from bus operators. Specifically, our analysis estimates that implementing the e-bus mandatory program with a new leasing model will result in a maximum of 47 %, 90, and 97 % emission removal in 2030, 2040, and 2050 respectively. In the same period, the TCO per km reduces a maximum of 41.8 %, 31.0 %, and 17.4 %, respectively, compared to the traditional business model. The findings can be valuable for cities, practitioners, and bus companies, aiding in a better understanding of the challenges and benefits of the bus leasing model in order to better plan for e-bus uptake in Vietnam. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Case Study; Electric Buses; Ghg Emissions; Total Cost Of Ownership","","","","This study is based on research supported by a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23K04063 ) and the VinUni (VUNI.CEI.FS_0001 Digital Twin Platform to Empower Communities towards an Eco-friendly and Heathy Future)","Amasawa, Eri, Environmental potential of reusing, renting, and sharing consumer products: Systematic analysis approach, Journal of Cleaner Production, 242, (2020); Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, (1997); undefined, (2019); Electric Vehicle Outlook, (2025); Electric Vehicle Outlook 2021, (2021); Bohnsack, RenÃ©, Business models for sustainable technologies: Exploring business model evolution in the case of electric vehicles, Research Policy, 43, 2, pp. 284-300, (2014); International Journal of Environmental Chemical Ecological Geological and Geophysical Engineering, (2016); Christensen, Thomas Budde, Can innovative business models overcome resistance to electric vehicles?

Objective: The objective of this study is to examine associations between (1) screen time (h/day) and total daily SB (h/day), and gross and fine motor skills, and (2) meeting the restraint, screen time and overall SB (restraint and screen time) guidelines and fine and gross motor skills. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 1394 3- to 4-year-olds from the pilot phase of the SUNRISE International study. Time spent in SB was measured using the activPAL accelerometer, whereas screen time and restraint were measured using a parent questionnaire. Fine and gross motor skills were measured using parent-reported Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Associations between SB and motor skills were determined using linear and logistic regression, adjusting for sex and socioeconomic status. Results: Every additional 1 h of screen time was associated with 0.50-point reduction in gross motor skills scores (p = 0.008). More screen time was associated with decreased odds of being on track for fine and gross motor skill development (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). Meeting the screen time (p = 0.009) and overall SB guidelines (p = 0.006) were favourably associated with fine motor skills scores. Meeting the screen time, restraint and overall SB guidelines were favourably associated with gross motor skills scores (p = 0.007, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), higher odds of being on track for fine (p = 0.033, p = 0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively) and gross motor skills (p = 0.006, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) development. Conclusion: The present study adds to the evidence on the importance of sedentary behaviour for the motor development of 3- to 4-year-olds. It is important that policy makers and health educators develop strategies that will encourage and promote adherence to sedentary behaviour guidelines among 3- and 4-year-olds. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Motor Competence; Motor Skills; Preschoolers; Restrained Sitting; Screen Time; Accelerometry; Child Development; Cross-sectional Study; Female; Human; Male; Motor Performance; Physiology; Pilot Study; Preschool Child; Questionnaire; Screen Time; Secondary Data Analysis; Sedentary Lifestyle; Accelerometry; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Pilot Projects; Screen Time; Secondary Data Analysis; Sedentary Behavior; Surveys And Questionnaires","accelerometry; child development; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; motor performance; physiology; pilot study; preschool child; questionnaire; screen time; secondary data analysis; sedentary lifestyle; Accelerometry; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Pilot Projects; Screen Time; Secondary Data Analysis; Sedentary Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This study was supported by the Ghana Scholarship Secretariat, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (APP1176858); the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Planning and Dissemination (392396); the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (GUP-2018-142); the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (309301/2020-3); the Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine's Fund for Science (1320/H\u0110-T\u0110HYKPNT); the Sasakawa Sports Foundation (190A2-004); Region \u00D6sterg\u00D6tland; the Biomedical Research Foundation; the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand; Comprehensive Health and Epidemiological Surveillance System (CHESS); the American Council on Exercise; and the Dr Stella de Silva Research Grant at the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians.

We contribute to the growing literature by examining the relationship between IPV and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in Vietnamese children. Employing an instrumental variable approach to address potential endogeneity concerns, we analyzed data from the National Survey on Domestic Violence Against Women. Two-stage least squares regressions show that a one standard deviation increase in the IPV index led to a 0.378-point increase in the child behavioral problem score. The effect was mainly driven by children living in rural areas and less wealthy households. We further suggest that witnessing IPV and the negative impacts of IPV on women's health may be pathways through which IPV affects children's development. These findings highlight IPV as a major risk factor for negative child development outcomes, thus informing public health initiatives and social service interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child Development; Domestic Violence; Health; Instrumental Variable; Intimate Partner Violence; Vietnam","","","","We thank the Vietnamese General Statistics Office for letting us to access the data.","Achenbach, Thomas M., The classification of child psychopathology: A review and analysis of empirical efforts, Psychological Bulletin, 85, 6, pp. 1275-1301, (1978); Aizer, Anna, Poverty, violence, and health: The impact of domestic violence during pregnancy on newborn health, Journal of Human Resources, 46, 3, pp. 518-538, (2011); Alatupa, Saija, Disruptive behavior in childhood and socioeconomic position in adulthood: A prospective study over 27 years, International Journal of Public Health, 58, 2, pp. 247-256, (2013); Almond, Douglas, Childhood circumstances and adult outcomes: Act II, Journal of Economic Literature, 56, pp. 1360-1446, (2018); Anderson, Stephen A., The impact of couple violence on parenting and children: An overview and clinical implications, American Journal of Family Therapy, 27, 1, pp. 1-19, (1999); Bair-Merritt, Megan H., Physical health outcomes of childhood exposure to intimate partner violence: A systematic review, Pediatrics, 117, 2, pp. e278-e290, (2006); Bhattacharya, Haimanti, Spousal Violence and Women's Employment in India, Feminist Economics, 21, 2, pp. 30-52, (2015); Bhuller, Manudeep, Domestic Violence Reports and the Mental Health and Well-Being of Victims and Their Children, Journal of Human Resources, 59, Supplement, pp. S152-S186, (2024); Bindler, Anna, Scaring or Scarring?

Four types of prototype flux-cored wires with different sodium contents in the flux were fabricated. By using these wires, the influence mechanism of sodium on the metal transfer behavior was elucidated through shadowgraph measurements of the metal transfer behavior as well as spectroscopic and color image observations of the arc characteristics. It was found that the metal transfer between 190 A and 310 A was in the projected transfer mode and could be further classified into two sub-modes (type A and type B) based on the droplet formation process. A larger droplet was formed on the side of flux column in type A, while a smaller one was formed in the center covering the flux in type B. The metal transfer frequency became larger in the latter case for the same wire feeding speed. Type A tended to dominate in the lower current and lower sodium content conditions, while type B dominated in the opposite conditions. The dominant sub-mode was determined to depend on the Lorentz force acting on the droplet. At medium currents (250 A and 280 A), both sub-modes appeared in similar proportions. The maximum metal transfer frequency occurred at a particular sodium content. When the sodium content was smaller or larger, type A or type B became dominant, respectively. The sodium content at which the maximum frequency occurred decreased when the current increased. In type A, the iron plasma was widely distributed on the droplet side of the flux, while the sodium plasma was concentrated near the flux on the opposite side, so both were separated. In contrast, in type B, the sodium plasma was concentrated around the flux at the center and the iron plasma was widely distributed in the arc column, so both overlapped around the center. Sodium has a low boiling point and low ionization potential. In type A, the sodium vapor greatly increased the electrical conductivity of plasma around the flux column, so part of the current flowed from the wire through the sodium plasma to the weld pool. Accordingly, the current flowing through the bottom of the droplet to the arc decreased, leading to a lower arc pressure and recoil pressure under the droplet, and causing the metal transfer frequency to increase with sodium content. On the other hand, in type B, the sodium vaporization increased around the center, increasing the recoil pressure. In addition, the current density at the bottom of the droplet increased due to the current concentration in the arc, causing the arc pressure to rise. Therefore, the metal transfer frequency tended to decrease with sodium content. Due to the balance of these factors, the metal transfer frequency has a maximum at a particular sodium content. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfer; Sodium Vapor; Alkali Metals; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide Arc Welding; Concentration (process); Drop Wires; Inert Gas Welding; Inert Gases; Ionization Potential; Iron; Metal Insulator Transition; Phosphorus; Sodium Metallography; Submerged Arc Welding; X Ray Absorption Spectroscopy; 'current; Alkali-elements; Arc Pressure; Arc-welding; Condition; Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfer Frequency; Metal Transfers; Recoil Pressure; Sodium Vapors; Flux-cored Arc Welding (fcaw)","Alkali metals; Carbon; Carbon dioxide arc welding; Concentration (process); Drop wires; Inert gas welding; Inert gases; Ionization potential; Iron; Metal insulator transition; Phosphorus; Sodium metallography; Submerged arc welding; X ray absorption spectroscopy; 'current; Alkali-elements; Arc pressure; Arc-welding; Condition; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfer frequency; Metal transfers; Recoil pressure; Sodium vapors; Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW)","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University .","undefined, (2004); undefined, (2022); Świerczyńska, Aleksandra, Exploring the trends in flux-cored arc welding: scientometric analysis approach, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 130, 1-2, pp. 87-110, (2024); Yu, Jiyoung, Metal-cored welding wire for minimizing weld porosity of zinc-coated steel, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 249, pp. 350-357, (2017); French, Ian E., Comparison of pulsed and conventional welding with basic flux cored and metal cored welding wires, Welding Journal, 74, 6, (1995); Bauné, E., Assessing metal transfer stability and spatter severity in flux cored arc welding, Science and Technology of Welding and Joining, 6, 3, pp. 139-148, (2001); Lu, Fenggui, Analysis of energy flow in gas metal arc welding processes through self-consistent three-dimensional process simulation, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 68, pp. 215-223, (2014); Soderstrom, E.

However, power and received status are not synonymous-individuals in positions of power may or may not be accorded the respect corresponding to their role. Using a cooperatively collected dataset from 18,096 participants across 70 cultures, we investigate, through a survey-based correlational design, when perceived position-based power (operationalized as influence and control) of various powerholders is associated with their elevated social status (operationalized as perceived respect and instrumental social value). We document that the positive link between power and status characterizes most cultural regions, except for WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) and Post-Soviet regions. The strength of this association depends on individual and cultural factors. First, the perceived other-orientation of powerholders amplifies the positive link between perceived power and status. The perceived self-orientation of powerholders weakens this relationship. Second, among cultures characterized by low Self-Expression versus Harmony (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan), high Embeddedness (e.g., Senegal), and high Cultural Tightness (e.g., Malaysia), the association between power and status tends to be particularly strong. The results underline the importance of both individual perceptions and societal values in how position-based power relates to social status.

Methods: Participants were 3507 preschoolers from 37 countries. Nighttime sleep characteristics and nap duration (accelerometer: n = 1950) and family practices (parental questionnaire) were measured. Mixed models were used to estimate the marginal means of sleep characteristics by region and examine the differences. Results: Geocultural region explained up to 30% of variance in sleep characteristics. A pattern of short nighttime sleep duration, low sleep efficiency, and long nap duration was observed in Eastern Europe, Northeast Asia, and Southeast Asia. The second pattern, with later sleep midpoints and greater night-to-night sleep variability, was observed in South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America. Compared to the Minority World, less optimal sleep characteristics were observed in several Majority World regions, with medium-to-large effect sizes (|d|=0.48-2.35). Several Majority World regions reported more frequent parental smartphone use during bedtime routines (Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia: 0.77-0.99 units) and were more likely to have electronic devices in children's bedroom (Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Asia: OR = 5.97-16.57) and co-sleeping arrangement (Asia, Latin America: OR = 7.05-49.86), compared to the Minority World. Conclusions: Preschoolers' sleep profiles and related family practices vary across geocultural regions, which should be considered in sleep health promotion initiatives and policies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Sleep; Cross-cultural Comparison; Early Childhood; Public Health; Africa South Of The Sahara; Article; Asia; Child; Controlled Study; Cultural Factor; Eastern Europe; Female; General Practice; Human; Human Experiment; Male; Middle East; Night Sleep; North Africa; Pacific Islands; Pilot Study; Preschool Child; Questionnaire; Sleep; Sleep Time; South And Central America; South Asia; Southeast Asia","Africa south of the Sahara; Article; Asia; child; controlled study; cultural factor; Eastern Europe; female; general practice; human; human experiment; male; Middle East; night sleep; North Africa; Pacific islands; pilot study; preschool child; questionnaire; sleep; sleep time; South and Central America; South Asia; Southeast Asia","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the families that participated in the SUNRISE pilot study, the early childhood education and care services that facilitated participant recruitment, the data collectors, and the SUNRISE Coordinating Centre staff at the University of Wollongong.

Methods: An initial 16-item questionnaire, developed within an addiction framework, was administered alongside job stress, job satisfaction, and self-esteem measures in a total sample of 31,352 employees from six continents and 85 cultures (63.5% females, mean age of 39.24 years). Results: Based on theoretical premises and psychometric testing, the International Work Addiction Scale (IWAS) was developed as a short measure representing essential features of work addiction. The seven-item version (IWAS-7), covering all seven components of work addiction, showed partial scalar invariance across 81 cultures, while the five-item version (IWAS-5) showed it across all 85 cultures. Higher levels of work addiction on both versions were associated with higher job stress, lower job satisfaction, and lower self-esteem across cultures. The optimal cut-offs for the IWAS-7 (24 points) and IWAS-5 (18 points) were established with an overall accuracy of 96% for both versions. Discussion and conclusions: The IWAS is a valid, reliable, and short screening scale that can be used in different cultures and languages, providing comparative and generalizable results. The scale can be used globally in clinical and organizational settings, with the IWAS-5 being recommended for most practical and clinical situations. This is the first study to provide data supporting the hypothesis that work addiction is a universal phenomenon worldwide. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bergen Work Addiction Scale; Compulsive Overworking; Cross-cultural; Validation Study; Work Addiction; Workaholism; Adult; Article; Behavior Disorder Assessment; Employee; Female; Human; International Work Addiction Scale; Job Satisfaction; Job Stress; Male; Psychometry; Questionnaire; Self Esteem; Validation Study; Workaholism; Addiction; Cultural Factor; Devices; Diagnosis; Middle Aged; Psychological Rating Scale; Reproducibility; Self Concept; Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Cross-cultural Comparison; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Stress; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Reproducibility Of Results; Self Concept; Surveys And Questionnaires","adult; Article; behavior disorder assessment; employee; female; human; International Work Addiction Scale; job satisfaction; job stress; male; psychometry; questionnaire; self esteem; validation study; workaholism; addiction; cultural factor; devices; diagnosis; middle aged; psychological rating scale; reproducibility; self concept; Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Stress; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Self Concept; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","This work was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland [grant number 2020/39/D/HS6/ 00198].

Since 2012, the GG initiatives have focused on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and enhancing energy efficiency by promoting a shift from private to public transport. The transport equity impacts of these initiatives are studied and quantified using comprehensive data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) between 2014 and 2020. To explore horizontal and vertical equity, we developed a transit service index to measure changes in the implementation of GG initiatives and employed the Entropy weighting analysis (EWA) method, cluster analyses alongside the Lorenz curves, and the Gini index. The spatial distribution of transport equity changes is mapped to illustrate regional variations in response to GG initiatives. Results are presented through Lorenz curves, showcasing improvements in horizontal transport equity across Vietnam's regions, while vertical equity among provinces is assessed using the Gini index. The study contributes in practice by providing evidence to policymakers for a better understanding of the GG initiatives’ impacts. Finally, the study proposes several implications for policymakers to create efficient GG measures to retain transport equity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entropy Weighting Analysis; Green Growth; Transit Service Index; Transport Equity","","","","This work was supported by the VinUni (Digital Twin Platform for Green and Sustainable Management of Transportation [Digital Twin for Green Transportation] VUNI.GT .NTKH.09) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23\u202FK04063).","Abid, Nabila, Green growth and sustainable development: dynamic linkage between technological innovation, ISO 14001, and environmental challenges, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 17, pp. 25428-25447, (2022); Bandegani, Milad, Evaluation of horizontal equity under a distance-based transit fare structure, Journal of Public Transportation, 19, 3, pp. 161-172, (2016); Bø, Eirill, Use of GPS-data to improve transport solutions in a cost and environmental perspective, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives, 13, (2022); Browne, David, Comparative analysis of evaluation techniques for transport policies, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 31, 3, pp. 226-233, (2011); Cao, Yaru, Impact of environmental regulation on green growth in China’s manufacturing industry–based on the Malmquist-Luenberger index and the system GMM model, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 33, pp. 41928-41945, (2020); Carleton, Phillip R., A comparative analysis of the challenges in measuring transit equity: definitions, interpretations, and limitations, Journal of Transport Geography, 72, pp. 64-75, (2018); Chen, Zhenhua, Impact of high-speed rail on regional economic disparity in China, Journal of Transport Geography, 65, pp. 80-91, (2017); Delbosc, Alexa Reynolds, Using Lorenz curves to assess public transport equity, Journal of Transport Geography, 19, 6, pp. 1252-1259, (2011); undefined, (2005); undefined, (1912)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","25901982","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217227068"

We use Zimbabwe’s 1980 expansion of secondary education as a natural experiment to explore its effects on various aspects of women’s empowerment, such as reproductive self-determination, household decision-making power, and attitudes towards and experiences of domestic violence. Results indicate that women affected by the reform received an average of 2.73 additional years of education compared to their peers. The impact is particularly significant for women in rural areas and those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. One additional year of education resulted in a 0.43-year delay in first cohabitation, a 0.26-year delay in first birth, a 5 percentage point increase in household purchase decision-making, and a 1.2 percentage point increase in decision-making power regarding contraceptive use. Furthermore, there was a 4.1 percentage point decrease in agreement on beating by a partner is justified for any reason, a 3.7 percentage point reduction in agreement on beating is justified if a woman refuses to have sex with her partner, and a 0.6-percentage point decrease in the probability of experiencing unwanted sexual intercourse. The study remains robust through various checks. The mechanism is elucidated, demonstrating that secondary education reform significantly promoted women’s empowerment through improved access to information, assortative matching, and labor market involvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal Analysis; Demographic Health Survey; Secondary Education; Women’s Empowerment; Zimbabwe; Domestic Violence; Education Reform; Empowerment; Health Survey; Secondary Education; Womens Status; Zimbabwe","domestic violence; education reform; empowerment; health survey; secondary education; womens status; Zimbabwe","","","We acknowledge the financial support that we received from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up (Grant No. 23K18795).","Acosta, Mariola, What does it Mean to Make a ‘Joint’ Decision?

Using a cross-sectional dataset of 330 manufacturing plants from the 4th round of the High-Performance Manufacturing Project, we tested the proposed relationships through moderation analysis. The results indicate that psychological safety has a strong positive impact on improvement capability, particularly in the improvement dimension. Unexpectedly, the findings do not support the moderating effect of manufacturing complexity on the relationship between psychological safety and improvement capability. However, a post hoc analysis reveals that product complexity negatively moderates the relationship between psychological safety and the improvement dimension, suggesting that the effect of psychological safety on the improvement dimension is less salient under conditions of high product complexity. Our findings contribute to continuous improvement and psychological safety literature in two ways: (1) by integrating continuous improvement literature and positive organizational scholarship to empirically examine the facilitating role of psychological safety on improvement capability, and (2) by empirically investigating the efficacious of psychological safety in facilitating improvement capability across different levels of manufacturing complexity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High-performance Manufacturing; Improvement Capability; Manufacturing Complexity; Process Complexity; Product Complexity; Psychological Safety","","","","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) numbers JP19H01520 and JP22H00874.","Agostini, Lara, Organizational and managerial challenges in the path toward Industry 4.0, European Journal of Innovation Management, 22, 3, pp. 406-421, (2019); Ahmad, Sohel, The impact of human resource management practices on operational performance: Recognizing country and industry differences, Journal of Operations Management, 21, 1, pp. 19-43, (2003); Ahmed, Pervaiz Khalid, Culture and climate for innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 1, 1, pp. 30-43, (1998); Ahmed, Pervaiz Khalid, Cultures for continuous improvement and learning, Total Quality Management, 10, 4-5, pp. 426-434, (1999); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Almaatouq, Abdullah, Task complexity moderates group synergy, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 36, (2021); Anand, Gopesh, Dynamic capabilities through continuous improvement infrastructure, Journal of Operations Management, 27, 6, pp. 444-461, (2009); Ateş, Melek Akın, Order from chaos: A meta-analysis of supply chain complexity and firm performance, Journal of Supply Chain Management, 58, 1, pp. 3-30, (2022); Bello Pintado, Alejandro, Process control and quality performance: the role of shop-floor leadership practices, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 31, 7-8, pp. 829-846, (2020); Beraldin, Andrea Roberto, Employee involvement for continuous improvement and production repetitiveness: a contingency perspective for achieving organisational outcomes, Production Planning and Control, 33, 4, pp. 323-339, (2022)","","Springer","","","","","","19369743; 19369735","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214442841"

This article suggests an update to the exploration strategy to enhance its efficacy in engineering design problems and maintain the simplicity of the algorithm. Performance evaluations were conducted on challenging composite functions and engineering design problems. In addition, the metaheuristic structural binary-distribution technique is introduced, integrating the YUKI algorithm with gradient descent for topology optimization. This technique is tested on the problem of maximizing structural stiffness, based on strain energy, across low and high dimensions, and in the problem of heat dissipation.

Based on data collected from Vietnamese firms, the study employs regression analysis and PROCESS macro with a bootstrap method. Analytical results illustrate that quality management shows a significant effect on economic, environmental, and social bottom lines with or without the mediating role of supply chain management. The direct impact of supply chain management on those performances is insignificant, but it becomes significant with the mediating effect of quality management. Quality management seems to be a prerequisite for an effective supply chain quality model regarding sustainability. Moreover, the concurrence of supply chain and quality management results in a conflictual effect on economic return, although some possible synergy could be found among individual practices. It sheds light on the efficient resource allocation to achieve a certain level of balance in achieving sustainable goals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Country; Scqm; Supply Chain Quality Management; Tbl; Triple Bottom Line","","","","This research is partially funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Abbas, Jawad, Impact of total quality management on corporate sustainability through the mediating effect of knowledge management, Journal of Cleaner Production, 244, (2020); Ageron, Blandine, Sustainable supply management: An empirical study, International Journal of Production Economics, 140, 1, pp. 168-182, (2012); Alsawafi, Ahmed, The impacts of internal quality management relations on the triple bottom line: A dynamic capability perspective, International Journal of Production Economics, 232, (2021); Ali AlShehail, Ohoud, Total quality management and sustainability in the public service sector: the mediating effect of service innovation, Benchmarking, 29, 2, pp. 382-410, (2022); Apornak, Arash, Extension of the model of manufacturing supply chain quality management: An empirical study, International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management, 28, 4, pp. 417-437, (2019); History of Total Quality Management TQM, (2013); Bhatia, Manjot Singh, Green supply chain management: Scientometric review and analysis of empirical research, Journal of Cleaner Production, 284, (2021); Birkel, Hendrik, Potentials of industry 4.0 for supply chain management within the triple bottom line of sustainability – A systematic literature review, Journal of Cleaner Production, 289, (2021); Carter, Craig R., A framework of sustainable supply chain management: Moving toward new theory, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 38, 5, pp. 360-387, (2008); Baumann-Chardine, Émilie, A framework for sustainable performance assessment of supply chain management practices, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 76, 1, pp. 138-147, (2014)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","1741816X; 14606739","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004222911"

Higher ACN and CCN predicted greater endorsement of COVID-19 unfounded beliefs and higher likelihood of having recently engaged in pandemic-related prevention, hoarding, and prosociality. The predictive effects of ACN and CCN were independent, suggesting construct separability. Fear positively predicted endorsement of unfounded beliefs and behaviors, but the slope of that relation was flattened when ACN and CCN were particularly high. Finally, the relation between ACN or CCN and outcomes changed across countries varying in collective fear. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collective Narcissism; Covid-19; Hoarding Behavior; Prevention; Prosociality; Unfounded Beliefs","","","","Funding text 1: The work of Magdalena \u017Bemojtel-Piotrowska and Jaros\u0142aw Piotrowski was supported by grant 2017/26/E/HS6/00282 from the National Science Centre, Poland.

Accurately analyzing the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is therefore necessary for sustainable forest management and climate change mitigation. Previous studies explored the potential of random forest (RF) in modeling forest SOCD using various environmental data sources. However, how forest SOCD prediction would be affected by using random forest regression kriging (RFRK), which integrates the predictive power of RF in generating deterministic trends and the capability of the ordinary kriging (OK) in handling spatial autocorrelation structure of residuals, based on the environmental data sources and their combinations remains elusive and deserves further exploration. For this purpose, 104 soil samples were collected at a depth of 30 cm in forest ecosystems of Central Vietnam, and 33 environmental covariates were derived from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (AL2) imagery, digital elevation model (DEM), and climatic data. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to evaluate and compare the model performances, four metrics, including coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative improvement (RI), were calculated. The results showed that enhanced RFRK performance for forest SOCD estimation was found with the inclusion of additional environmental data sources, with RFRK based on all data sources achieving a high accuracy (R2 = 0.78, MAE = 8.28 t·ha−1, and RMSE = 10.54 t·ha−1). The comparison of the RF and RFRK models exhibited that additionally interpolated residuals by OK were more accurate than only considering the influences of predictor covariates. The relative improvement of the RFRK models over the RF models in forest SOCD estimation was notable, with RIR<inf>2</inf> ranging from 8.20 to 65.00%, RI<inf>MAE</inf> ranging from 8.18 to 21.07%, and RI<inf>RMSE</inf> ranging from 6.76 to 18.18%. The result from our case study emphasizes the robustness of RFRK using S2, AL2, DEM, and climatic data in accurately predicting forest SOCD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Soil Mapping; Forest Ecosystems; Multi-source Environmental Data; Random Forest Regression Kriging; Soil Organic Carbon Density; Data; Digital Mapping; Forest Ecosystem; Kriging; Modeling; Organic Carbon; Regression Analysis; Soil Organic Matter; Spatial Distribution; Viet Nam","data; digital mapping; forest ecosystem; kriging; modeling; organic carbon; regression analysis; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; Viet Nam","","","Open Access funding provided by Okayama University.","Abbaszad, Parya, Evaluation of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 vegetation indices to predict soil organic carbon using machine learning models, Modeling Earth Systems and Environment, 10, 2, pp. 2581-2592, (2024); AlaviPanah, Seyed Kazem, The Shadow Effect on Surface Biophysical Variables Derived from Remote Sensing: A Review, Land, 11, 11, (2022); Ameray, Abderrahmane, Forest Carbon Management: a Review of Silvicultural Practices and Management Strategies Across Boreal, Temperate and Tropical Forests, Current Forestry Reports, 7, 4, pp. 245-266, (2021); García-Asuero, Agustín García, The correlation coefficient: An overview, Critical Reviews in Analytical Chemistry, 36, 1, pp. 41-59, (2006); Ayele, Gebiaw T., Terrain effects on the spatial variability of soil physical and chemical properties, Soil Systems, 4, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Balzter, Heiko, Forest mapping and monitoring with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Progress in Physical Geography, 25, 2, pp. 159-177, (2001); Benesty, Jacob, On the importance of the pearson correlation coefficient in noise reduction, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 16, 4, pp. 757-765, (2008); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Brownstein, Gretchen E., Chance in plant communities: A new approach to its measurement using the nugget from spatial autocorrelation, Journal of Ecology, 100, 4, pp. 987-996, (2012); Brus, D.

There is a lack of cross-cultural studies examining adolescent help-seeking behavior from both formal and informal sources, including both high-and lower-income countries. This study investigates mental health help-seeking behavior in eight Asian and European countries. Data from 13,184 adolescents aged 13–15 (51% girls) was analysed using mixed-effects logistic regression with school-wise random intercepts to compare countries and genders. Although a significant proportion of adolescents considered getting or sought informal help, formal help-seeking remained exceptionally low, especially in middle-income countries (< 1%), while it ranged from 2 to 7% in high-income countries. Among adolescents with high emotional and behavioral problems (scoring above the 90th percentile on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), 1–2% of those in middle-income countries and 6–25% of those in high-income countries sought formal help. Girls generally seek more help than boys. The study shows the most adolescents do not receive formal help for mental health problems. The unmet need gap is enormous, especially in lower-income countries. Informal sources of support, including relatives, peers, and teachers, play a crucial role, especially in lower-income countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Cross-cultural; Help-seeking; Mental Health; Unmet Need; Adolescent; Article; Asia; Child Psychiatry; China; Emotional Disorder; Europe; Female; Finland; Greece; Help Seeking Behavior; High Income Country; Human; India; Israel; Japan; Logistic Regression Analysis; Low Income Country; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mental Disease; Mental Health Care; Mental Health Service; Middle Income Country; Norway; Problem Behavior; Social Status; Unmet Medical Need; Cultural Factor; Epidemiology; Health Service; Patient Attitude; Therapy; Adolescent; Cross-cultural Comparison; Female; Health Services Needs And Demand; Help-seeking Behavior; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Patient Acceptance Of Health Care","adolescent; Article; Asia; child psychiatry; China; emotional disorder; Europe; female; Finland; Greece; help seeking behavior; high income country; human; India; Israel; Japan; logistic regression analysis; low income country; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health care; mental health service; middle income country; Norway; problem behavior; social status; unmet medical need; cultural factor; epidemiology; health service; patient attitude; therapy; Adolescent; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Help-Seeking Behavior; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Patient Acceptance of Health Care","","","This study was funded by the Academy of Finland (decision numbers 320162 and 308552), Finnish Pediatric Research Foundation (AS), the Scandinavia-Japan Sasakawa Foundation (YM), and the University of Turku Graduate School (YM).

Most recent text generation models have mainly utilized the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and achieved promising results. However, while working on this problem, we observed that important indicators like salient words and sentences from downstream generation tasks can still be useful and beneficial for enhancing the performance. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring and investigating the contribution of auxiliary supervised learning tasks to improve the performance of PLMs for text generation. To this end, we observe the nature of text generation under three scenarios: incomplete utterance restoration, question generation, and summarization. The observation suggests that the indicators can be beneficial for text generation. We reflect this nature by defining a set of auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we design a model that considers both auxiliary tasks and the main text generation task under the joint training manner. The efficiency of the model is validated in the three generation scenarios. The results of the extensive experiments on 10 datasets for the three scenarios and languages show that the auxiliary tasks significantly contribute to improving the performance of PLMs for the main generation task. The ablation study facilitates the next studies of text generation by showing the behavior of the model in different settings. The model is simple, effective, and flexible for other text generation tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auxiliary Tasks; Joint Training; Pre-trained Language Models; Text Generation; Self-supervised Learning; Auxiliary Task; Down-stream; Joint Training; Language Model; Language Processing; Natural Languages; Performance; Power; Pre-trained Language Model; Text Generations","Self-supervised learning; Auxiliary task; Down-stream; Joint training; Language model; Language processing; Natural languages; Performance; Power; Pre-trained language model; Text generations","","","This work was supported by Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam, under the grant number B2024-SKH-01.","Ouyang, Long, Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, (2022); Yu, Wenhao, A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Text Generation, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 11 s, (2022); IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (2023); Yuan, Weizhe, BARTSCORE: Evaluating Generated Text as Text Generation, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 27263-27277, (2021); Pan, Zhufeng, Improving open-domain dialogue systems via multi-turn incomplete utterance restoration, pp. 1824-1833, (2019); Inoue, Shumpei, Enhance Incomplete Utterance Restoration by Joint Learning Token Extraction and Text Generation, pp. 3149-3158, (2022); Jia, Xin, How to ask good questions?

Firstly, the sub-optimal distribution of data points within the latent space makes normal behavioral regions verbose and indistinguishable from abnormal regions. Secondly, within the latent space, it can be difficult to identify meaningful, separable, and indicative features. Finally, the processing time at the inference stage is still relatively slow. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of network anomaly detection mechanisms by proposing two novel deep hierarchical representation learning models: Deep Nested Clustering Auto-Encoder (DNCAE) and Deep Clustering Hierarchical Auto-Encoder (DCHAE). Both models adopt a nested branch structure, utilizing dual deep auto-encoders to establish hierarchical latent spaces; in each, clustering algorithms are used to spatially optimize and refine the data points. This approach results in improved separation between normal and abnormal data points, and easier identification of notable and/or indicative features. To ascertain the effectiveness of the approach and the quality of resulting features, both models were used in conjunction with ten different one-class anomaly detectors.

When aiming to promote solidarity behavior, it is important to be aware of the prosocial perception-behavior gap, and consider different strategies for males and females, including paying more attention to evoking moral emotions in women. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Crisis; Gender; Solidarity Behavior; Solidarity Perception","","","","We would like to thank all respondents who participated in our research project \u201CSolidarity during the Covid-19 outbreak: Evidence from an experimental survey from Vietnam\u201D implemented in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank Institute.

This study aimed to elucidate the droplet detachment mechanism in MCAW using numerical simulations. It was observed that in the initial stage of droplet growth, the argon arc attachment (which carried a large portion of the current) was located on the metal sheath surrounding the unmelted flux. Moreover, an eddy containing an upward flow at the wire axis was formed inside the droplet. When this eddy was formed, the droplet volume increased owing to wire melting. However, neck formation did not occur. This is considered to be because only a small portion of the current is conducted through the droplet, and the Lorentz force acting on the droplet is significantly weak. Thereafter, when the droplet grew to a certain extent and the arc attachment moved below the unmelted flux position, the Lorentz force acted strongly and almost uniformly on the droplet. Accordingly, this eddy disappeared, and the flow abruptly transitioned to a downward unidirectional high-speed flow. Consequently, the droplet began to extend downward to form a neck, which caused it to detach. For these reasons, the time required for droplet detachment increased, and the metal transfer frequency decreased compared with the case of the solid wire. This explains the observation that globular transfer persists in metal-cored wires at currents higher than those for which the transition to spray transfer has occurred for solid wires. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Argon; Gas Metal Arc Welding; Gas Welding; Lorentz Force; Wire; 'current; Arc Attachment; Arc-welding; Argon Gas; Droplet Detachment; Globular Transfer; Metal Cored Wires; Solid Wires; Spray Transfer; Transfer Modes; Drops","Argon; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Lorentz force; Wire; 'current; Arc attachment; Arc-welding; Argon gas; Droplet detachment; Globular transfer; Metal cored wires; Solid wires; Spray transfer; Transfer modes; Drops","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University .; Funding text 2: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

The welding process was carried out at a welding current of 190, 220, 250, 280, and 310 A under an argon–CO<inf>2</inf> shielding gas mixture with six levels of CO<inf>2</inf> concentration of 0, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % for a parametric study. Unlike the conventional solid wire welding trend, where the droplet transfer frequency decreases with the increase in carbon dioxide concentration, an increase in metal transfer frequency was observed with the increase in CO<inf>2</inf> concentration from approximately 5 % to 20 %. The concentration reaching the maximum frequency was 20 % at 190 A, which decreased as the welding current increased, reaching 5 % at 310 A. Droplet initiation at the lower sheath end is succeeded by a gradual downward movement along the flux column's side after a few milliseconds. Upon reaching the lower end, the droplet forms a neck and undergoes separation. Thus, the length of the flux column directly impacts the duration of one droplet transfer cycle. The length was decreased by arc constriction when increasing CO<inf>2</inf> concentration appropriately to concentrate beneath the flux column or by increasing the welding current to raise the arc temperature, which contributed to melting and shortening the flux column. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arc Plasma; Flux Column; Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfer; Metal Vapor; Rutile Flux-cored Wire; Shielding Gas; Argon; Carbon Dioxide; Drops; Gas Metal Arc Welding; Gas Welding; Laser Beam Welding; Oxide Minerals; Shielding; Titanium Alloys; Wire; Arc Plasma; Arc-welding; Co 2 Concentration; Droplet Transfer; Flux Column; Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfers; Metal Vapor; Rutile Flux Cored Wires; Shielding Gas; Titanium Dioxide","Argon; Carbon dioxide; Drops; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Laser beam welding; Oxide minerals; Shielding; Titanium alloys; Wire; Arc plasma; Arc-welding; CO 2 concentration; Droplet transfer; Flux column; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfers; Metal vapor; Rutile flux cored wires; Shielding gas; Titanium dioxide","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

This study examines the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and their facets, two theoretically distinct measures of religiosity, and twelve other personality traits across seven religious affiliations and 61 countries/regions. The proportion of participants following a religion varied substantially across countries (e.g., Indonesia = 99%; Estonia = 7%). Both measures of religiosity were related to agreeableness, conscientiousness, happiness, and fairness; however; relations with religiosity as a social axiom were stronger and less variable across religious affiliations. Additionally, personality-religiosity links were more robust in low-development, high-conflict, and collectivist nations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Country Variation; Personality Traits; Religiosity; Religious Affiliations","","","","","Personality Disorders and the Five Factor Model of Personality, (2013); Allport, Gordon W., Personal religious orientation and prejudice, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 4, pp. 432-443, (1967); Knowledge and Research in Applied Psychology, (2008); Ashton, Michael C., Religiousness and the HEXACO personality factors and facets in a large online sample, Journal of Personality, 87, 6, pp. 1103-1118, (2019); Cohen, Adam B., Many Forms of Culture, American Psychologist, 64, 3, pp. 194-204, (2009); Cohen, Patricia R., The problem of units and the circumstance for POMP, Multivariate Behavioral Research, 34, 3, pp. 315-346, (1999); Croucher, Stephen Michael, The effects of self-construal and religiousness on argumentativeness: A cross-cultural analysis, Communication Studies, 61, 2, pp. 135-155, (2010); Çukur, Cem Şafak, Religiosity, values, and horizontal and vertical individualism—collectivism: A study of turkey, the united states, and the philippines, Journal of Social Psychology, 144, 6, pp. 613-634, (2004); de Raad, Boele, Cross-culturally recurrent personality factors: Analyses of three factors, European Journal of Personality, 19, 6, pp. 451-474, (2005); Psi Chi Journal of Undergraduate Research, (2010)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10957251; 00926566","","JRPRA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193580679"

Herein, we present cases of BMS in which the remaining uncomfortable sensations improved with perospirone augmentation with clonazepam. Case 1: A 61-year-old man complained of a burning pain in his tongue, a sensation of dryness and discomfort as if his tongue was sticking to a palatal plate. With the diagnosis of BMS, psychopharmacotherapy was initiated with amitriptyline. At the dose of amitriptyline 50 mg, the pain lessened but uncomfortable sensations persisted. Further attempts to alleviate symptoms by combining aripiprazole with amitriptyline, aripiprazole with mirtazapine, or aripiprazole with clonazepam were limited; however, nearly all symptoms were relieved by a combination of perospirone 8.0 mg with clonazepam 1.5 mg. Case 2: A 51-year-old woman complained of a burning sensation along with oral dryness and crumb-like feeling on her tongue. She was diagnosed with BMS and began treatment with amitriptyline. Her burning sensation improved at the dose of 25 mg, but uncomfortable sensations persisted. Augmentation of amitriptyline with aripiprazole, aripiprazole either with valproate, mirtazapine, or clonazepam failed to produce a significant improvement. However, a regimen of perospirone 6.0 mg and clonazepam 1.5 mg relieved the crumb-like sensation and pain and culminated in a stabilized condition. The reported cases suggested that multiple approaches targeting the dopaminergic circuit in basal ganglia involving the serotoninergic and GABA systems, through the administration of perospirone with clonazepam is an effective adjunctive treatment for the remaining uncomfortable sensations in patients with BMS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amitriptyline; Burning Mouth Syndrome; Clonazepam; Dopamine; Perospirone; Serotonin; Amitriptyline; Aripiprazole; Clonazepam; Lubiprostone; Magnesium Oxide; Mirtazapine; Perospirone; Pregabalin; Valproic Acid; Clonazepam; Gaba Modulators; Isoindoles; Perospirone; Thiazoles; Amitriptyline; Antifungal Agent; Aripiprazole; Clonazepam; Lubiprostone; Magnesium Oxide; Mirtazapine; Perospirone; Pregabalin; Valproic Acid; Benzodiazepine Receptor Affecting Agent; Isoindole Derivative; Thiazole Derivative; Adult; Adverse Drug Reaction; Airway Obstruction; Antifungal Therapy; Article; Burning Mouth Syndrome; Burning Sensation; Case Report; Clinical Article; Clinical Feature; Combination Drug Therapy; Comorbidity; Constipation; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Depression; Drug Efficacy; Female; Follow Up; Head And Neck Disease; Heart Infarction; Human; Hyperlipidemia; Hypertension; Idiopathic Disease; Lockdown; Low Back Pain; Male; Middle Aged; Migraine; Mouth Discomfort; Myalgia; Nociception; Occlusal Adjustment; Pandemic; Perception Deafness; Psychopharmacotherapy; Treatment Failure; Treatment Resistant Burning Mouth Syndrome; Xerostomia; Zung Self Rating Depression Scale; Drug Therapy; Burning Mouth Syndrome; Clonazepam; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Gaba Modulators; Humans; Isoindoles; Male; Middle Aged; Thiazoles","amitriptyline; antifungal agent; aripiprazole; clonazepam; lubiprostone; magnesium oxide; mirtazapine; perospirone; pregabalin; valproic acid; benzodiazepine receptor affecting agent; isoindole derivative; thiazole derivative; adult; adverse drug reaction; airway obstruction; antifungal therapy; Article; burning mouth syndrome; burning sensation; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; combination drug therapy; comorbidity; constipation; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; drug efficacy; female; follow up; head and neck disease; heart infarction; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; idiopathic disease; lockdown; low back pain; male; middle aged; migraine; mouth discomfort; myalgia; nociception; occlusal adjustment; pandemic; perception deafness; psychopharmacotherapy; treatment failure; treatment resistant burning mouth syndrome; xerostomia; Zung Self Rating Depression Scale; drug therapy; Burning Mouth Syndrome; Clonazepam; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; GABA Modulators; Humans; Isoindoles; Male; Middle Aged; Thiazoles","","amitriptyline, 50-48-6, 549-18-8; aripiprazole, 129722-12-9; clonazepam, 1622-61-3; lubiprostone, 136790-76-6, 333963-40-9; magnesium oxide, 1309-48-4, 1317-74-4; mirtazapine, 61337-67-5, 85650-52-8; perospirone, 105981-50-8, 105981-51-9, 129273-38-7, 150915-41-6; pregabalin, 148553-50-8; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1; Clonazepam; GABA Modulators; Isoindoles; perospirone; Thiazoles","","Toyofuku, Akira, Psychosomatic problems in dentistry, BioPsychoSocial Medicine, 10, 1, (2016); Umezaki, Yojiro, Oral cenesthopathy, BioPsychoSocial Medicine, 10, 1, (2016); Umezaki, Yojiro, Clinical characteristics and course of oral somatic delusions: A retrospective chart review of 606 cases in 5 years, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 14, pp. 2057-2065, (2018); Takenoshita, Miho, Low-Dose Aripiprazole Augmentation in Amitriptyline-Resistant Burning Mouth Syndrome: Results from Two Cases, Pain Medicine (United States), 18, 4, pp. 814-815, (2017); Cui, Yuan, Efficacy evaluation of clonazepam for symptom remission in burning mouth syndrome: a meta-analysis, Oral Diseases, 22, 6, pp. 503-511, (2016); Seishinka Chiryogaku, (2008); Onrust, Susan V., Perospirone, CNS Drugs, 15, 4, pp. 329-337, (2001); Goodnick, Paul J., Aripiprazole: Profile on efficacy and safety, Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy, 3, 12, pp. 1773-1781, (2002); Berthet, Pierre, Action selection performance of a reconfigurable Basal Ganglia inspired model with Hebbian-Bayesian Go-NoGo connectivity, Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, SEPTEMBER, (2012); Jpn J Psychosom Med, (2020)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","2574173X","","","38500267","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188446547"

Objective: This study investigated the association between malodor and dementia. Methods: We used the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study data obtained at Yokote City. A total of 1,493 individuals aged 56 to 75 years underwent a dental examination and self-reported survey from May 2005 to January 2006. Follow-up for the onset of dementia was conducted using long-term care insurance data from 2006 to 2016. Hazard ratios of oral malodor on dementia were estimated by the Cox proportional hazards model. The inverse probability-weighted Cox model was used as a sensitivity analysis. Results: The study comprised 1493 participants (53.6% women) with a mean age of 65.6 (SD = 5.8) years old; at the end of the follow-up, 6.4% (n = 96) developed dementia, and the percentage was 20.7 in severe malodor group. Throughout 15274.133 person-years of follow-up, the average incidence rate for the onset of dementia per 1000 person-years was 6.29. The highest incidence rate was seen in participants with severe malodor (22.4 per 1000 person-years). After adjusting for confounders, compared to those with no malodor, there was a 3.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 9.4) times greater hazard of developing dementia in participants with severe malodor. The inverse probability weighted Cox model confirmed the same trend with an adjusted marginal hazard ratio of 4.4 (1.2 to 16.4). CONCLUSIONS: A significant association between oral malodor and the onset of dementia exists. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alzheimer's Disease; Dementia; Oral Health; Oral Malodor; Adult; Age; Aged; Article; Cohort Analysis; Comparative Study; Confounding Variable; Dementia; Dental Examination; Dental Health; Disease Association; Disease Severity; Female; Follow Up; Halitosis; Health Survey; Human; Incidence; Japan; Long Term Care Insurance; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Aged; Self Report; Sensitivity Analysis; Sex; Survival Rate; Trend Study","adult; age; aged; Article; cohort analysis; comparative study; confounding variable; dementia; dental examination; dental health; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; halitosis; health survey; human; incidence; Japan; long term care insurance; major clinical study; male; middle aged; self report; sensitivity analysis; sex; survival rate; trend study","","","Funding text 1: The authors thank all staff members of the JPHC Study in each study area and central office for their extensive efforts in conducting the baseline survey and oral health study.

We tested whether this regressive shift was more acutely perceived and experienced by women in countries with greater gender equality. Cross-cultural longitudinal survey data for women and men (N = 10,238) was collected weekly during the first few months of the pandemic. Multilevel modelling analyses, based on seven waves of data collection, indicated that a regressive shift was broadly perceived but not uniformly felt. Women and men alike perceived a shift toward a more traditional division of household labor during the first few weeks of the pandemic. However, this perception only undermined women’s satisfaction with their personal relationships and subjective mental health if they lived in countries with higher levels of economic gender equality. Among women in countries with lower levels of economic gender equality, the perceived shift predicted higher relationship satisfaction and mental health. There were no such effects among men. Taken together, our results suggest that subjective perceptions of disempowerment, and the gender role norms that underpin them, should be considered when examining the gendered impact of global crisis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Division Of Labor; Gender Equality; Gender Roles; Interpersonal Relationships; Relationship Quality; Well Being","","","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions This work was funded, in part, by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada awarded to the first author as well as a European Commission Grant (725128) awarded to the second author.","Aarntzen, Lianne, Work-family guilt as a straightjacket.

The results show that per capita income, social support, and freedom to make life choices positively impact happiness, while air pollution exposure has a negative impact. However, gender inequality does not significantly affect happiness levels.

Method: In this study, we examined the mediators of the relationship between individualism measured at the country level and parental burnout measured at the individual level in 36 countries (16,059 parents). Results: The results revealed three mediating mechanisms, that is, self-discrepancies between socially prescribed and actual parental selves, high agency and self-directed socialization goals, and low parental task sharing, by which individualism leads to an increased risk of burnout among parents. Conclusion: The results confirm that the three mediators under consideration are all involved, and that mediation was higher for self-discrepancies between socially prescribed and actual parental selves, then parental task sharing, and lastly self-directed socialization goals. The results provide some important indications of how to prevent parental burnout at the societal level in Western countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Exhaustion; Fathers; Individualism; Mothers; Burnout; Child; Child Parent Relation; Epidemiology; Human; Professional Burnout; Socialization; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological; Child; Humans; Parents; Socialization","burnout; child; child parent relation; epidemiology; human; professional burnout; socialization; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological; Child; Humans; Parents; Socialization","","","IR and MM were supported by a Coordinated Research Grant from the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles in Belgium (ARC Grant n°19/24-100).

While most studies are qualitative studies and there has been little validation in quantitative studies using scales to measure spirituality. Hence, we aimed to study the effect of spirituality on mental health and QoL in older people residing in Kumejima Town in Japan. Methods: An interview-based survey was conducted between September 2010 and 2011 on residents of Kumejima Town aged 65 years or older. This survey-based study employed the Spirituality Health Scale for the Elderly (SP Health Scale) alongside assessments of basic attributes (e.g., age, sex); physical, mental, social health, spirituality, and QoL. We conducted a causal structure model to explore causal relationships between these factors. Results: Our study included 338 participants, including 72.5% female with an average age and standard deviation of 77.2 ± 6.4 years. Our analysis revealed a significant association between spiritual health and QoL even after accounting for the impact of physical and mental health, which challenged the conventional belief that QoL inevitably diminishes with age and declining health. These results suggest that enhancing spirituality may offer a means to prevent declines in QoL, fostering a positive outlook on life as individuals age. Conclusion: Our study suggests that improving spiritual health can enhance QoL, even in the presence of health challenges and aging. This novel perspective opens doors to redefining health as a state that coexists with illness, with spirituality serving as an integral component. A shift in our understanding of health that prioritizes spirituality, could benefit people of all ages, offering a more holistic approach to well-being that aligns with new medical technologies and evolving perceptions of health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Health; Quality Of Life; Spirituality","","","","","Basic Documents, (2020); McCartney, Gerry, Defining health and health inequalities, Public Health, 172, pp. 22-30, (2019); 1st International Conference on Health Promotion Ottawa, (1986); Pharmacoecon Outcomes News, (2021); Huber, Machteld, How should we define health?, BMJ, 343, 7817, (2011); Fifty Second World Health Assembly Geneva 17 25 May 1999 Summary Records of Committees and Ministerial Round Tables Reports of Committees, (1999); de Brito Sena, Marina Aline, Defining Spirituality in Healthcare: A Systematic Review and Conceptual Framework, Frontiers in Psychology, 12, (2021); Proc Bayl Univ Med Cent, (2001); Man S Search for Meaning, (1963); Foglio, John P., Religion, faith, and family medicine, Journal of Family Practice, 27, 5, pp. 473-474, (1988)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22549625; 21748144","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188843649"

However, numerous studies on RHS's impact on private modes’ usage provide inconclusive evidence. Notably, few studies have analyzed RHS's impacts on modal changes in the context of motorcycle-based societies. This study attempts to identify the critical factors affecting RHS users’ private mode usage (private cars and motorcycles) in response to RHS appearance in Hanoi, Vietnam, a motorcycle-based society. Two empirical analyses were performed with sample data of 642 individuals collected from face-to-face interviews using paper-based questionnaire sheets in Hanoi from December 19 to 21, 2020. The first analysis employed a linear regression model to explain the changes in individuals’ private mode usage before and after RHS adoption. The second analysis estimated a logistic regression model to examine an individual's private mode choice when RHS are unavailable. Robustness tests were also performed. The results revealed that RHS users’ future vehicle ownership intentions, reasons for using RHS instead of private modes, motorcycle ownership, and public transport usage significantly reduce the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. The reasons for using RHS rather than private modes were found not strong enough to make an essential change to reduce the frequency of private modes usage. The results also showed there is a difference between the RHS's impacts on motorcycle use and car use. They suggested that policy makers should be aware of the unique factors in motorcycle-based societies such as Hanoi when formulating urban transportation strategies. Finally, the findings further supported an idea that multivariate analyses are more suitable than the simple descriptive statistics method to understand how the motivation for using RHS influences the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Modal Choice; Motorcycle-based Society; Private Mode; Ride-hailing Service","","","","Funding text 1: This study was financially supported by the Kajima Foundation’s International Joint Research Grant.; Funding text 2: We appreciate Dr. Saksith Chalermpong and Dr. Phathinan Thaithatkul (Chulalongkorn University) for sharing the basic design of the questionnaire survey of ride-hailing services.

We drew on health behavior theories to predict health-protective (coping-specific) responses and hope (coping non-specific response) from health-related cognitions (vulnerability, severity, self-assessed knowledge, efficacy). In an extension of this model, we proposed orientation to internal (problem-focused coping) and external (country capability) coping resources as antecedents of health protection and hope; health-related cognitions were assumed as mediators of this link. We tested these predictions in a large multi-national multi-wave study with a cross-sectional panel at T1 (Baseline, March-April 2020; N = 57,631 in 113 countries) and a panel subsample at two later time points, T2 (November 2020; N = 3097) and T3 (April 2021; N = 2628). Multilevel models showed that health-related cognitions predicted health-protective responses and hope. Problem-focused coping was mainly linked to health-protective behaviors (T1-T3), whereas country capability was mainly linked to hope (T1-T3). These relationships were partially mediated by health-related cognitions. We conceptually replicated predictions of health behavior theories within a real health threat, further suggesting how different coping resources are associated with qualitatively distinct outcomes. Both patterns were consistent across countries and time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coping; Country Capability; Covid-19; Health Behavior Theories; Hope; Problem-focused Coping; Virus Mitigation Behavior","","","","Funding text 1: This research received financial support from the New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75\u201371015) to Jocelyn J.

In the traditional utility-based framework, the mining result is influenced by the number of items in a pattern, or in some cases, single utilities of items. In order to overcome this drawback, high average utility pattern mining has been proposed. It provides more interesting results since it takes into account the average utility of patterns by considering their lengths. Methods based on this concept have emerged in recent years, including ones that target incremental environments. However, existing algorithms create an enormous number of candidate patterns or require complex operations during the mining process. To address this degradation, we propose a new and more efficient approach for mining high average utility patterns in dynamic environments. The proposed algorithm utilizes a data structure more efficient than previous ones, which takes the form of an indexed list. It also incorporates efficient realigning and mining techniques for handling incremental data and accurately mining results. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of runtime, memory usage, scalability, and accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Mining; Dynamic Data Mining; High Average Utility Patterns; Indexed List Based Structure; Pattern Pruning; Data Handling; Average Utilities; Candidate Patterns; Dynamic Data Mining; Dynamic Environments; High Average Utility Pattern; Indexed List Based Structure; Pattern Mining; Pattern Pruning; Real-world Database; Utility-based Framework; Data Mining","Data handling; Average utilities; Candidate patterns; Dynamic data mining; Dynamic environments; High average utility pattern; Indexed list based structure; Pattern mining; Pattern pruning; Real-world database; Utility-based framework; Data mining","","","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF No. 2021R1A2C1009388 ).","Al-Bana, Mohamed Reda, An Efficient Spark-Based Hybrid Frequent Itemset Mining Algorithm for Big Data, Data, 7, 1, (2022); Bui, Huong, A Sliding Window-Based Approach for Mining Frequent Weighted Patterns over Data Streams, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 56318-56329, (2021); Cai, Saihua, MWFP-outlier: Maximal weighted frequent-pattern-based approach for detecting outliers from uncertain weighted data streams, Information Sciences, 591, pp. 195-225, (2022); Cariou, Claude, A Novel Mean-Shift Algorithm for Data Clustering, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 14575-14585, (2022); Fan, Chinglung, Data mining model for predicting the quality level and classification of construction projects, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 42, 1, pp. 139-153, (2022); Gionis, Aristides, Assessing data mining results via swap randomization, ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, 1, 3, (2007); Hong, Tzung Pei, Effective utility mining with the measure of average utility, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 7, pp. 8259-8265, (2011); Huynh, Huy M., An efficient parallel algorithm for mining weighted clickstream patterns, Information Sciences, 582, pp. 349-368, (2022); Khedr, Ahmed Mohamed, An efficient association rule mining from distributed medical databases for predicting heart diseases, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 15320-15333, (2021); Kim, Donggyu, Efficient algorithm for mining high average-utility itemsets in incremental transaction databases, Applied Intelligence, 47, 1, pp. 114-131, (2017)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178661007"

In a large-scale collaboration spanning 60 countries (Ntotal = 21,513), we examined the CAS’s measurement invariance and assessed the convergent validity of CAS scores in relation to the fear of COVID-19(FCV-19S) and the satisfaction with life (SWLS-3) scales. We utilized both conventional exact invariance tests and alignmentprocedures,with results revealing that the single-factor model fit the data well in almost all countries. Partial scalar invariance was supported in a subset of 56 countries. To ensure the robustness of results, given the unbalanced samples, we employed resampling techniques both with and without replacement and found the results were more stable in larger samples. The alignment procedure demonstrated a high degree of measurement invariance with 9% of the parameters exhibiting non-invariance. Wealso conducted simulations of alignment using the parameters estimated in the current model. Findings demonstrated reliability of the means but indicated challenges in estimating the latent variances. Strong positive correlations between CAS and FCV-19S estimated with all three different approaches were found in most countries.

Unicast causes congestion, wasted bandwidth, and poor scalability. Reliable multicast protocols address these challenges by enabling simultaneous data transmission to multiple destinations, reducing both network traffic and resource consumption. However, loss recovery remains a critical issue, as delays can significantly impact overall performance. We propose a new scheme that leverages programmable data plane-enabled switches, such as P4-enabled switches, to detect and retransmit packet losses at each switch. In this scheme, the receiving node (switch) detects lost packets in real-time and requests retransmissions from the neighboring nodes. The scheme operates transparently between source and destination hosts, making it compatible with existing networks and applicable to any network application or protocol. Simulations using ns-3 demonstrate that our scheme significantly improves the completion time of file transfers based on reliable multicast protocols in high link loss scenarios. For example, it reduces completion time by up to 36% when delivering a 1 GB file from one source to 40 sinks with a link loss rate of 0.01. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Loss Detection; Loss Recovery; Ns-3; P4; Programmable Data Plane; Sdn; Internet Of Things; Internet Protocols; Multicasting; Packet Switching; Time Switches; Traffic Congestion; Completion Time; Data Planes; Data-plane; Loss Detection; Loss Recovery; Ns-3; Programmable Data Plane; Real- Time; Reliable Multicast Protocols; Sdn; Packet Loss","Internet of things; Internet protocols; Multicasting; Packet switching; Time switches; Traffic congestion; Completion time; Data planes; Data-plane; Loss detection; Loss recovery; Ns-3; Programmable data plane; Real- time; Reliable multicast protocols; SDN; Packet loss","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2023-18-01.","Reliable Multicast Transport Building Blocks for One to Many Bulk Data Transfer, (2024); Zhuo, Danyang, Understanding and mitigating packet corruption in data center networks, pp. 362-375, (2017); Uftp Encrypted Udp Based Ftp with Multicast, (2024); Jiang, Xiaoke, A survey on Information-centric Networking: Rationales, designs and debates, China Communications, 12, 7, pp. 1-12, (2015); Duan, Yingjie, A Dynamic Cache Allocation Mechanism (DCAM) for Reliable Multicast in Information-Centric Networking, Future Internet, 14, 4, (2022); Joshi, Raj, Masking Corruption Packet Losses in Datacenter Networks with Link-local Retransmission, pp. 288-304, (2023); Programming Protocol Independent Packet Processors P4, (2024); Network Simulator 3, (2024); Ha, Nguyen Viet, TCP with Network Coding Enhanced in Bi-Directional Loss Tolerance, IEEE Communications Letters, 24, 3, pp. 520-524, (2020); Mmb, (2008)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","10th IEEE Information Technology International Seminar, ITIS 2024","","Surabaya","206307","","9798331521295","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218222010"

Despite its promises, FL is prone to critical security risks. First, because FL depends on a central server to aggregate local training models, this is a single point of failure. The server might function maliciously. Second, due to its distributed nature, FL might encounter backdoor attacks by participating clients. They can poison the local model before submitting to the server. Either type of attack, on the server or the client side, would severely degrade learning accuracy. We propose FedBlock, a novel blockchain-based FL framework that addresses both of these security risks. FedBlock is uniquely desirable in that it involves only smart contract programming, thus deployable atop any blockchain network. Our framework is substantiated with a comprehensive evaluation study using real-world datasets. Its robustness against backdoor attacks is competitive with the literature of FL backdoor defense. The latter, however, does not address the server risk as we do. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Backdoor Attacks; Blockchain; Decentralized Computing; Federated Learning; Adversarial Machine Learning; Backdoor Attack; Backdoors; Block-chain; Central Servers; Decentralised; Decentralized Computing; Local Training; Machine Learning Methods; Private Data; Security Risks; Federated Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Backdoor attack; Backdoors; Block-chain; Central servers; Decentralised; Decentralized computing; Local training; Machine learning methods; Private data; Security risks; Federated learning","","","This work was supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under project code VINIF.2021.DA00128.","McMahan, H.

However, KAN assessment is still limited and cannot provide an in-depth analysis of a specific domain. Furthermore, no study has been conducted on the implementation of KANs in hardware design, which would directly demonstrate whether KANs are truly superior to MLPs in practical applications. As a result, in this paper, we focus on verifying KANs for classification issues, which are a common but significant topic in AI using four different types of datasets. Furthermore, the corresponding hardware implementation is considered using the Vitis high-level synthesis (HLS) tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to implement hardware for KAN. The results indicate that KANs cannot achieve more accuracy than MLPs in high complex datasets while utilizing substantially higher hardware resources. Therefore, MLP remains an effective approach for achieving accuracy and efficiency in software and hardware implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Fpga; Hardware; Kan; Kolmogorov-arnold Networks; Neural Networks; Digital Storage; Hardware; Hardware Implementations; Kolmogorov; Kolmogorov-arnold Network; Multi-layer Perception; Neural-networks; Software Training; Software/hardware; Multilayer Neural Networks","Digital storage; Hardware; Hardware implementations; Kolmogorov; Kolmogorov-arnold network; Multi-layer perception; Neural-networks; Software training; Software/hardware; Multilayer neural networks","","","This work was supported by JST-ALCA-Next Program Grant Number JPMJAN23F4, Japan.

Therefore, it is becoming increasingly necessary to prioritize countermeasures that can improve the security level of these implementations. A Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCM) primitive has been utilized in several time-based hiding countermeasures against side-channel attacks. However, they cannot be applied to ASIC implementations because the MMCM is a Xilinx primitive. Consequently, this paper proposes a hybrid dynamic Gold code-based solution to generate multiple different frequencies. The countermeasure combines a pair of preferred polynomials with one ring oscillator, so it is suitable for both FPGA and ASIC designs. The hardware overhead of our suggested architecture is 1.007× and 1.009× in terms of slice LUTs and registers, respectively. The total area cost of the circuit on the CMOS 0.18 um process is 398,835 square micrometers, representing a 1.004x increase compared to the unprotected case. Moreover, the approach is resistant to both standard and sliding window-based Correlation Power Analysis attacks, even when employing UP to one million power traces. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Countermeasure; Horizontal Hiding; Random Number Generator; Side-channel Attacks; Cmos Integrated Circuits; Hardware Security; Radiation Hardening; Countermeasure; Cryptographics; Gold Codes; Hardware Implementations; Horizontal Hiding; Hybrid Dynamics; Mixed Mode; Random Number Generators; Security Level; Side-channel Attacks; Random Number Generation","CMOS integrated circuits; Hardware security; Radiation hardening; Countermeasure; CryptoGraphics; Gold codes; Hardware implementations; Horizontal hiding; Hybrid dynamics; Mixed mode; Random number generators; Security level; Side-channel attacks; Random number generation","","","","Johnson, Anju P., An Improved DCM-Based Tunable True Random Number Generator for Xilinx FPGA, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, 64, 4, pp. 452-456, (2017); Jayasinghe, Darshana, RFTC: Runtime frequency tuning countermeasure using FPGA dynamic reconfiguration to mitigate power analysis attacks, (2019); Hettwer, Benjamin, Lightweight Side-Channel Protection using Dynamic Clock Randomization, pp. 200-207, (2020); Jayasinghe, Darshana, SCRIP: Secure random clock execution on soft processor systems to mitigate power-based side channel attacks, IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, Digest of Technical Papers, 2019-November, (2019); Proc Int Symp Found Pract Secu Fps, (2022); Tran, Thai Ha, Dynamic Gold Code-Based Chaotic Clock for Cryptographic Designs to Counter Power Analysis Attacks, pp. 439-442, (2023); Torrieri, Don J., Principles of spread-spectrum communication systems, pp. 1-444, (2005); Wireless Communication Systems in Matlab, (2020); Dubrova, Elena V., Finding matching initial states for equivalent NLFSRs in the Fibonacci and the Galois configurations, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 56, 6, pp. 2961-2966, (2010); Fujieda, Naoki, An Analysis of DCM-Based True Random Number Generator, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, 67, 6, pp. 1109-1113, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity; TATA Consultancy Services; TPG Telecom; University of New Brunswick; University of New South Wales (UNSW)","21st Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust, PST 2024","","Sydney; NSW; University of New South Wales (UNSW) Campus","205276","","9798350367096","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216585957"

Since 2014, the Japanese government has mandated regular inspections of major urban infrastructure. This policy has resulted in the annual accumulation of substantial amounts of infrastructure inspection data. Two years prior to implementing this policy, the Japanese government also launched an open data initiative to encourage industry developers to utilize open data. However, this study observes that inconsistencies in data formatting and standards across different regions pose significant challenges to the utilization of this data. To address the obstacles hindering the use of open data, this study proposes an integrated system(Service Link Platform) for effectively managing and utilizing periodic transportation infrastructure inspection data which encompasses data collection, data format processing, cloud storage and transmission, and data utilization. This article will layout the manner in which the system employs a method for distributing data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format to publicly manage bridge inspection data and ensure compatibility of data formats. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Management; Data Visualization; Infrastructure Management; Open Data; Web Api; Cloud Storages; Cloud Visualization; Data Utilization; Economic Growths; Infrastructure Development; Infrastructure Managements; Integrated Systems; Regular Inspections; Urban Infrastructure; Web Api; Data Assimilation","Cloud storages; Cloud visualization; Data utilization; Economic growths; Infrastructure development; Infrastructure managements; Integrated systems; Regular inspections; Urban infrastructure; Web API; Data assimilation","","","","Formulation of Periodic Inspection Guidelines, (2014); Promoting Flexible Use of Open Data Through Service Link Platform for Infrastructure Management, (2023); Proceedings of Information Science and Technology, (2020); Proceedings of AI and Data Science, (2020); Proceedings of AI and Data Science, (2022); A Study on Open Dataization and Utilization of Infrastructure Maintenance Management Data for Open Innovation in Social Infrastructure Facilities, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","Joint 13th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems and 25th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems, SCIS and ISIS 2024","","Himeji","204675","","9798350373332","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214709939"

Men and women in 15 countries (NTOTAL = 4701) completed self-report measures assessing self-esteem and the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-defeating, and self-enhancing. Each of the country samples had self-esteem averages at or above the midpoint of the scale, but did vary. The samples from Colombia and Serbia had the highest self-esteem values and Russia had the lowest. For all of the country samples, with the exception of Russia, the multiple regression results demonstrated that a greater level of the self-enhancing humor style positively predicted higher self-esteem scores. As the self-enhancing humor style involves improving one’s mood with humor, the results suggest that for the majority of the participants, self-enhancing humor styles also help to increase self-esteem. The results are discussed both within countries and across the samples. In particular, the unique finding that not a self-enhancing humor style but an aggressive humor style predicts self-esteem in the Russian sample is discussed. The chapter ends with a discussion of how humor styles correlate with mental health indicators and how the understanding of humor style profiles are related to well-being across countries adds to the global understanding of individual differences. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Social Science Research Council Bulletin, (1942); Baumeister, Roy F., Does High Self-Esteem Cause Better Performance, Interpersonal Success, Happiness, or Healthier Lifestyles?, Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, 1, pp. 1-44, (2003); World Applied Sciences Journal, (2007); Brown, Jonathon D., The three faces of self-esteem, pp. 1-9, (2013); Burisch, Matthias, Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits, American Psychologist, 39, 3, pp. 214-227, (1984); Chen, Guohai, A comparison of humor styles, coping humor, and mental health between Chinese and Canadian university students, Humor, 20, 3, pp. 215-234, (2007); Erickson, Sarah J., Adolescent humor and its relationship to coping, defense strategies, psychological distress, and well-being, Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 37, 3, pp. 255-271, (2007); Ford, Thomas E., Personality, humor styles and happiness: Happy people have positive humor styles, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 320-337, (2016); Fox, Claire Louise, Longitudinal associations between humor styles and psychosocial adjustment in adolescence, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 377-389, (2016); Studia Psychologiczne, (2011)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783031522871; 9783031522888","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205640381"

Behavior analysis reveals both general and detailed patterns in the interaction of customers with a store’s items and other people, providing store managers with insight into customer preferences. Several solutions aim to utilize this data by recognizing specific behaviors through statistical visualization. However, current approaches are limited to the analysis of small customer behavior sets, utilizing conventional methods to detect behaviors. They do not use deep learning techniques such as deep neural networks, which are powerful methods in the field of computer vision.

In this study, we propose a framework that includes three primary parts: mathematical modeling of customer behaviors, behavior analysis using an efficient deep learning-based system, and individual and group behavior visualization.

The packet loss in the network, due to link corruption and congestion, causes the performance degradation of many network services, affecting the application experience. Packet loss often happens in both lossy networks like wireless networks and reliable local networks like data center networks. The previous papers proposed methods to estimate the link loss (packet loss on link) and feedback to the controller via the OpenFlow. However, the feedback process passively depends on the scheduled OpenFlow Flow-Stat packet sent from the controller, resulting in late detection and response to the loss events. Besides, the accumulated loss in a path with multiple nodes causes a less accurate estimation at the node far from the measurement host due to insufficient probe packets. Therefore, this paper proposes a new scheme based on programmable data plane-enabled switches, such as the P4-enabled switch, to actively calculate the link loss and send the feedback to the controller. It also ensures the total probe packet at all links always equals the one that departs from the measurement host by supplementing the probe packet to compensate for the loss in the previous link. The simulation on ns-3 shows the efficiency of the proposed scheme in achieving a good accuracy estimation and a short response time to the network state change. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","In-band Network Detection; Link Loss Rate Monitoring; Ns-3; P4; Programmable Data Plane; Sdn; Controllers; Feedback; Probes; Data Planes; Data-plane; In-band; In-band Network Detection; Link Loss; Link Loss Rate Monitoring; Loss Rates; Network Detections; Ns-3; Programmable Data Plane; Rate Monitoring; Sdn; Packet Loss","Controllers; Feedback; Probes; Data planes; Data-plane; In-band; In-band network detection; Link loss; Link loss rate monitoring; Loss rates; Network detections; Ns-3; Programmable data plane; Rate monitoring; SDN; Packet loss","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2023-18-01 for Nguyen Viet Ha and JSPS KAKENHI 20K11770, NICT commissioned research JPJ012368C05501, Japan for Masato Tsuru.","Ha, Nguyen Viet, TCP with Network Coding Enhanced in Bi-Directional Loss Tolerance, IEEE Communications Letters, 24, 3, pp. 520-524, (2020); 5g Fixed Wireless Vs Leo Vs Cable Home Internet Performance Comparison, (2023); Zhuo, Danyang, Understanding and mitigating packet corruption in data center networks, pp. 362-375, (2017); A Simple Network Management Protocol Snmp, (1990); Tri, Nguyen Minh, Effective route scheme of multicast probing to locate high-loss links in openflow networks, Journal of Information Processing, 29, pp. 115-123, (2021); Programming Protocol Independent Packet Processors P4, (2023); Network Simulator 3, (2023); Tri, Nguyen Minh, Locating Deteriorated Links by Network-Assisted Multicast Proving on OpenFlow Networks, Proceedings - International Symposium on Computers and Communications, 2019-June, (2019); Joshi, Raj, Masking Corruption Packet Losses in Datacenter Networks with Link-local Retransmission, pp. 288-304, (2023); Implementing Your Switch Target with Bmv2, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","16th International Conference on Knowledge and Smart Technology, KST 2024","","Krabi; Deevana Plaza Krabi Aonang","198941","","9798350370737","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191655915"

Previous studies have intensively investigated factors influencing opportunism but overfocusing on the organisational level. Recently, supply chain researchers have called for identifying factors influencing opportunism at the individual level to gain a more comprehensive understanding of opportunism. Based on transaction cost theory, resource dependence theory, and boundary spanning theory, this study seeks to advance the emerging research stream on opportunism at the individual level by investigating how buyer agents’ boundary spanning capabilities and firms’ long–term relationship orientation can help manage supplier agents’ opportunism. Using a cross–sectional data set of 406 buyer agents from manufacturing companies collected from February to April 2021 in Japan, we tested a set of hypotheses through regression and conditional process analyses. Our findings suggest that buyer agents’ strategic communication and firms’ long–term relationship orientation are critical factors that reduce supplier agents’ opportunism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boundary Spanning Capability; Inter–firm Relationship; Japan; Long–term Orientation; Opportunism","","","","","Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, (1976); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Akrout, Houcine, Fundamental transformations of trust and its drivers: A multi-stage approach of business-to-business relationships, Industrial Marketing Management, 66, pp. 159-171, (2017); Academy of Management Review, (1977); Aoki, Katsuki, The role of ambidexterity in managing buyer-supplier relationships: The Toyota case, Organization Science, 28, 6, pp. 1080-1097, (2017); Au, Kevin Yuk Fai, Boundary spanning behaviors of expatriates, Journal of World Business, 37, 4, pp. 285-296, (2002); Bals, Lydia, Purchasing and supply management (PSM) competencies: Current and future requirements, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, 5, (2019); Supply Chain Forum an International Journal, (2011); Bhattacharya, Ananya, Antecedents of buyer opportunistic behavior in outsourcing relationships, International Journal of Production Economics, 166, pp. 258-268, (2015); Cai, Shaohan Alan, On boundary spanners and interfirm embeddedness: The role of guanxi institution in China, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 27, 1, (2021)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","16246039; 16258312","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180230509"

This study examined the levels of parents’ engagement in caregiving activities with children aged 36–59 months and the socioeconomic and child-rearing environmental factors. A total of 1035 children and their caregivers were analysed using the Vietnam Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was performed separately for each following outcome caregiving activity: reading books, telling stories, singing songs, naming/counting, taking the child outside, and playing with child. Results showed that fathers’ engagement levels were substantially lower than the mothers’ in all caregiving activities. Reading books and telling stories was among the least frequent activities engaged in by both parents. Results from the logistic regression model showed that parental high education level, richest household wealth, and having adequate learning resources at home were positively associated with parents’ engagement in caregiving activities.

Here, we examined cross-nationally the structure and correlates of these beliefs with an 8-item scale, using a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. We obtained a two-factor model of unfounded (conspiracy and health) beliefs with good internal structure (average CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04), but a high correlation between the two factors (average latent factor correlation = 0.57). This model was replicable across 50 countries (total N = 13,579), as evidenced by metric invariance between countries (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMS = 0.07) as well as scalar invariance across genders (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03) and educational levels (CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04, SRMS = 0.03). Also, lower levels of education, more fear of COVID-19, and more cynicism were weakly associated with stronger conspiracy and health beliefs. The study contributes to knowledge about the structure of unfounded beliefs, and reveals the potential relevance of affective (i.e., fear of COVID-19) and cognitive (i.e., cynicism) factors along with demographics, in endorsing such beliefs. In summary, we obtained cross-cultural evidence for the distinctiveness of unfounded conspiracy and health beliefs about COVID-19 in terms of their structure and correlates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conspiracy Beliefs; Covid-19; Cross-cultural; Health Beliefs; Unfounded Beliefs","","","","The work of Magdalena \u017Bemojtel-Piotrowska and Jaros\u0142aw Piotrowski was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland under Grant [2017/26/E/HS6/00282].

The proposed DCT accelerator utilizes matrix decomposition and replaces traditional multiplications with additions and bit-shifting, enabling an efficient hardware implementation. It supports both square and non-square block sizes, providing flexibility and compatibility with the H.266/VVC standard. The system integrates a NIOS-V CPU based on RISC-V architecture, memory, and DMA to ensure efficient data transfer from video compression pipeline stages like Motion Estimation and Intra/Inter Prediction. Compared to existing solutions, this design overcomes limitations in throughput and block size flexibility, achieving 11,482 Mpixels/s for 64×64 blocks on the DE10 Pro board, supporting 16K video at 60fps.

To contribute to the understanding of predictors of prosociality, we used multilevel models to test three previously established pathways to prosocial behavior, which we call the “broaden and build”, compensation, and incapacity pathways. We also tested whether these three paths are mediated by general wellbeing, and moderated by collective disempowerment, i.e., individuals’ belief that external societal forces have made it harder for people like them to function effectively. Participants from 39 countries (N= 59987) were surveyed on their willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors in the context of the pandemic. The “broaden and build” pathway was supported: positive affect was associated with willingness to engage in prosocial behavior via higher well-being. Two (in)capacity paths were also supported: financial strain and negative affect were both negatively associated with prosociality via lower well-being. A compensation pathway was also observed: Controlling for lower well-being, negative affect was associated with greater prosociality. Finally, differences in disempowerment moderated the affective pathways: higher disempowerment strengthened the positive association of positive affect with prosociality via well-being, and buffered the negative affect incapacity path. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Afecto; Affect; Bienestar; Collective Disempowerment; Comportamiento Prosocial; Covid-19; Covid-19; Desempoderamiento Colectivo; Prosocial Behavior; Well-being","","","","","Abdel-Khalek, Ahmed M., Measuring happiness with a single-item scale, Social Behavior and Personality, 34, 2, pp. 139-150, (2006); Dataversenl, (2022); Baumann, Donald J., Altruism as hedonism: Helping and self-gratification as equivalent responses, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 40, 6, pp. 1039-1046, (1981); Brittian Loyd, Aerika, Associations Between Adolescents' Perceived Discrimination and Prosocial Tendencies: The Mediating Role of Mexican American Values, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 42, 3, pp. 328-341, (2013); Carlson, Michael, Positive Mood and Helping Behavior: A Test of Six Hypotheses, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55, 2, pp. 211-229, (1988); Chen, Xueyi, Bidirectional Relations Between Subjective Well-Being in School and Prosocial Behavior Among Elementary School-Aged Children: A Longitudinal Study, Child and Youth Care Forum, 49, 1, pp. 77-95, (2020); Cialdini, Robert B., Reinterpreting the Empathy-Altruism Relationship: When One into One Equals Oneness, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, 3, pp. 481-494, (1997); Cialdini, Robert B., Altruism as hedonism: A social development perspective on the relationship of negative mood state and helping, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, 5, pp. 907-914, (1976); Cohen-Chen, Smadar, Feel Good or Do Good?

This study describes the types of livelihood adaptations (LAs) that coastal fishers in QN have practiced in response to EWEs and find the varieties in these adaptation strategy choices. In this study, we investigated livelihood adaptation strategies in coastal areas through a household survey and analysis of the collected data using MS Excel. Two sample strategies were used, stratified and random sampling, to select 229 coastal fishers from 11 communes; and data are collected through designed questionnaires. The current study employed statistical disaggregation and comparative methods to analyze coastal fishers’ adaptation strategy choices in QN Province. A range of adaptation strategies were identified consisting of five reactive LAs and eight anticipatory LAs practiced differently by coastal fishers. Among the eight anticipatory LAs, discontinuing production for a certain time is a novel adaptation in QN Province. In addition, a divergence in conducting LAs by production forms was found. On-sand farming and offshore fishers invest in advanced technologies and facilities as adaptive measures. By contrast, fishers who farm in estuaries, lagoons, and nearshore fishing fishers are more likely to change and diversify their jobs. The study’s key findings about livelihood adaptation measures and their differences are significant for improving coastal fisher’s livelihoods in Vietnam. Any efforts at local and national levels in developing mitigation strategies for the impact of EWEs may consider the coastal fisher’s adaptation choices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through the Project for Human Resources Development Scholarship by the Japanese Grant Aid (JDS).

Unlike many smart technologies, emotion-recognition systems sense, monitor, harvest and analyze data extracted from a person’s non-conscious or psycho-physical state, often without their knowledge or consent. As a far more invasive manner of surveillance capitalism, the technological adoption of emotional AI is problematized by a myriad of legal, ethical, cultural, and scientific issues. To better understand the behavioral factors determining an individual’s attitude towards this emerging technology, we first identify five major tensions that may impinge on adoption. Second, we extend the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) model with insights from the mindsponge model of information filtering (Vuong and Napier, 2015) along with quantitative affordances offered by the Bayesian computational approach. Our analysis was conducted based on a multi-national dataset surveying perceptions of 1015 young adults (age 18–27) regarding emotional AI applications and their socio-cultural characteristics such as income, region, religiosity, and home country politics. These characteristics are fed into our Bayesian multi-level models as varying intercepts so that we can systematically measure and compare the effects of various behavioral determinants on the attitudes of respondents towards non-conscious data harvesting by government and private sector actors. Critically, this study finds respondents who feel more familiar with, and perceive more utilities in AI technologies, as well as rate themselves as more restrained from heated arguments on social media, feel less threatened by the practice of non-conscious data harvesting by both government and private sector actors. Our findings offer a fertile platform for further exploration of the intersection between psychology, culture, and emotion-recognition technologies as well as important insights for policymakers wishing to ensure design and regulation of the technology serve the best interests of society. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study is part of the project \u201CEmotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life \u201D funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019) (https://www.jst.go.jp/ristex/hite/en/topics/409.html), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6.

The research addresses key questions regarding the speed of Asian states’ involvement in multilateral treaties and their adaptation to these treaties within the United Nations system over time. The approach combines empirical data and conceptualization to ensure a robust evidentiary basis. A dataset comprising 600 major multilateral treaties deposited in the United Nations system, covering diverse global issues, was collected. Additionally, ratification actions from twenty-eight Asian countries were categorized into four sub-regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia. To quantitatively measure states’ engagement with multilateral treaties, the study developed and calculated the Treaty Participation Index for each Asian country and sub-group. In an area predominantly characterized by qualitative research, this paper contributes to the existing literature by providing quantitative and metric findings for comparative analyses of multilateral treaty participation among the four Asian sub-regions, as well as comparisons between Asia and the rest of the world. By analyzing the results, the paper offers an evidence-based assessment of the feasibility of these four regionalisms in Asia, particularly in the context of the transition from international politics to the paradigm of global politics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 506.01-2019.301.","Conventions Treaties and Other Responses to Global Issues in Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems Eolss Developed Under the Auspices of the Unesco, (2004); Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira, Minority game with local interactions due to the presence of herding behavior, Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics, 355, 4-5, pp. 280-284, (2006); Denemark, Robert A., Just scraps of paper?: The dynamics of multilateral treaty-making, Cooperation and Conflict, 43, 2, pp. 185-219, (2008); Frederick, Shane W., Time discounting and time preference: A critical review, Journal of Economic Literature, 40, 2, pp. 351-401, (2002); Glas, Aarie, Understanding Multilateral Treaty-Making as Constitutive Practice, Journal of Global Security Studies, 3, 3, pp. 339-357, (2018); Opendemocracy, (2017); Jia Sipa, (2020); Foreign Affairs, (2002); Development of Global Legislative Politics Rousseau and Locke Writ Global, (2019); undefined, (2023)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164140668"

Parenting is embedded in cultural values, and previous research has shown the role of individualism in PB. In this paper, we reanalyze previously collected data to identify profiles based on the four dimensions of PB, and explore whether these profiles vary across countries’ levels of collectivistic-individualistic (COL-IND) values. Our sample comprised 16,885 individuals from 36 countries (73% women; 27% men), and we used a latent profile approach to uncover PB profiles. The findings showed five profiles: Fulfilled, Not in PB, Low risk of PB, High risk of PB and Burned out. The profiles pointed to climbing levels of PB in the total sample and in each of the three country groups (High COL/Low IND, Medium COL-IND, Low COL/High IND). Exploratory analyses revealed that distinct dimensions of PB had the most prominent roles in the climbing pattern, depending on the countries’ levels of COL/IND. In particular, we found contrast to be a hallmark dimension and an indicator of severe burnout for individualistic countries. Contrary to our predictions, emotional distance and saturation did not allow a clear differentiation across collectivistic countries. Our findings support several research avenues regarding PB measurement and intervention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collectivism; Cultural Values; Individualism; Latent Profile Analyses; Parental Burnout; Adult; Article; Burnout; Climbing; Controlled Study; Cultural Value; Exploratory Research; Female; Human; Human Tissue; Individuality; Major Clinical Study; Male; Prediction","adult; article; burnout; climbing; controlled study; cultural value; exploratory research; female; human; human tissue; individuality; major clinical study; male; prediction","","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under grant FCTUIDB/00050/2020.","Aguiar, Joyce, Parental Burnout and the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Portuguese Parents Experienced Lockdown Measures, Family Relations, 70, 4, pp. 927-938, (2021); Eryılmaz, Günce Sabah, Validation of the Turkish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 15-32, (2020); Aunola, Kaisa, Validity of the Finnish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 61, 5, pp. 714-722, (2020); Bornstein, Marc H., Cultural Approaches to Parenting, Parenting, 12, 2-3, pp. 212-221, (2012); Celeux, Gilles, An entropy criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model, Journal of Classification, 13, 2, pp. 195-212, (1996); Cheng, Huabin, Validation of a Chinese Version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, Frontiers in Psychology, 11, (2020); Furutani, Kaichiro, Exhausted parents in Japan: Preliminary validation of the Japanese version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 33-49, (2020); Gannagé, Myrna, Parental burnout in Lebanon: Validation psychometric properties of the Lebanese Arabic version of the Parental Burnout Assessment, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 51-65, (2020); Hamvai, Csaba, Parental Burnout in Hungary: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Hungarian Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA-HUN), European Journal of Mental Health, 17, 1, pp. 47-61, (2022); Hansotte, Logan, Are all Burned Out Parents Neglectful and Violent?

However, research has typically examined only a small number of predictors in one, or a small number of, national contexts. Such approaches make it difficult to examine the relative importance of predictors, and risk overlooking some potentially relevant variables altogether. To overcome this limitation, the present study used machine learning to rank-order the importance of 115 individual- and country-level variables in predicting conspiracy theorizing. Data were collected from 56,072 respondents across 28 countries during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Echoing previous findings, important predictors at the individual level included societal discontent, paranoia, and personal struggle. Contrary to prior research, important country-level predictors included indicators of political stability and effective government COVID response, which suggests that conspiracy theorizing may thrive in relatively well-functioning democracies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conspiracy Theories; Country-level Variables; Covid-19; Individual-level Variables; Machine Learning","","","","Funding text 1: The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research included in this article: New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75-71015), University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund).

Conversely, evolutionary and self-construal theorists suggest that gender gaps in agency and communion should be larger in more egalitarian countries, reflecting the greater autonomy support and flexible self-construction processes present in these countries. Using data from 62 countries (N = 28,640), we examine binary gender gaps in agentic and communal self-views as a function of country-level objective gender equality (the Global Gender Gap Index) and subjective distributions of social power (the Power Distance Index). Findings show that in more egalitarian countries, gender gaps in agency are smaller and gender gaps in communality are larger. These patterns are driven primarily by cross-country differences in men’s self-views and by the Power Distance Index (PDI) more robustly than the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI).

This paper designs a new fusion method of improved decision-directed acyclic graph (IDDAG) based on the principle of maximizing generalization ability and integrates it with the one-versus-one (OVO) decomposition method (OVO-IDDAG) to build MFDP models. Based on data of Chinese listed companies, we categorize corporate financial status into four states (financial soundness, financial pseudosoundness, moderate financial distress, and serious financial distress) and compare the MFDP performance of OVO-IDDAG with two benchmark methods, that is, the OVO decomposition method integrated with the max-win fusion method (OVO- max-win) and the OVO decomposition method integrated with the original DDAG fusion method (OVO-ODDAG). The experimental results show that the OVO-IDDAG method overall outperformances the benchmark methods. Among the six base classifiers of multivariate discriminant analysis, Logit, naive bayes, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest and the three imbalance processing mechanisms of random oversampling, random undersampling, and synthetic minority oversampling technique, the combination of the random forest classifier with the imbalance processing mechanism of random undersampling or the support vector machine classifier with the imbalance processing mechanism of random oversampling or synthetic minority oversampling technique is more suitable for MFDP based on OVO-IDDAG.

Journal of Research in Personality, 37(1), 48–75, 2003) were collected from individuals (N = 8361) in 28 countries encompassing 21 different languages. The purpose of this global collaboration was to examine both differences and similarities of humor styles across nations at the descriptive level. Across the countries, typically the highest scores were for the affiliative humor style. When each humor style was examined, some country samples demonstrated differences in mean scores. For example, the samples from Hungary, Indonesia, South Africa, and Serbia had high self-enhancing scores and Japan scored the lowest. In contrast to mean differences, almost all of the countries demonstrated positive inter-scale correlations, similar sex differences, and similar correlations with age, suggesting more similarities than differences. As discussed, some of the samples had low internal consistency values and poorly fitting factor structures for the humor style scales, suggesting that those results should be interpreted with caution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adults; Cross Culture; Humor Styles","","","","Funding text 1: Henrietta Bolló, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary: ÚNKP-17-3 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities.

It also examined the factors associated with students’ speaking skills, their motives for studying Japanese, and their needs for communication with native Japanese speakers while proposing a hypothetical model linking these constructs. A total of 108 students participated in the cross-sectional online survey questionnaire, which included questions on personal information, perceived Japanese language skills, motives for studying Japanese, needs for communication with native Japanese speakers, and self-esteem. The data were analyzed using SPSS. The results showed that the respondents perceived their Japanese speaking skills level as lower than the other three skills. Factors such as age, year of enrollment, years studying Japanese, English level, co-living status, study abroad experience, and self-esteem were found to be associated with the perceived speaking skills of the respondents. Family-related factors, such as parents’ education and the family’s study abroad experience, were also found to be associated with perceived speaking skills. The study also validated three constructs of motives for studying Japanese, including being interested in Japan, being interested in communication, and being interested in going to Japan and highlighting the respondents’ needs for communication with native speakers. The proposed model suggests that motives for studying Japanese influence perceived speaking skills and the need for communication with native Japanese speakers. The findings of this study have implications for Japanese language education, particularly in the development of teaching strategies that enhance students’ speaking skills and provide opportunities for communication with native speakers.

Boredom, specifically, has been singled out as one potential risk factor for noncompliance. We examined whether there was empirical evidence to support this concern during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large cross-national sample of 63,336 community respondents from 116 countries. Although boredom was higher in countries with more COVID-19 cases and in countries that instituted more stringent lockdowns, such boredom did not predict longitudinal within-person decreases in social distancing behavior (or vice versa; n = 8,031) in early spring and summer of 2020. Overall, we found little evidence that changes in boredom predict individual public health behaviors (handwashing, staying home, self-quarantining, and avoiding crowds) over time, or that such behaviors had any reliable longitudinal effects on boredom itself. In summary, contrary to concerns, we found little evidence that boredom posed a public health risk during lockdown and quarantine. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Emotion; Public Health; Self-regulation; Simpson’s Paradox; Adult; Article; Boredom; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Fatigue; Hand Washing; Health Behavior; Health Hazard; High Risk Behavior; Home Quarantine; Human; Infection Prevention; National Lockdown; Pandemic; Population Density; Psychological Well-being; Public Health; Social Distancing; Spring; Summer","adult; Article; boredom; coronavirus disease 2019; fatigue; hand washing; health behavior; health hazard; high risk behavior; home quarantine; human; infection prevention; national lockdown; pandemic; population density; psychological well-being; public health; social distancing; spring; summer","","","This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75-71015), the University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (COV20/00086).

Therefore, we herein investigated the relationships among depression, body mass index (BMI), and CP in community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly individuals. Participants comprised 2216 inhabitants of Shika town in Ishikawa prefecture, Japan, including 1003 males (mean age of 68.72 years, standard deviation (SD) of 8.36) and 1213 females (mean age of 69.65 years, SD of 9.36). CP and DS were assessed using a CP questionnaire and Geriatric Depression Scale-15, respectively. The Breslow–Day test indicated that DS positively correlated with lumbar/knee pain in the BMI < 25 group, but not in the BMI ≥ 25 group. Furthermore, lumber/knee pain was related to a higher BMI. These results were confirmed by a logistic analysis with age, sex, BMI, solitary living, the duration of education, no exercise/hobbies, smoking history, alcohol intake, and medical treatment for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension as confounding factors. The present study indicates the importance of considering DS and BMI in the prevention of CP.

We designed this study to examine the prospective relationship between autistic traits in children and subsequent nutrient intake in later childhood and whether this relationship changes over time. We utilized longitudinal data obtained at two time points from the Shika study, an ongoing population-based study conducted in a rural area of Japan. Participants were 759 Japanese children aged between 7 and 12 years at baseline and between 10 and 15 years in the follow-up. The results obtained showed relatively lower intakes of sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, vitamin D, vitamin B2, and vitamin B12 among children with than without autistic traits. Interactions were observed among autistic traits and time points for iron, vitamin B2, folic acid, and pantothenic acid. The results of this study suggest the importance of screening the nutrient intake of children with autistic traits across childhood in order to reduce the risk of restricted intake. Lay Abstract: It is known about food selectivity among children with autism spectrum disorder. However, the nutritional inadequacy among children with ASD is not clear. Especially, long-term evaluation has not been studied. We examined the prospective relationship between autistic traits in children and subsequent nutrient intake in later childhood. We utilized data obtained at two time points from a study conducted in Japan. Participants were 759 Japanese children aged between 7 and 12 years at baseline and between 10 and 15 years in the follow-up. The results showed relatively lower intakes of sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, vitamin D, vitamin B2, and vitamin B12 among children with than without autistic traits. Relatively lower intake of minerals and vitamins in children with autistic traits is more evident in later childhood. The results suggest the importance of screening the nutrient intake of children with autistic traits across childhood. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asd; Children; Longitudinal; Nutrient; Population-based; Calcium; Cyanocobalamin; Folic Acid; Iron; Pantothenic Acid; Riboflavin; Sodium; Thiamine; Vitamins; Calcium; Cyanocobalamin; Folic Acid; Iron; Pantothenic Acid; Riboflavin; Sodium; Thiamine; Vitamin D; Vitamin; Adolescent; Article; Autism; Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire; Brief Type Self Administered Diet History Questionnaire; Caloric Intake; Child; Compulsion; Diet Supplementation; Dietary History Questionnaire; Dietary Intake; Female; Food Frequency Questionnaire; Food Intake; Human; Interrater Reliability; Japanese (people); Likert Scale; Longitudinal Study; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nutrient Intake; Nutritional Assessment; Obesity; Phenotype; Prospective Study; Protein Intake; Scoring System; Sensitivity And Specificity; Social Interaction; Sodium Intake; Test Retest Reliability; Underweight; Vitamin Intake; Eating; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; East Asian People; Eating; Humans; Prospective Studies; Vitamins","calcium; cyanocobalamin; folic acid; iron; pantothenic acid; riboflavin; sodium; thiamine; vitamin D; vitamin; adolescent; Article; autism; Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire; Brief type self administered Diet History Questionnaire; caloric intake; child; compulsion; diet supplementation; Dietary History Questionnaire; dietary intake; female; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; human; interrater reliability; Japanese (people); Likert scale; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nutrient intake; nutritional assessment; obesity; phenotype; prospective study; protein intake; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; social interaction; sodium intake; test retest reliability; underweight; vitamin intake; eating; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; East Asian People; Eating; Humans; Prospective Studies; Vitamins","","calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; cyanocobalamin, 53570-76-6, 68-19-9, 8064-09-3; folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; pantothenic acid, 20938-62-9, 79-83-4, 867-81-2; riboflavin, 83-88-5; sodium, 7440-23-5; thiamine, 59-43-8, 67-03-8; Vitamins","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge funding from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan, grant number: 20K18959 (H.T.).","Al-Farsi, Yahya Mohammed, Low folate and vitamin B12 nourishment is common in Omani children with newly diagnosed autism, Nutrition, 29, 3, pp. 537-541, (2013); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (1994); Bandini, Linda G., Food selectivity in children with autism spectrum disorders and typically developing children, Journal of Pediatrics, 157, 2, pp. 259-264, (2010); Bandini, Linda G., Changes in Food Selectivity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 47, 2, pp. 439-446, (2017); Ben-Sasson, Ayelet, A meta-analysis of sensory modulation symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 39, 1, pp. 1-11, (2009); Data Statistics on Autism Spectrum Disorder, (2020); Cermak, Sharon A., Food Selectivity and Sensory Sensitivity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 110, 2, pp. 238-246, (2010); Chistol, Liem T., Sensory Sensitivity and Food Selectivity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 48, 2, pp. 583-591, (2018); Cornish, E., Gluten and casein free diets in autism: A study of the effects on food choice and nutrition, Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, 15, 4, pp. 261-269, (2002); Croen, Lisa A., The health status of adults on the autism spectrum, Autism, 19, 7, pp. 814-823, (2015)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","13623613; 14617005","","AUTIF","35652325","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131551393"

This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with the adoption of recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours, and potential determinants of trust in government during the pandemic. Methods This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23 countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys. Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. Results Higher trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve analyses (median standardised β = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001). Government perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised β = 0.358, 0.230, 0.056, and 0.249, p < 0.01). Higher trust at baseline survey was significantly associated with lower rate of decline in health behaviours over time (p for interaction = 0.001). Conclusions These results highlighted the importance of trust in government in the control of COVID-19. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Altruism; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Government; Health Behavior; Human; Longitudinal Study; Pandemic; Questionnaire; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Trust; Altruism; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Government; Health Behavior; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Sars-cov-2; Surveys And Questionnaires; Trust","altruism; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; government; health behavior; human; longitudinal study; pandemic; questionnaire; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trust; Altruism; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Government; Health Behavior; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust","","","","Alsan, Marcella M., Tuskegee and the health of black men, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 133, 1, pp. 407-455, (2018); Anderson, Roy Malcolm, How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?, The Lancet, 395, 10228, pp. 931-934, (2020); Bargain, Olivier B., Trust and compliance to public health policies in times of COVID-19, Journal of Public Economics, 192, (2020); Bingenheimer, Jeffrey Bart, Statistical and substantive inferences in public health: Issues in the application of multilevel models, Annual Review of Public Health, 25, pp. 53-77, (2004); Blair, Robert A., Public health and public trust: Survey evidence from the Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in Liberia, Social Science and Medicine, 172, pp. 89-97, (2017); Bouckaert, Geert, Comparing measures of citizen trust and user satisfaction as indicators of 'good governance': Difficulties in linking trust and satisfaction indicators, International Review of Administrative Sciences, 69, 3, pp. 329-343, (2003); Chanley, Virginia A., The origins and consequences of public trust in government: A time series analysis, Public Opinion Quarterly, 64, 3, pp. 239-256, (2000); Public Performance Management Review, (2005); Devine, Daniel J., Trust and the Coronavirus Pandemic: What are the Consequences of and for Trust?

However, these models lack a mechanism that can incorporate syntactic tendencies. Thus, attention-based neural networks are less accurate when dealing with complex syntactic relationships and long-span syntactically dependent utterances. To solve this problem, a neural network model combining a conditional random field and a graph convolutional network is proposed. The model uses a conditional random field chain to extract the opinion span of an aspect-specific word, integrates the contextual information within the opinion span to the global nodes through a multilayer graph convolutional network using the improved position decay function, and predicts the aspect-specific sentiment polarity labels by computing the vector expressions of the global nodes. This study addresses the problem of fluctuations in model accuracy when multiple aspect words exist in an utterance by introducing global nodes into a graph convolutional network. The proposed model performed well in the experiments on all four datasets tested. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis; Crf; Decay Function; Gcn; Natural Language Processing; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Graph Theory; Random Processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Aspect-level Sentiment Analyse; Convolutional Networks; Crf; Decay Function; Gcn; Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Random Fields; Sentiment Analysis","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Graph theory; Random processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Aspect-level sentiment analyse; Convolutional networks; CRF; Decay function; GCN; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Random fields; Sentiment analysis","","","This work was sponsored by the Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 - Major Project of New Generation Artificial Intelligence, China (No. 2020AAA0109300 ), Shanghai Science and Technology Young Talents Sailing Program, China (No. 19YF1418400 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62006150 ), Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan, China ( 22S31903700 , 21S31904200 ), Songjiang District Science and Technology Research Project, China (No. 19SJKJGG83 ), \u201CScience and Technology Innovation Action Plan\u201D of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission for Social Development Project, China (No. 21DZ1204900 ), and the Shanghai Local Capacity Enhancement Project, China (No. 21010501500 ).","Cambria, Erik, Affective Computing and Sentiment Analysis, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 31, 2, pp. 102-107, (2016); Majumder, Navonil, Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification with Multitask Learning, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 34, 3, pp. 38-43, (2019); Zheng, Lijuan, Sentimental feature selection for sentiment analysis of chinese online reviews, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 9, 1, pp. 75-84, (2018); Bahdanau, Dzmitry, Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, (2015); Tang, Duyu, Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network, pp. 214-224, (2016); Interactive Attention Networks for Aspect Level Sentiment Classification, (2017); Kipf, Thomas N., Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks, (2017); Zhang, Chen, Aspect-based sentiment classification with aspect-specific graph convolutional networks, pp. 4568-4578, (2019); Xu, Lu, Aspect sentiment classification with aspect-specific opinion spans, pp. 3561-3567, (2020); Icml, (2001)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144051390"

This study examined the understanding of Quality Physical Education (QPE) from the perspective of PE professionals primarily entrusted with implementing initiatives to develop QPE. A total of 2,191 individuals from 25 Asian cities participated in this study. They completed a validated QPE questionnaire consisting of 49 items distributed into eight dimensions. The variables of gender, work position, and years of experience were investigated in accounting for the differences in perceptions. The overall mean value for QPE was 7.32, with excellent internal consistency (a= .986). The results indicated similar trends in the perceptions of the QPE and evaluation of the items by professionals. No significant differences between genders and across work positions were found. However, significant differences were found among perceptions depending on the years of experience in teaching PE. Moreover, findings revealed the need for governmental support for research in PE and collaborative work at the international and national levels. This study contributes to the groundwork of policy analyses and strategic development in improving QPE in Asia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Pe Professionals; Physical Education; Quality Physical Education","","","","","International Journal of Sports Science, (2014); Alfrey, Laura, Physical education teachers' continuing professional development in health-related exercise, Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy, 17, 5, pp. 477-491, (2012); Alfrey, Laura, Physical education teachers' continuing professional development in health-related exercise: A figurational analysis, European Physical Education Review, 18, 3, pp. 361-379, (2012); Cheung, Peggy Pui Yee, School-based physical activity opportunities in PE lessons and after-school hours: Are they associated with children’s daily physical activity?, European Physical Education Review, 25, 1, pp. 65-75, (2019); White Paper on Establishing National Curriculum Standards for Sports Education in India Cii India, (2017); Cooper, Kenneth H., Implementing Policies to Enhance Physical Education and Physical Activity in Schools, Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport, 87, 2, pp. 133-140, (2016); Learning to Learn the Way Forward in Curriculum Development Consultation Document Hksar Curriculum Development Council, (2000); Des Encuentros, (2014); Educere, (2018); Dudley, Dean Alan, What effect on learning does increasing the proportion of curriculum time allocated to physical education have?

Theoretical framework: The study considers institutions from the perspective of governance institutions. Accordingly, the concept of government institutions is related to the country's organizational foundation in terms of governance, implying institutional quality. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses GMM method and also choose the Zscore as the primary variable for bank stability. Findings: The results show that institutional quality increases the stability of banks. Moreover, with the threshold model, the results show that countries with institutional quality above the threshold will increase the stability of banks. In addition, macroeconomic and banking characteristics variables such as total assets, income diversification, quality of control, inflation, and GDP growth rate have a high significance in the model. Research, Practical & Social implications: The study shows The study's empirical results have specific policy implications for the Government in implementing policies related to institutional quality to improve bank stability. Originality/value: there are not many researches done to investigate institutional quality to improve bank stability. Moreover, from economic crisis, the matter of banking stability is among main concerns of many researches. Second, previous researches just focus on the aspect of corruption and ignore other aspects or other factors.

Horizontal and vertical aspects of individualism and collectivism had small but significant contributions to predicting loneliness. Horizontal-collectivism (for 19 country samples) and, to a lesser extent, horizontal-individualism (for seven country samples), significantly predicted lower loneliness scores. Vertical-individualism (for 16 country samples), and to a lesser extent, vertical-collectivism (for six country samples), predicted feeling more loneliness among our participants. Adjusted R2 values suggested that between 0.6% and 27.7% of self-report loneliness was predicted. These results suggest that those who value egalitarian social relations also tend to report being less lonely whereas those who value individuality and competitiveness endorse the loneliness items more. These results are of importance to those investigating and helping lonely individuals by appreciating the influence of perceived culture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collectivism; Horizontalism-verticalism; Individualism; Loneliness","","","","","Allik, Jüri, Individualism-collectivism and social capital, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35, 1, pp. 29-49, (2004); Asparouhov, Tihomir, Multiple-Group Factor Analysis Alignment, Structural Equation Modeling, 21, 4, pp. 495-508, (2014); Barreto, Manuela, Loneliness around the world: Age, gender, and cultural differences in loneliness, Personality and Individual Differences, 169, (2021); Burton, Leslie A., Individualism/collectivism and personality in Italian and American Groups, Current Psychology, 40, 1, pp. 29-34, (2021); Cacioppo, John T., The phenotype of loneliness, European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 9, 4, pp. 446-452, (2012); Chen, Xinguang (Jim), Constructs, concept mapping, and psychometric assessment of the concise scale of individualism–collectivism, Social Behavior and Personality, 43, 4, pp. 667-684, (2015); Cheung, Gordon Wai Hung, Evaluating goodness-of-fit indexes for testing measurement invariance, Structural Equation Modeling, 9, 2, pp. 233-255, (2002); Chopik, William J., Differences in Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking Across 63 Countries, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 48, 1, pp. 23-38, (2017); Diener, Edward F., National differences in reported subjective well-being: Why do they occur?, Social Indicators Research, 34, 1, pp. 7-32, (1995); Social Cohesion in the Western World What Holds Societies Together Insights from the Social Cohesion Radar, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26665182","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150823078"

Does the answer differ across countries and social classes? To answer these questions in a way that minimizes bias and ethnocentrism, we used open-ended questions to explore ideal-parent beliefs among 8,357 mothers and 3,517 fathers from 37 countries. Leximancer Semantic Network Analysis was utilized to first determine parenting culture zones (i.e., countries with shared ideal-parent beliefs) and then extract the predominant themes and concepts in each culture zone. The results yielded specific types of ideal-parent beliefs in five parenting culture zones: being “responsible and children/family-focused” for Asian parents, being “responsible and proper demeanor-focused” for African parents, and being “loving and responsible” for Hispanic-Italian parents. Although the most important themes and concepts were the same in the final two zones—being “loving and patient,” there were subtle differences: English-speaking, European Union, and Russian parents emphasized “being caring,” while French-speaking parents valued “listening” or being “present.” Ideal-parent beliefs also differed by education levels within culture zones, but no general pattern was discerned across culture zones. These findings suggest that the country in which parents were born cannot fully explain their differences in ideal-parent beliefs and that differences arising from social class or education level cannot be dismissed. Future research should consider how these differences affect the validity of the measurements in question and how they can be incorporated into parenting intervention research within and across cultures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Content Analysis; Parental Beliefs; Positive Parenting; Qualitative And Quantitative Methods; Semantic Network Analysis; African; Article; Asian; Care Behavior; Child; Child Parent Relation; Content Analysis; Education; Educational Status; European Union; Father; Female; Hispanic; Human; Italian (citizen); Male; Mother; Network Analysis; Quantitative Analysis; Russian (citizen); Social Class; Speech; Validity","African; article; Asian; care behavior; child; child parent relation; content analysis; education; educational status; European Union; father; female; Hispanic; human; Italian (citizen); male; mother; network analysis; quantitative analysis; Russian (citizen); social class; speech; validity","","","Funding text 1: The authors thank the International Investigation of Parental Burnout (IIPB) Consortium (https://www.burnoutparental.com/international-consortium) for collecting and providing the data on which this study is based.

In particular, the global numbers of mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68% from 1970 to 2016. One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably, perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast, perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government’s and international organizations’ funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We would like to send our gratitude to our colleagues, family, and friends for supporting us during the research, especially Prof. Vuong Quan Hoang (Phenikaa University).

However, understanding of service quality and satisfaction relations has been limited. This study seeks an appropriate method to demonstrate the nature of service quality-satisfaction relations. Thereby, research results can be methodologically, theoretically, and empirically defensible. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) and the three-factor theory, the most widely preferred for public transport service quality prioritization based on the importance of service factors to rider satisfaction, will be utilized. The study takes transit service in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, to demonstrate that the three-factor theory, which has been limitedly utilized despite being more advantageous and robust, is superior to the IPA. Although the extent to which the service quality factors affect satisfaction varied across rider segments, the types of service quality factors were found consistent. For example, captive riders considered all service factors as performance. Non-captive riders considered the environment factor as excitement. No basic factor was found across rider groups. This study contributes to the limited understanding of the non-linear and asymmetric relations between service quality and satisfaction of various rider groups, which is rarely found in transit service quality literature. Furthermore, it introduced a case study of Vietnamese urban transit services for the first time. It suggests that enhancing passenger information, rider care, and comfort are recommended as the most practical and economical measures in the short run. However, the city government should improve availability and accessibility to promote public transport ridership in the long run. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Importance-performance Analysis; Public Transport; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segments; Service Quality; Three-factor Theory; Factor Analysis; Quality Control; Importance-performance Analysis; Prioritization; Public Transport; Public Transport Service; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segment; Service Quality; Service Satisfaction; Three-factor Theory; Transit Services; Quality Of Service; Performance Assessment; Prioritization; Public Transport; Service Quality; Strategic Approach; Viet Nam","Factor analysis; Quality control; Importance-performance analysis; Prioritization; Public transport; Public transport service; Rider satisfaction; Rider segment; Service Quality; Service satisfaction; Three-factor theory; Transit services; Quality of service; performance assessment; prioritization; public transport; service quality; strategic approach; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the World Bank for the data.

It reviews the idea of “nature” in Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Tagalog, Cebuano, Lumad, Indonesian, Burmese, Nepali, Khmer, and Mongolian. It shows that the conceptual subtleties in the conceptualization of nature often hide wider and deeper cosmological mismatches. It concludes by suggesting that these diverse voices need to be represented in global reports on sustainability, which can be fostered by the direct involvement of experts from diverse traditions of thought who have access and interpretative knowledge of sources in languages other than English. To take into consideration the diversity of conceptualizations of nature can lead to better decisions about sustainability and improve the acceptability and efficiency of environmental policies in each local context, as well as internationally.

Because loneliness has been suggested to be both commonly experienced and detrimental, we examine if there are similar patterns between humor styles, gender, and age with loneliness in samples of individuals from diverse backgrounds. Across the country samples, affiliative and self-enhancing humor styles negatively correlated with loneliness, self-defeating was positively correlated, and the aggressive humor style was not significantly related. In predicting loneliness, 40.5% of the variance could be accounted. Younger females with lower affiliative, lower self-enhancing, and higher self-defeating humor style scores had higher loneliness scores. The results suggest that although national mean differences may be present, the pattern of relationships between humor styles and loneliness is consistent across these diverse samples, providing some suggestions for mental health promotion among lonely individuals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Gender; Human; Humor Styles; Loneliness","","","","","Barreto, Manuela, Loneliness around the world: Age, gender, and cultural differences in loneliness, Personality and Individual Differences, 169, (2021); Baumeister, Roy F., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 117, 3, pp. 497-529, (1995); Bollen, Kenneth Alan, Three Cs in Measurement Models: Causal Indicators, Composite Indicators, and Covariates, Psychological Methods, 16, 3, pp. 265-284, (2011); Cacioppo, Stephanie, Loneliness: Clinical Import and Interventions, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 10, 2, pp. 238-249, (2015); Çeçen-Eroǧul, Ayşe Rezan, Humor styles in predicting loneliness among Turkish University students, Social Behavior and Personality, 35, 6, pp. 835-844, (2007); Distel, Marijn A., Familial resemblance for loneliness, Behavior Genetics, 40, 4, pp. 480-494, (2010); Dykstra, Pearl A., Older adult loneliness: Myths and realities, European Journal of Ageing, 6, 2, pp. 91-100, (2009); Eder, Anselm, Risk factor loneliness.

Therefore, this epidemiological study examined the role of body weight in the relationship between hypertension and depressive symptoms among the middle-aged and elderly living in the community of Shika town. In total, 1141 males and 1142 females with mean ages of 69.09 and 70.61 years, respectively, participated this study. Physiological factors, including blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle, were investigated in a medical check-up in Shika town. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale 15 (GDS-15). A two-way analysis of covariance exhibited a significant interaction between the two hypertensive groups and body size groups on GDS in females. The post hoc Bonferroni method showed that in the hypertensive groups, GDS was significantly higher in the underweight group (BMI < 18.5) than in the standard/overweight group; however, this relationship was not observed in the no-hypertensive groups. Multiple regression analysis also verified this relationship. Therefore, it is suggested that the combination of hypertension and being underweight is associated with depressive symptoms only in females. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Cross-sectional Study; Geriatric Depression Scale; Multiple Regression Analysis","","","","This study was funded by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific and Technology-Japan (Research project/Area number: 19H03882).","Terlizzi, Emily P., Mental Health Treatment Among Adults: United States, 2019, National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, 380, pp. 1-8, (2020); Zhang, Melvyn W.B., Prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression, General Hospital Psychiatry, 33, 3, pp. 217-223, (2011); Lu, Yanxia, Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents with asthma: A meta-analysis and meta-regression, Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, 23, 8, pp. 707-715, (2012); Ho, Chun Man Roger, Clinical and psychosocial factors associated with depression and anxiety in Singaporean patients with rheumatoid arthritis, International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 14, 1, pp. 37-47, (2011); Rantanen, Ansa Talvikki, Awareness of hypertension and depressive symptoms: a cross-sectional study in a primary care population, Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care, 36, 3, pp. 323-328, (2018); Ma, Chunhua, The prevalence of depressive symptoms and associated factors in countryside-dwelling older Chinese patients with hypertension, Journal of Clinical Nursing, 27, 15-16, pp. 2933-2941, (2018); Bergantin, Leandro Bueno, Depression rises the risk of hypertension incidence: discussing the link through the Ca2+/cAMP signalling, Current Hypertension Reviews, 16, 1, pp. 73-78, (2020); Li, Zhanzhan, Prevalence of depression in patients with hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Medicine (United States), 94, 31, (2015); Scalco, Andréia Zavaloni, Hypertension and depression., Clinics, 60, 3, pp. 241-250, (2005); Kim, Jinseok, Body mass index and depressive symptoms in older adults: A cross-lagged panel analysis, PLOS ONE, 9, 12, (2014)","","MDPI","","","","","","2076328X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141807128"

This raises questions about how to interpret what such youths report. Rescorla et al. (2019, European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 28, 1107) found that much more variance in 72,493 parents’ ratings of their offspring’s mental health problems was accounted for by individual differences than by societal or cultural differences. Although parents’ reports are essential for clinical assessment of their offspring, they reflect parents’ perceptions of the offspring. Consequently, clinical assessment also requires self-reports from the offspring themselves. To test effects of individual differences, society, and culture on youths’ self-ratings of their problems and strengths, we analyzed Youth Self-Report (YSR) scores for 39,849 11–17 year olds in 38 societies. Methods: Indigenous researchers obtained YSR self-ratings from population samples of youths in 38 societies representing 10 culture cluster identified in the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavioral Effectiveness study. Hierarchical linear modeling of scores on 17 problem scales and one strengths scale estimated the percent of variance accounted for by individual differences (including measurement error), society, and culture cluster. ANOVAs tested age and gender effects. Results: Averaged across the 17 problem scales, individual differences accounted for 92.5% of variance, societal differences 6.0%, and cultural differences 1.5%. For strengths, individual differences accounted for 83.4% of variance, societal differences 10.1%, and cultural differences 6.5%. Age and gender had very small effects. Conclusions: Like parents’ ratings, youths’ self-ratings of problems were affected much more by individual differences than societal/cultural differences. Most variance in self-rated strengths also reflected individual differences, but societal/cultural effects were larger than for problems, suggesting greater influence of social desirability. The clinical significance of individual differences in youths’ self-reports should thus not be minimized by societal/cultural differences, which—while important—can be taken into account with appropriate norms, as can gender and age differences. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Individual Differences; Multicultural; Psychopathology; Strengths; Youth Self-report; Adolescent; Child; Child Parent Relation; Human; Individuality; Psychology; Self Report; Adolescent; Child; Humans; Individuality; Parents; Self Report","adolescent; child; child parent relation; human; individuality; psychology; self report; Adolescent; Child; Humans; Individuality; Parents; Self Report","","","This article is dedicated to the memory of Leslie Altman Rescorla, who died on October 12, 2020, and on whose work our study is based.

Our study similarly showed that individual differences in youths’ self-ratings of their problems accounted for much more variance than societal or cultural differences. Societal and cultural differences accounted for somewhat more variance in youths’ self-ratings of strengths than problems, suggesting more influence of social desirability on self-ratings of favorable characteristics. The findings indicate that the clinical significance of individual differences in youths’ self-ratings should not be minimized by societal/cultural differences, which can be taken account of with appropriate norms.

The findings indicate that the clinical significance of individual differences in youths’ self-ratings should not be minimized by societal/cultural differences, which can be taken account of with appropriate norms.","Abad, Judit, Emotional and behavioral problems as measured by the YSR: Gender and age differences in Spanish adolescents, European Journal of Psychological Assessment, 18, 2, pp. 149-157, (2002); Dsm Oriented Guide for the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Aseba, (2013); Achenbach, Thomas M., International findings with the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA): Applications to clinical services, research, and training, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health, 13, 1, (2019); Achenbach, Thomas M., Epidemiological Comparisons of Puerto Rican and U.S. Mainland Children: Parent, Teacher, and Self-Reports, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 29, 1, pp. 84-93, (1990); Manual for the Aseba Preschool Forms and Profiles, (2001); Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, (2009); Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Begovac, Ivan, Comparison of self-reported and parent-reported emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents from Croatia, Collegium Antropologicum, 28, 1, pp. 393-401, (2004); Bilenberg, Niels, The child behavior checklist (CBCL) and related material: Standardization and validation in Danish population based and clinically based samples, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, Supplement, 100, 398, pp. 2-52, (1999); Broberg, Anders G., Self-reported competencies and problems among Swedish adolescents: A normative study of the YSR, European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 10, 3, pp. 186-193, (2001)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","14697610; 00219630","","JPPDA","35167140","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124593069"

The goal is to classify input data into one seen class or other unseen classes. This paper proposes an OCC approach using a signal transformation network (OCSTN), which aims to process univariate time-series data. The main contribution is developing a signal transformation network (STN) that aims to transform input signals into one signal, namely the goal signal. Moreover, the model error of the STN is a distance metric between the goal signal and the model output. The STN model learns from one-class signals. Therefore, model error for one class is small relative to other classes. Accordingly, OCSTN could discriminate between seen and unseen classes using the model errors. The proposed OCSTN is evaluated using two ballistocardiography (BCG) datasets. The OCSTN achieves fair results in both AUC scores and processing speed. OCSTN has a weak point in training diverse signals. In addition, the entropy and smoothness of the goal signal are highly related to the AUC score. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; One-class Classification; One-class Time-series Classification; Signal Transformation; Time-series Classification; Anomaly Detection; Classification (of Information); Errors; Time Series; Classification Approach; Classification Tasks; Model Errors; One-class Classification; One-class Time-series Classification; Signal Transformation; Time Series Classifications; Training Data; Metadata","Anomaly detection; Classification (of information); Errors; Time series; Classification approach; Classification tasks; Model errors; One-class Classification; One-class time-series classification; Signal transformation; Time series classifications; Training data; Metadata","","","Funding text 1: This publication was based on the information (data) provided by Program 4 within the research project designated (named) “Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment HAIE” with registration number CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000798, which was funded by the European Union and provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.

Firstly, GSCM has a positive and significant influence on the operational performance of businesses in Vietnam. Secondly, the resulting effect of implementing GSCM is better for enterprises with large scale and high export rates. This has reaffirmed the need to improve the overall supply chain management and green supply chain of this group of businesses.

Although important information about customers’ habits can be revealed by HAUIs, they can expose sensitive information. To address this concern, the problem of hiding frequent HAUIs (FHAUIs) is studied, which is to modify a transaction database to ensure that sensitive FHAUIs cannot be discovered. An algorithm is designed, named H-FHAUI, which relies on an extended border approach based on the support (occurrence frequency) and the average-utility of itemsets. Moreover, to hide all FHAUIs, H-FHAUI utilizes a novel extended lower border named Bd<inf>E</inf>- based on weak upper bounds on the average-utility to only hide a small number of FHAUIs. Then, all remaining FHAUIs are also hidden. Besides, H-FHAUI utilizes a novel weight-based strategy named ICS to choose items and transactions to be modified, a novel TIU-VIU structure to quickly update weak upper bounds, and a strategy named DUS<inf>WUB</inf> to quickly hide FHAUIs while ensuring that the total utility of D is preserved as much as possible.

This study explored the structure of psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia using network analysis in a large representative Asian sample based on a survey of clinical features and treatment used in schizophrenia patients across 15 countries/territories in Asia. Methods: Data on the demographic characteristics and psychiatric symptoms in schizophrenia patients were extracted from the dataset of the fourth Research on Asia Psychotropic Prescription for Antipsychotics (REAP-AP) project. The presence of the following psychiatric symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms, social/occupational dysfunction, verbal aggression, physical aggression, and affective symptoms were analyzed. Results: A total of 3681 patients were included. The network analysis revealed that verbal aggression, hallucinations, and social/occupational dysfunction were the most central symptoms, while the connections between social/occupational dysfunction and verbal aggression, and between hallucinations and disorganized speech were the two strongest edges. There were significant gender differences in the network structure based on the network structure invariance test (M=0.74, P = 0.03) and invariant edge strength test. The positive correlation between verbal aggression and hallucinations was significantly stronger in the female network than that in the male network (P = 0.03), while a negative correlation between affective symptoms and negative symptoms was found in the female, but not the male network (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Central symptoms including verbal aggression, hallucinations, and socio-occupational dysfunction should be addressed in developing targeted treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Network Analysis; Psychiatric Symptoms; Schizophrenia; Antipsychotic Agents; Psychotropic Drugs; Adult; Article; Asia; Catatonia; Clinical Feature; Controlled Study; Correlational Study; Cross-sectional Study; Delusion; Female; Hallucination; Health Survey; Human; Longitudinal Study; Major Clinical Study; Male; Negative Syndrome; Network Analysis; Occupational Disease; Schizophrenia; Social Disability; Verbal Hostility; Prescription; Neuroleptic Agent; Psychotropic Agent; Antipsychotic Agents; Female; Hallucinations; Humans; Male; Prescriptions; Psychotropic Drugs; Schizophrenia","adult; Article; Asia; catatonia; clinical feature; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; delusion; female; hallucination; health survey; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; negative syndrome; network analysis; occupational disease; schizophrenia; social disability; verbal hostility; prescription; neuroleptic agent; psychotropic agent; Antipsychotic Agents; Female; Hallucinations; Humans; Male; Prescriptions; Psychotropic Drugs; Schizophrenia","","Antipsychotic Agents; Psychotropic Drugs","The study was supported by the Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission (Grant No.: Z181100001718124 ), Beijing Talents Foundation (Grant No.: 2017000021469G222 ), and the University of Macau ( MYRG2019-00066-FHS ).","Alessandrini, Marine, A structural equation modelling approach to explore the determinants of quality of life in schizophrenia, Schizophrenia Research, 171, 1-3, pp. 27-34, (2016); Allen, Paul P., The hallucinating brain: A review of structural and functional neuroimaging studies of hallucinations, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 32, 1, pp. 175-191, (2008); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (2000); Ayesa-Arriola, Rosa, Suicidal behaviour in first-episode non-affective psychosis: Specific risk periods and stage-related factors, European Neuropsychopharmacology, 25, 12, pp. 2278-2288, (2015); Barlow, K., Prevalence and precipitants of aggression in psychiatric inpatient units, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 34, 6, pp. 967-974, (2000); Bauer, Susanne Monika, Culture and the prevalence of hallucinations in schizophrenia, Comprehensive Psychiatry, 52, 3, pp. 319-325, (2011); Borsboom, Denny, Network analysis: An integrative approach to the structure of psychopathology, Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 9, pp. 91-121, (2013); Bratlien, Unni, Social dysfunction in first-episode psychosis and relations to neurocognition, duration of untreated psychosis and clinical symptoms, Psychiatry Research, 207, 1-2, pp. 33-39, (2013); Bringmann, Laura F., A Network Approach to Psychopathology: New Insights into Clinical Longitudinal Data, PLOS ONE, 8, 4, (2013)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18762026; 18762018","","","35850062","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134595349"

This study reported the prevalence of traditional victimization, cybervictimization, and the combination of these, in 13 European and Asian countries, and explored how psychiatric symptoms were associated with victimization. The data for this cross-sectional, school-based study of 21,688 adolescents aged 13–15 were collected from 2011 to 2017. The main outcomes were traditional and cybervictimization obtained from student self-reports. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to assess psychiatric symptoms. Generalized estimating equation and logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The mean prevalence of any victimization was 28.9%, of traditional victimization only, this was 17.7%, and for cybervictimization only this was 5.1%. Cybervictimization occurred both independently, and in combination with, traditional victimization. The mean prevalence of combined victimization was 6.1%. The mean proportion of those who were cyberbullied only among those who were either cyberbullied only or bullied both traditionally and in cyber was 45.1%. The rates of prevalence varied widely between countries. In the total sample, those who experienced combined victimization, reported the highest internalizing symptoms (girls, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.22–1.29; boys, OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.25–1.33). The study findings suggest that anti-bullying interventions should include mental health components and target both traditional and cyberbullying. Due to the overlap between these, targeting bullying should primarily focus on how to reduce bullying behavior rather than just focusing on where bullying takes place. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent Psychiatry; Bullying; Cross-cultural; Cyberbullying; Victimization; Adolescent; Bullying; Crime Victim; Cross-sectional Study; Female; Human; Male; Psychology; School; Adolescent; Bullying; Crime Victims; Cross-sectional Studies; Cyberbullying; Female; Humans; Male; Schools","adolescent; bullying; crime victim; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; psychology; school; Adolescent; Bullying; Crime Victims; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cyberbullying; Female; Humans; Male; Schools","","","Funding text 1: Open access funding provided by University of Turku (UTU) including Turku University Central Hospital.

From the PsyCorona database, we obtained longitudinal data from 23 countries, collected between March and May 2020. The results demonstrated that although online contacts help to reduce feelings of loneliness, people who feel more lonely are less likely to use that strategy. Solidarity played only a small role in shaping feelings of loneliness during lockdown. Thus, it seems we must look beyond the current focus on online contact and solidarity to help people address feelings of loneliness during lockdown. Finally, online contacts did not function as a substitute for face-to-face contacts outside the home—in fact, more frequent online contact in earlier weeks predicted more frequent face-to-face contacts in later weeks. As such, this work provides relevant insights into how individuals manage the impact of restrictions on their social lives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Loneliness; Longitudinal Methodology; Online Communication; Solidarity; Communicable Disease Control; Human; Loneliness; Longitudinal Study; Communicable Disease Control; Covid-19; Humans; Loneliness; Longitudinal Studies","communicable disease control; human; loneliness; longitudinal study; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Loneliness; Longitudinal Studies","","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75-71015), the University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund), and the Spanish government (COV20/00086).","Arthur, Rudy, Studying the UK job market during the COVID-19 crisis with online job ads, PLOS ONE, 16, 5 May, (2021); Baumeister, Roy F., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 117, 3, pp. 497-529, (1995); Berry, Daniel J., On the Practical Interpretability of Cross-Lagged Panel Models: Rethinking a Developmental Workhorse, Child Development, 88, 4, pp. 1186-1206, (2017); Brooks, Samantha Kelly, The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence, The Lancet, 395, 10227, pp. 912-920, (2020); Loneliness Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection, (2008); Caplan, Scott E., Preference for Online Social Interaction: A Theory of Problematic Internet Use and Psychosocial Well-Being, Communication Research, 30, 6, pp. 625-648, (2003); Die Welt, (2020); Loneliness A Sourcebook of Current Theory Research and Therapy, (1982); Sociaal En Cultureel Planbureau, (2020); Dienlin, Tobias, Reinforcement or Displacement?

We examined the association between parental absence in childhood and depressive symptoms among rural community dwellers in Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam. Methods: Data came from 3000 individuals aged 40–60 years old who participated in the baseline survey of the Khanh Hoa Cardiovascular Study. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Self-reported information on parental absence due to death, divorce, or outmigration to other locations before the age of 15 was also obtained. A Poisson regression analysis with a robust variance estimator was used to examine associations. Results: Experiencing parental absence at 3 - < 15 years old and before 3 years old was associated with a 1.21 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.43) and 1.41 times (95% CI = 1.15–1.73) higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, respectively (p trend <0.001). When examining the associations by the different reasons for the parental absence, the strongest association was found for parental absence due to outmigration to other locations. Limitations: We had no information on who respondents lived with after they experienced parental absence. In addition, self-reported information on childhood experiences was subject to recall bias. Conclusions: In rural Vietnam, parental absence during childhood was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of depressive symptoms in middle adulthood. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Depression; Parental Absence; Vietnam; Adult; Adulthood; Article; Childhood; Controlled Study; Death; Depression; Depression Assessment; Divorce; Female; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Aged; Parental Behavior; Rural Population; Self Report; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Child; Child Parent Relation; Preschool Child; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Depression; Divorce; Humans; Middle Aged; Parents; Rural Population; Vietnam","adult; adulthood; Article; childhood; controlled study; death; depression; depression assessment; divorce; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; parental behavior; rural population; self report; Viet Nam; adolescent; child; child parent relation; preschool child; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Depression; Divorce; Humans; Middle Aged; Parents; Rural Population; Vietnam","","","This study was financially supported by the National Center for Global Health and Medicine ( 19A06 , 22A02 ), the Pfizer Health Research Foundation , and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( KAKANHI JP19K20536 , JP21K17301 , JP21J01171 ).

To overcome such challenges, a novel GTAW process has been developed for joining ultra-thin metal sheets for the first time. The novel welding torch with a novel orifice is the main discovered point of this process. In this paper, the novelties of the developed technology are clarified by comparing it with the conventional GTAW process. The results show that the novel GTAW process features much distinctiveness as compared to the conventional GTAW process: (i) the arc plasma column is more concentrated; (ii) the heat input is considerably reduced, but the temperature at the arc center is greatly increased; (iii) the metal evaporation and the metal vapor amount attached to the tungsten electrode surface are enormously reduced, and (iv) the corrosion of the tungsten electrode tip is vastly reduced. As a result, the novel GTAW process can successfully perform the butt weld of thin/ultra-thin metal sheets (up to 0.03 mm) with high quality and reliability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Butt Weld; Low Heat Input; Novel Gtaw Process; Novel Orifice; Ultra-thin Metal Sheet; Butt Welding; Corrosion; Joining; Orifices; Sheet Metal; Tungsten; Welding Electrodes; Butt Weld; Gtaw Process; Heat Input; Low Heat Inputs; Novel Gtaw Process; Novel Orifice; Thin Sheet; Tungsten Electrodes; Ultra-thin; Ultra-thin Metal Sheets; Welds","Butt welding; Corrosion; Joining; Orifices; Sheet metal; Tungsten; Welding electrodes; Butt weld; GTAW process; Heat input; Low heat inputs; Novel GTAW process; Novel orifice; Thin sheet; Tungsten electrodes; Ultra-thin; Ultra-thin metal sheets; Welds","","","This research is supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) in project code VINIF.2020.DA12.","Takeda, Yasunori, Fabrication of Ultra-Thin printed organic TFT CMOS logic circuits optimized for low-voltage wearable sensor applications, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Tisza, Miklós, Comparative study of the application of steels and aluminium in lightweight production of automotive parts, International Journal of Lightweight Materials and Manufacture, 1, 4, pp. 229-238, (2018); undefined; Abioye, T.

The heightened levels of stress that accompanied the crisis were also expected to affect parenting in many families. Since it is known that high levels of stress in the parenting domain can lead to a condition that has severe consequences for health and well-being, we examined whether the prevalence of parental burnout in 26 countries (9,923 parents; 75% mothers; mean age 40) increased during COVID-19 compared to few years before the pandemic. In most (but not all) countries, analyses showed a significant increase in the prevalence of parental burnout during the pandemic. The results further revealed that next to governmental measures (e.g., number of days locked down, homeschooling) and factors at the individual and family level (e.g., gender, number of children), parents in less (vs. more) indulgent countries suffered more from parental burnout. The findings suggest that stricter norms regarding their parenting roles and duties in general and during the pandemic in particular might have increased their levels of parental burnout. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Culture; Indulgence; Parental Burnout; Prevalence","","","","This research was supported by Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research Grants Corona: Fast-track granted to the first author (NOW 440.20.034).","Parenting Stress Index, (1995); Akaike, Hirotsugu, Fitting autoregressive models for prediction, Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 21, 1, pp. 243-247, (1969); Beugelsdijk, Sjoerd, Are Scores on Hofstede's Dimensions of National Culture Stable over Time?

However, an effective measure of spatiotemporal regularity for tensors is still lacking. This study proposes an entropy measure for tensors, tensor approximate entropy (TensorApEn), to evaluate the regularity or complexity within tensors. TensorApEn is calculated by examining the conditional probabilities of the inherent similarities in tensors. Experiments are performed on general tensors and sleep tensors, where general tensors are formatted from common time series, and sleep tensors from electroencephalographs (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG). Results demonstrate that TensorApEn has good consistency and discrimination abilities, and is statistically significant across six sleep stages (Wake, S1, S2, S3, S4, and REM) on 59481 sleep tensors from 61 subjects. In the sleep scoring task, compared to traditional entropy measures and existing works, TensorApEn shows higher classification accuracies of 96.45%, 91.87%, 85.43%, 83.76%, and 80.73% in 2- to 6-class classification modes, respectively, and the corresponding highest Kappa indices are 0.93, 0.88, 0.87, 0.83, and 0.82. It is concluded that TensorApEn is superior in evaluating complexity of tensors in both time and spatial dimensions, and this work also provides a valuable supplement to the research of tensors and the family of entropy measures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eeg; Entropy; Eog; Sleep Stage Scoring; Tensor; Tensor Approximate Entropy; Data Handling; Entropy; Sleep Research; Tensors; Time Series; Conditional Probabilities; Discrimination Ability; Effective Measures; Electro-oculogram; Entropy Measure; Manipulation Techniques; Sleep Stage; Sleep Stage Scoring; Tensor Approximate Entropy; Times Series; Electroencephalography","Data handling; Entropy; Sleep research; Tensors; Time series; Conditional probabilities; Discrimination ability; Effective measures; Electro-oculogram; Entropy measure; Manipulation techniques; Sleep stage; Sleep stage scoring; Tensor approximate entropy; Times series; Electroencephalography","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62001111 ; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China under Grant BK20200364 ; in part by the Aviation Science Foundation Project, China under Grant 20200029069001 ; in part by the Jiangsu Provincial Double-Innovation Doctor Program, China under Grant JSSCBS20211353 .

A coarse-grained sentiment analysis at the document level and a sentiment analysis at the sentence level can only judge an entire text comprehensively, whereas a fine-grained sentiment analysis distinguishes each concrete aspect of the text and makes separate judgments on the sentiment polarity. The word vector representation obtained by a recurrent neural network lacks a description of the distance relationship between the context words and aspect, and traditional models rarely consider the influence of the association between contextual sentences. In this paper, we propose an aspect-level sentiment analysis model with aspect-specific contextual location information. By designing two asymmetrical contextual position weight functions respectively, the model adjusts the weight of contextual words according to the positions of the aspect words in the sentences, and alleviates the interference of the difference in the number of words on both sides of the aspect words on the judgment of sentimental polarity. By utilizing single-sentence-level and multiple-sentence-level bidirectional GRU layers, model will extract the influence of the contextual association of each sentence in the document on the aspect sentiment polarity of individual sentences. In addition, we analyze the distribution properties of hard samples and design a novel loss function for the class imbalance problem in the field of sentiment analysis. For dataset 15Rest, the accuracy of our model is 4.27% higher than that of ASGCN, whereas the f1-score, which is more indicative of the classification performance on an imbalanced dataset, can be seen to be improved by 4.31% in comparison to the ASGCN. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis; Class Imbalance; Natural Language Processing; Classification (of Information); Recurrent Neural Networks; Aspect-level Sentiment Analyse; Class Imbalance; Coarse-grained; Context-word; Fine Grained; Position Information; Sentence Level; Sentiment Analysis; Vector Representations; Word Vectors","Classification (of information); Recurrent neural networks; Aspect-level sentiment analyse; Class imbalance; Coarse-grained; Context-word; Fine grained; Position information; Sentence level; Sentiment analysis; Vector representations; Word vectors","","","This study was supported by the National Key Technology R&D Program of China (No. 2020AAA0109300) and the Opening Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, China (AGK2019004).","Pang, Bo, Opinion mining and sentiment analysis, Computational Linguistics, 35, 2, pp. 311-312, (2009); Schouten, Kim, Survey on Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 28, 3, pp. 813-830, (2016); Majumder, Navonil, Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification with Multitask Learning, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 34, 3, pp. 38-43, (2019); Tang, Duyu, Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network, pp. 214-224, (2016); Tang, Jialong, Progressive self-supervised attention learning for aspect-level sentiment analysis, pp. 557-566, (2020); He, Ruidan, An unsupervised neural attention model for aspect extraction, 1, pp. 388-397, (2017); undefined, (2016); Statistical Language Models Based on Neural Networks, (2012); Mnih, Volodymyr, Recurrent models of visual attention, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 3, January, pp. 2204-2212, (2014); Wang, Xiaodi, A novel network with multiple attention mechanisms for aspect-level sentiment analysis, Knowledge-Based Systems, 227, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125861685"

Valence and arousal are fundamental, and a key question–the focus of the present study–is the relationship between them. Valence is sometimes thought to be independent of arousal, but, in some studies (representing too few societies in the world) arousal was found to vary with valence. One common finding is that arousal is lowest at neutral valence and increases with both positive and negative valence: a symmetric Vshaped relationship. In the study reported here of self-reported affect during a remembered moment (N = 8,590), we tested the valence-arousal relationship in 33 societies with 25 different languages. The two most common hypotheses in the literature–independence and a symmetric V-shaped relationship–were not supported. With data of all samples pooled, arousal increased with positive but not negative valence. Valence accounted for between 5% (Finland) and 43% (China Beijing) of the variance in arousal. Although there is evidence for a structural relationship between the two, there is also a large amount of variability in this relation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arousal; Culture; Structure Of Affect; Subjective Experience; Valence; Arousal; Article; China; Finland; Human; Language; Major Clinical Study; Negative Valence; Organization","arousal; article; China; Finland; human; language; major clinical study; negative valence; organization","","","Preparation of the article was facilitated by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council’s General Research Fund (Projects 16651916 and 16601818) awarded to Michelle Yik.

Our study aimed to identify important predictors of this set of behaviors. Whereas social and health psychological theories suggest a limited set of predictors, machine-learning analyses can identify correlates from a larger pool of candidate predictors. We used random forests to rank 115 candidate correlates of infection-prevention behavior in 56,072 participants across 28 countries, administered in March to May 2020. The machine-learning model predicted 52% of the variance in infection-prevention behavior in a separate test sample—exceeding the performance of psychological models of health behavior.

In this paper, by considering both two perspectives, we first combine the incremental technology and the accelerated strategy in attribute reduction. On the one hand, we utilize the stable attribute group generated by DBSCAN to accelerate the process of searching reduction. On the other hand, we propose the matrix-based incremental mechanisms to dynamic attribute reduction when the objects are evolved over time. Moreover, these two methods are fused together in a unified algorithm of reduction.

Because the amygdala has been implicated in avoidance and emotional behaviors to biologically relevant stimuli and has neural connections with subcortical nuclei involved with vision, amygdalar neurons would be sensitive to snakes and emotional faces. In this study, neuronal activity in the amygdala was recorded from Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) during discrimination of eight categories of visual stimuli including snakes, monkey faces, human faces, carnivores, raptors, non-predators, monkey hands, and simple figures. Of 527 amygdalar neurons, 95 responded to one or more stimuli. Response characteristics of the amygdalar neurons indicated that they were more sensitive to the snakes and emotional faces than other stimuli. Response magnitudes and latencies of amygdalar neurons to snakes and monkey faces were stronger and faster than those to the other categories of stimuli, respectively. Furthermore, response magnitudes to the low pass-filtered snake images were larger than those to scrambled snake images. Finally, analyses of population activity of amygdalar neurons suggest that snakes and emotional faces were represented separately from the other stimuli during the 50–100 ms period from stimulus onset, and neutral faces during the 100–150 ms period. These response characteristics indicate that the amygdala processes fast and coarse visual information from emotional faces and snakes (but not other predators of primates) among the eight categories of the visual stimuli, and suggest that, like anthropoid primate visual systems, the amygdala has been shaped over evolutionary time to detect appearance of potentially threatening stimuli including both emotional faces and snakes, the first of the modern predators of primates. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amygdala; Emotional Faces; Macaque; Single-unit Activity; Snakes; Amygdala; Animal Experiment; Article; Carnivore; Face; Macaca Fuscata; Nerve Cell; Nonhuman; Predator; Raptor; Single Unit Activity; Snake; Threat; Visual Information; Visual System","amygdala; animal experiment; article; carnivore; face; Macaca fuscata; nerve cell; nonhuman; predator; raptor; single unit activity; snake; threat; visual information; visual system","","","The study was supported partly by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (20H03417) from Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS), and research grants from University of Toyama.

Consequently, many countries have adopted restrictive measures that caused a substantial change in society. Within this framework, it is reasonable to suppose that a sentiment of societal discontent, defined as generalized concern about the precarious state of society, has arisen. Literature shows that collectively experienced situations can motivate people to help each other. Since societal discontent is conceptualized as a collective phenomenon, we argue that it could influence intention to help others, particularly those who suffer from coronavirus. Thus, in the present study, we aimed (a) to explore the relationship between societal discontent and intention to help at the individual level and (b) to investigate a possible moderating effect of societal discontent at the country level on this relationship. To fulfil our purposes, we used data collected in 42 countries (N = 61,734) from the PsyCorona Survey, a cross-national longitudinal study. Results of multilevel analysis showed that, when societal discontent is experienced by the entire community, individuals dissatisfied with society are more prone to help others. Testing the model with longitudinal data (N = 3,817) confirmed our results. Implications for those findings are discussed in relation to crisis management.

HUSPM algorithms discover useful information from data. However, looking at the dark side, the sensitive patterns can also be disclosed by the competitors, who use a HUSPM algorithm on the leaked data. Therefore, high-utility sequential pattern hiding (HUSPH) is used to protect the privacy information from HUSPM algorithms. This paper proposes three algorithms named High Utility Sequential Pattern Hiding Using Pure Array Structure (USHPA), High Utility Sequential Pattern Hiding Using Parallel Strategy (USHP), and High Utility Sequential Pattern Hiding Using Random Distribution Strategy (USHR) for hiding high-utility sequential patterns on quantitative sequence datasets. These algorithms use a proposed data structure named Pattern Utility Set for Hiding (PUSH) to speed up the hiding process. We also introduce a metric called Privacy Factor to evaluate the quality of hiding results. The comparative experiments were conducted on real datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of runtime, memory consumption, scalability, missing cost, and privacy factor. Results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently sanitize the input datasets, and they outperform the compared algorithms for all metrics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High-utility Sequential Pattern Hiding; High-utility Sequential Pattern Mining; Parallel Hiding; Privacy Preserving Utility Mining; Data Mining; Privacy-preserving Techniques; High-utility Sequential Pattern Hiding; High-utility Sequential Pattern Mining; Multi-core Parallels; Parallel Hiding; Privacy Preserving; Privacy Preserving Utility Mining; Sequential Pattern Mining Algorithm; Sequential Patterns; Sequential-pattern Mining; Utility Mining; Quality Control","Data mining; Privacy-preserving techniques; High-utility sequential pattern hiding; High-utility sequential pattern mining; Multi-core parallels; Parallel hiding; Privacy preserving; Privacy preserving utility mining; Sequential pattern mining algorithm; Sequential patterns; Sequential-pattern mining; Utility mining; Quality control","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 102.05-2018.307 .","Tedersoo, Leho, Data sharing practices and data availability upon request differ across scientific disciplines, Scientific Data, 8, 1, (2021); Yeh, Jiehshan, HHUIF and MSICF: Novel algorithms for privacy preserving utility mining, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 7, pp. 4779-4786, (2010); Fung, Benjamin C.M., Privacy-preserving data publishing: A survey of recent developments, ACM Computing Surveys, 42, 4, (2010); Evfimievski, Alexandre V., Privacy preserving mining of association rules, Information Systems, 29, 4, pp. 343-364, (2004); Gan, Wensheng Sheng, Privacy Preserving Utility Mining: A Survey, pp. 2617-2626, (2018); Dinh, Tai Tai, A Survey of Privacy Preserving Utility Mining, Studies in Big Data, 51, pp. 207-232, (2019); Dinh, Tai Tai, A novel approach for hiding high utility sequential patterns, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 03-04-December-2015, pp. 121-128, (2015); Quang, Minh Nguyen, MHHUSP: An integrated algorithm for mining and Hiding High Utility Sequential Patterns, pp. 13-18, (2016); Quang, Minh Nguyen, An approach to decrease execution time and difference for hiding high utility sequential patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9978 LNAI, pp. 435-446, (2016); Le, Bac Hoai, An efficient algorithm for Hiding High Utility Sequential Patterns, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 95, pp. 77-92, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121496624"

The former focuses on the decision maker's dynamic behavior without considering the time-evolving data, and the latter emphasizes on dealing with dynamic mixed data over time by multi-stage decision-making. We firstly utilize four T-norm operators and kernel-based similarity relations to integrate different types of dynamic data. Then the subjective and objective models of sequential three-way decision are investigated based on decision thresholds, attribute importance and cost reduction.

Inequalities have been greatly reduced in areas such as education or employment. Because inequalities lead to distress, this development has largely benefited women. One notable exception is the realm of parenting, which has remained rife with inequalities even in the most egalitarian countries. We hypothesized that experiencing inequality in parenting when one holds egalitarian values and raising a child in a country characterized by a high level of gender equality in other areas, increases mothers’ psychological distress in the specific area of parenting. Multilevel modeling analyses computed among 11,538 mothers from 40 countries confirmed this prediction: high egalitarian values at the individual level and high gender equality at the societal level are associated with higher burnout levels in mothers. The associations hold beyond differences in sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level and beyond economic disparities at the societal level. These findings show the importance of egalitarian values and gender equality and their paradoxical effect when inequalities are still present in specific areas as parenting. This study reveals the crucial need to act not only at the micro level but also at the macro level to promote gender equality in parenting and prevent parental burnout. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Egalitarian Values; Family Policies; Gender Equality Paradox; Parental Burnout","","","","","Amato, Paul R., Continuity and change in marital quality between 1980 and 2000, Journal of Marriage and Family, 65, 1, pp. 1-22, (2003); Eryılmaz, Günce Sabah, Validation of the Turkish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA), New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2020, 174, pp. 15-32, (2020); Bianchi, Suzanne M., Housework: Who did, does or will do it, and how much does it matter?, Social Forces, 91, 1, pp. 55-63, (2012); Brycz, Hanna, Cross-cultural differences in metacognitive self, Economics and Sociology, 8, 1, pp. 157-164, (2015); Theory of Fertility Decline, (1982); La Gobernabilidad En America Latina Balance Reciente Y Tendencias A Futuro, (2005); Egypt Statistics, (2021); Chen, Ying, Positive parenting improves multiple aspects of health and well-being in young adulthood, Nature Human Behaviour, 3, 7, pp. 684-691, (2019); Cheung, Gordon Wai Hung, Evaluating goodness-of-fit indexes for testing measurement invariance, Structural Equation Modeling, 9, 2, pp. 233-255, (2002); Coltrane, Scott E., Research on household labor: Modeling and measuring the social embeddedness of routine family work, Journal of Marriage and Family, 62, 4, pp. 1208-1233, (2000)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","00220221; 15525422","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125801434"

One of the most critical issues in dealing with the multipath transmission is appropriately scheduling the pathways in order to guarantee QoS. Despite the fact that tremendous effort has been put into developing multipath scheduling algorithms, existing approaches suffer from several limitations when dealing with the network's dynamicity, including congestion and packet loss. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforcement learning-based multipath transport protocol named SATO, which efficiently schedules multipath communication in heterogeneous wireless networks. By leveraging the self-learning ability of reinforcement learning, a node equipped with SATO can capture the environmental changes and select transmission paths based on an appropriate policy to optimize QoS. Our evaluation results show that SATO improves the QoS by 10%-15% in simulation and 12% in a real deployment compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mpquic; Multipath Scheduling; Q-learning; 5g Mobile Communication Systems; Heterogeneous Networks; Internet Protocols; Scheduling Algorithms; Wireless Networks; Commercialisation; Critical Issues; Heterogeneous Wireless Network; Mpquic; Multipath Scheduling; Multipath Transport Protocols; Network Generation; Q-learning; Reinforcement Learnings; Single Path; Reinforcement Learning","5G mobile communication systems; Heterogeneous networks; Internet protocols; Scheduling algorithms; Wireless networks; Commercialisation; Critical issues; Heterogeneous wireless network; MPQUIC; Multipath scheduling; Multipath transport protocols; Network generation; Q-learning; Reinforcement learnings; Single path; Reinforcement learning","","","","Paasch, Christoph, Multipath TCP, Communications of the ACM, 57, 4, pp. 51-57, (2014); De Coninck, Quentin, Multipath QUIC: Design and evaluation, pp. 160-166, (2017); Ferlin, Simone, BLEST: Blocking estimation-based MPTCP scheduler for heterogeneous networks, pp. 431-439, (2016); Lim, Yeonsup, ECF: An MPTCP path scheduler to manage heterogeneous paths, pp. 147-159, (2017); Wu, Hongjia, Peekaboo: Learning-Based Multipath Scheduling for Dynamic Heterogeneous Environments, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 38, 10, pp. 2295-2310, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CAS); IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc); IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA); IEEE Reliability Society (RS); IEEE Signal Processing Society","8th IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things, WF-IoT 2022","","Hybrid, Yokohama","189841","","9781665491532","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164112314"

Among research directions, spatiotemporal-graph-based traffic forecasting has been known as one of the popular directions. Unfortunately, many requirements, such as lightweight architecture, low resource consumption, and flexible transfer learning, have not had satisfactory answers. Hence, we propose a new method called 3D Spatial Temporal Graph Point-wise Convolutional Network (3D-STGPCN) to address these requirements. Differing from others, we proceed with spatial and temporal information simultaneously (i.e., wrap them into one structure). We evaluate and compare our model on three public traffic network datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and STREETS, with different methods in the same domain.

GenEmC includes three main steps including data preparation, embedding decoder training, and generator training. The embedding decoder is learned to convert embedding vectors to texts. The generator is trained by a two-term loss to generate adversarial embedding vectors from original texts. After three steps, the combination of two trained models could generate adversarial texts instantly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GenEmC, the experiments are conducted on the IMDB dataset. The target classifiers are well-trained GRU, LSTM, and Bert. GenEmC is compared with two well-known rule-based replacement methods known as PWWS and TextBugger. The experiments have demonstrated that for 1,000 texts in test set, while the computational cost of GenEmC is an average of about 6 minutes, the others require at least 10 hours. Besides, the average success rate and semantic-preserving output score of GenEmC is moderately higher than those of PWWS and TextBugger. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adversarial Text Generation; Embedding-based Text Classification; Robustness Testing; Untargeted Attack; Decoding; Embeddings; Long Short-term Memory; Semantics; Text Processing; Adversarial Text Generation; Computational Costs; Embedding-based Text Classification; Robustness Testing; Rule Based; Text Classification; Text Classifiers; Text Generations; Untargeted Attack; Classification (of Information)","Decoding; Embeddings; Long short-term memory; Semantics; Text processing; Adversarial text generation; Computational costs; Embedding-based text classification; Robustness testing; Rule based; Text classification; Text classifiers; Text generations; Untargeted attack; Classification (of information)","","","Kha Do Minh was funded by Vingroup JSC and supported by the Master, PhD Scholarship Programme of Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF), Institute of Big Data, code VINIF.2021.ThS.24.

Simulating and analyzing this system could be an effective solution for experimenting with smart grid cybersecurity. This research identified the necessity for practical cybersecurity experimentation for the smart grid, and a method-ology was proposed to enable such investigation successfully. Furthermore, a general smart grid cybersecurity architecture that satisfies these requirements was designed and implemented in two systems named GridAttackSim and GridAttackAnalyzer.

However, localization based on only a monocular camera or visual odometry is one of the most challenging research topics. Conventional methods are proposed based on the detection of key features in each image and matching them on consecutive images to estimate the camera motions. Deep-learning methods have also been studied to solve the problem. Although the current learning-based visual odometry methods score high results on public datasets, there is a lack of real-time implementation of the methods in common robot operating systems such as ROS to integrate them into a navigation system. In this paper, we introduce a ROS implementation of state-of-the-art conventional feature-based method, ORB-SLAM3, together with a deep-learning-based method, SC-SfMLearner for real-time UAV localization. A photo-realistic simulator, Flightmare, is used to test the implementation together with another navigation task such as control. The implementation can evaluate both algorithms in real-time operation to compare their performances. Based on evaluation results from the simulated environments, the limitation or failure cases of the algorithms could be found, then, the best parameters of the algorithms can be adjusted to improve the algorithms to avoid failures in practical experiments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Flightmare; Orb-slam3; Ros Implementation; Visual Odometry; Cameras; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Navigation Systems; Real Time Control; Robot Operating System; Robot Vision; State Estimation; Vision; Visual Servoing; Feature-based; Flightmare; Gps/imu; Localisation; Monocular Cameras; Orb-slam3; Real- Time; Ros Implementation; Visual Odometry; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav)","Cameras; Deep learning; Learning systems; Navigation systems; Real time control; Robot Operating System; Robot vision; State estimation; Vision; Visual servoing; Feature-based; Flightmare; GPS/IMU; Localisation; Monocular cameras; ORB-SLAM3; Real- time; ROS implementation; Visual odometry; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is funded by the Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) under project number NDT/AT/22/09.","Nistér, David, Visual odometry, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1, pp. I652-I659, (2004); Baker, Simon, Lucas-Kanade 20 years on: A unifying framework, International Journal of Computer Vision, 56, 3, pp. 221-255, (2004); Zhou, Tinghui, Unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion from video, 2017-January, pp. 6612-6621, (2017); Bian, Jiawang, Unsupervised scale-consistent depth and ego-motion learning from monocular video, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, (2019); Geiger, Andreas, Are we ready for autonomous driving? the KITTI vision benchmark suite, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3354-3361, (2012); Burri, Michael, The EuRoC micro aerial vehicle datasets, International Journal of Robotics Research, 35, 10, pp. 1157-1163, (2016); Corr, (2016); Campos, Carlos, ORB-SLAM3: An Accurate Open-Source Library for Visual, Visual-Inertial, and Multimap SLAM, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 37, 6, pp. 1874-1890, (2021); Flightmare A Flexible Quadrotor Simulator, (2020); Furrer, Fadri, RotorS—A modular gazebo MAV simulator framework, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 625, pp. 595-625, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","11th International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences, ICCAIS 2022","","Hanoi","185694","","9781665452489","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146438411"

The ASR architecture is hierarchically presented by three layers. The upper layer determines the total traction force based on the control of vehicle velocity. The middle layer determines optimum tire longitudinal force distribution depending on the total tire workload. In case of wheel slip, the optimum longitudinal force will be adjusted by the FPID controller. In the lower layer, the traction forces are converted to reference torque for each powertrain. The modeling and control organization of the studied vehicle are presented by using energetic macroscopic representation (EMR).

Design/methodology/approach - Eleven managers attended and applied the Q-sort method to evaluate the unidimensionality, reliability and validity of research concepts. Afterwards, a comparative model containing the single effects of risks on supply chain performance was developed as a basis for comparison with the theoretical model. The impacts of each risk on supply chain performance were demonstrated in both models. When the parameters of the theoretical model are greater than those in the competitive model, the resonant effect mechanism is proven and vice versa. Findings - 63% variance of supply chain performance was explained by our risk model, which includes positive and negative resonant effects between risks. It is a remarkable rate compared with the comparative model and previous studies. Whilst a positive relationship (α ≥ 0) increases the effect of the impacted risk on the output, a negative relationship (α ≤ 0) decreases this effect, bringing benefits for companies which “see” these opportunities. Thus, practitioners should treat risk as an opportunity rather than a threat. Research limitations/implications - A positive optimal resonant model is necessary to maximize the impact of risks on supply chain performance. Hence, companies can predict the worst-case scenario when six risks occur simultaneously. However, companies can devise mitigating techniques if a negative optimal resonant model is detected. Although risks can not be eliminated, their impact is likely to be abated by using a new paradigm. Originality/value - The data used in this research is from a large-scale survey supported by Japanese Government to promote ASEAN sustainable socio-economic development. This dataset collected during the Covid-19 pandemic to validate our models is an interesting and topical point of this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Risk Management; Supply Chain Management; Supply Chain Performance; Supply Chain Risk Management; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Environmental Impact; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Supply Chain Management; Comparative Modeling; Design/methodology/approach; Reliability And Validity; Resonant Effect; Risks Management; Supply Chain Performance; Supply Chain Risk Management; Supply-chain Risks; Theoretical Modeling; Risk Management","Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Supply chain management; Comparative modeling; Design/methodology/approach; Reliability and validity; Resonant effect; Risks management; Supply chain performance; Supply chain risk management; Supply-chain risks; Theoretical modeling; Risk management","","","Funding text 1: ?Thisworkwassupported(1)byJapaneseGovernmentthroughtheprojectof“AnEmpiricalStudyonServices ?

High-speed rail (HSR) has been mentioned recently and is expected as the best and most modern transport option in long-distance trips in Vietnam. However, research studies have paid scant regard to how HSR’s attributes may affect potential users, and therefore the motivations and barriers to adopting HSR are still unknown. Objectives: This study aimed at examining motivations and barriers to take-up HSR for considering customers’ preference on the proper attributes and levels of HSR. Method: This study drew on a nationwide survey and conjoint analysis to investigate customers’ behaviour. Results: In Vietnam’s context, HSR ticket was found to be the principal barrier to adoption, whereas the speed of HSR was identified as the least important behavioural driver amongst potential HSR users. The results show that HSR design and planning should provide a combination of minimum check-in and waiting time, a 20-min frequency, average speed of 250 km/h, all add-on services and facilities, ticketing of approximately VND 500-700 thousand per 300-500 km and nearby all-day parking. Conclusion: This investigation has demonstrated the value of conjoint analysis to compare a wide range of attributes associated with consumers’ decision to use HSR.

Throughout the regime where the model yields a locally-finite graph, (i.e. for s > d,) we determine the spectral dimension of the associated simple random walk, apart from at the exceptional value d = 1, s = 2, where the spectral dimension is discontinuous. Towards this end, we present various on-diagonal heat kernel bounds, a number of which are new. In particular, the lower bounds are derived through the application of a general technique that utilises the translation invariance of the model. We highlight that, applying this general technique, we are able to partially extend our main result beyond the nearest-neighbour setting, and establish lower heat kernel bounds over the range of parameters s ∈ (d, 2d).

We asked whether the measurement of this fear is trustworthy and comparable across countries. In particular, we explored the measurement invariance and cross-cultural replicability of the widely used Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), testing community samples from 48 countries (N = 14,558). The findings indicate that the FCV-19S has a somewhat problematic structure, yet the one-factor solution is replicable across cultural contexts and could be used in studies that compare people who vary on gender and educational level. The validity of the scale is supported by a consistent pattern of positive correlations with perceived stress and general anxiety. However, given the unclear structure of the FCV-19S, we recommend using latent factor scores, instead of raw scores, especially in cross-cultural comparisons. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coronavirus; Cross-cultural Studies; Fear Of Covid; Measurement Invariance; Armenia; Article; Australia; Austria; Bangladesh; Bosnia And Herzegovina; Brazil; Bulgaria; Chile; China; Colombia; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Croatia; Czech Republic; Ecuador; Educational Status; Estonia; Fear Of Covid 19 Scale; Gender; Ghana; Health Care System; Human; Hungary; India; Indonesia; Iran; Iraq; Israel; Italy; Japan; Kazakhstan; Latvia; Lebanon; Malaysia; Nigeria; Pakistan; Pandemic; Peru; Philippines; Poland; Portugal; Public Health; Respiratory Tract Disease Assessment; Romania; Russian Federation; Serbia; Slovakia; Slovenia; South Africa; Spain; Thailand; Togo; Turkey (republic); Ukraine; United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; Uruguay; Viet Nam","Armenia; Article; Australia; Austria; Bangladesh; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Brazil; Bulgaria; Chile; China; Colombia; coronavirus disease 2019; Croatia; Czech Republic; Ecuador; educational status; Estonia; Fear of COVID 19 scale; gender; Ghana; health care system; human; Hungary; India; Indonesia; Iran; Iraq; Israel; Italy; Japan; Kazakhstan; Latvia; Lebanon; Malaysia; Nigeria; Pakistan; pandemic; Peru; Philippines; Poland; Portugal; public health; respiratory tract disease assessment; Romania; Russian Federation; Serbia; Slovakia; Slovenia; South Africa; Spain; Thailand; Togo; Turkey (republic); Ukraine; United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; Uruguay; Viet Nam","","","Jaros\u0142aw Piotrowski was supported by grant number 2017/26/E/HS6/00282 from the National Science Centre, Poland.

Since the fuzzy neighborhood operator is effective in handling uncertain data, we first define a pair of probabilistic approximation operators via the constructed α-fuzzy neigh borhood class. Then, a 3WD model is explored in decision information systems to address the related issues in the proposed fuzzy probabilistic rough set model. In light of the above works, we establish a novel approach to classify and rank applicants for enterprise talent recruitment problems.

It draws on computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to computationally model, track, and classify human emotions and affective states. While the US once dominated the field in terms of research and citation from 1995–2015, China is now emerging as a global contender in research output, claiming second place for the most cited country from 2016–2020. This article maps the rhizomatic growth and development of scientific publications devoted to emotion-sensing AI technologies. It employs a bibliometric analysis that identifies major national contributors and international alliances in the field over the past 25 years. Contrary to the ongoing political rhetoric of a new Cold War, we argue that there are in fact vibrant AI research alliances and ongoing collaborations between the West and China, especially with the US, despite competing interests and ethical concerns. Our observations of historical data indicate two major collaborative networks: the “US/Asia-Pacific cluster” consisting of the US, China, Singapore, Japan and the “European” cluster of Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Our analysis also uncovers a major shift in the focus of affective computing research away from diagnosis and detection of mental illnesses to more commercially viable applications in smart city design. The discussion notes the state-of-the-art techniques such as the ensemble method of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI as well as the absence of Russia in the list of top countries for scientific output. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study is part of the project “Emotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life”, Grant number JPMJRX19H6, funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019).

In the present study, 9 years after birth, we investigated the effects of perinatal dioxin exposure on mu and theta rhythms by analyzing EEG power during the execution and observation of hand movements, which indicate mirror neuron system activity. Methods: One hundred fifty-five 9-year-old children (86 boys and 69 girls) from the Da Nang birth cohort participated in the EEG examination with free viewing of hand movements. The dioxin levels in their mothers’ breast milk, measured 1 month after birth, were used as perinatal dioxin exposure markers. A log transform of the ratio of EEG power during execution or observation of the hand movements relative to the power during observation of a bouncing ball for theta and mu rhythms was used to evaluate mirror neuron activity. Results: In both brain hemispheres, the log power ratio in the theta band was significantly higher (i.e., less reduction of power) during observation of hand movements in girls exposed to high levels of TCDD. In boys, however, dioxin congeners other than TCDD, including HxCDDs and several PCDF congeners, contributed to increased log power ratios in the theta band. Particularly for PCDF congeners, the log power ratios in the lowest group among 4 exposure groups were lowest and significantly increased (i.e., decreasing reduction of power) with increasing dose. Conclusion: Perinatal TCDD exposure may influence the mirror neuron system of the brain, which plays an important role for social-emotional behavior in children, particularly in girls living in a hot spot of dioxin contamination in Vietnam. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain Development; Dioxin; Eeg Power; Mirror Neuron System; Vietnam; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Dioxins; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Neurofax Mu Eeg-9100; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Dioxin; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxin; Polychlorinated Dibenzofuran; Article; Brain Development; Breast Milk; Child; Cohort Analysis; Concentration (parameter); Concentration Ratio; Contamination; Controlled Study; Electroencephalogram; Emotional Stress; Female; Follow Up; Hand Movement; Human; Male; Milk Level; Mirror Neuron System; Mu Rhythm; Neuromodulation; Participant Observation; Perinatal Exposure; School Child; Sex Difference; Theta Rhythm; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Hand; Infant; Mirror Neuron; Pregnancy; Child; Dioxins; Female; Hand; Humans; Infant; Male; Mirror Neurons; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Pregnancy; Vietnam","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; Article; brain development; breast milk; child; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); concentration ratio; contamination; controlled study; electroencephalogram; emotional stress; female; follow up; hand movement; human; male; milk level; mirror neuron system; mu rhythm; neuromodulation; participant observation; perinatal exposure; school child; sex difference; theta rhythm; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; hand; infant; mirror neuron; pregnancy; Child; Dioxins; Female; Hand; Humans; Infant; Male; Mirror Neurons; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Pregnancy; Vietnam","","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin, 1746-01-6; Dioxins; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins","This work was supported partly by the Ministry of Education, Sports, Science and Culture,　Japan, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) ( 25305024 and 17H04665 ).

The English version of CESD-R was translated into Japanese, and back-translated into English by three native speakers of Japanese and English; then, we selected the version most completely consistent with the original items. The CESD-R was applied to 398 community-dwelling people (191 men: 48.0%, and 207 women: 52.0%) who were over 40 years old. The Japanese version of the CES-D was also carried out in the same population. Factor analysis was performed. Additionally, the correlations between the CESD-R and CES-D results were identified. The CESD-R scores showed a significantly positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.74, p < 0.0005). Analysis of the CESD-R yielded a Cronbach’s alpha result of 0.90. Factor analysis revealed one principal factor in the CESD-R, whereas the original CES-D had two factors because of reversed items. The Japanese version of the CESD-R appears to have the reliability to be applicable for assessing depressive symptoms in population-based samples. However, because the Japanese expressions for some items might be unusual, our study population was also limited; further studies on other populations and on incorporating improved Japanese terminology will be needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ces-d; Cesd-r; Depressive Symptoms; Epidemiological Study; Japanese Version","","","","","Vos, Theo, Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, The Lancet, 388, 10053, pp. 1545-1602, (2016); Kessler, Ronald C., The epidemiology of depression across cultures, Annual Review of Public Health, 34, pp. 119-138, (2013); Jpn J Psychiatr Treat, (2019); Lehti, Arja Helena, Recognition of depression in people of different cultures: A qualitative study, BMC Family Practice, 10, (2009); Tsuboi, Hirohito, Possible connections among job stress, depressive symptoms, lipid modulation and antioxidants, Journal of Affective Disorders, 91, 1, pp. 63-70, (2006); Steer, Robert A., Further evidence for the construct validity of the Beck Depression Inventory-II with psychiatric outpatients, Psychological Reports, 80, 2, pp. 443-446, (1997); Steptoe, Andrew, Depressive symptoms, socio-economic background, sense of control, and cultural factors in university students from 23 countries, International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 14, 2, pp. 97-107, (2007); Cuijpers, Pim, Is excess mortality higher in depressed men than in depressed women?

Sodium was selected as the alkaline element, and a standard wire without sodium (wire 1) and three wires with 0.028, 0.056, and 0.084 mass% sodium (wire 2, 3, and 4) were prototyped. They were observed using a high-speed video camera equipped with laser illumination, which clarified that the droplet transfer frequency tended to increase proportionally with the amount of sodium added. Subsequently, the line spectra of the iron atom (particularly the Fe I 537.1 nm line) and sodium atom (particularly the Na I 589.0 nm line) were primarily observed using a bandpass filter. Iron vapor evaporated from the droplet bottom, while sodium vapor mainly evaporated from the molten wire tip or the neck between the wire and the droplet because of its low boiling point. Because the sodium atom has a low ionization energy, we considered that a new current path of sodium plasma was directly formed from the tip or neck of the molten wire through the arc plasma to the molten pool, bypassing the inside of the droplet. The formation of this new current path was considered to reduce the current of the iron plasma flowing from the droplet bottom reducing the arc pressure and further enhance the electromagnetic force acting on the neck to promote droplet detachment, thereby increasing the metal transfer frequency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline Element; Mcaw; Metal Transfer; Metal Vapor; Atoms; Bandpass Filters; Drops; High Speed Cameras; Iron Compounds; Metals; Sodium Compounds; Video Cameras; Alkaline Elements; Arc-welding; Current Paths; High-speed Video Camera; Laser Illumination; Metal Cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfers; Metal Vapor; Sodium Atom; Transfer Process; Wire","Atoms; Bandpass filters; Drops; High speed cameras; Iron compounds; Metals; Sodium compounds; Video cameras; Alkaline elements; Arc-welding; Current paths; High-Speed video camera; Laser illumination; Metal cored arc welding; Metal transfers; Metal vapor; Sodium atom; Transfer process; Wire","","","The authors are grateful for the support toward this study by a joint research agreement between the Joining and Welding Research Institute, Osaka University, Japan; Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam; Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan; Thai Kobelco Welding Co.

EBF practices are known to vary by population and comparable subnational estimates of prevalence and progress across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are required for planning policy and interventions. Here we present a geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence estimates from 2000 to 2018 across 94 LMICs mapped to policy-relevant administrative units (for example, districts), quantify subnational inequalities and their changes over time, and estimate probabilities of meeting the World Health Organization’s Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) of ≥70% EBF prevalence by 2030. While six LMICs are projected to meet the WHO GNT of ≥70% EBF prevalence at a national scale, only three are predicted to meet the target in all their district-level units by 2030. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Breast Feeding; Developing Country; Geography; Health Disparity; Human; Management; Prevalence; Public Policy; Spatial Analysis; Breast Feeding; Developing Countries; Geography; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Policy Making; Prevalence; Public Policy; Spatial Analysis","breast feeding; developing country; geography; health disparity; human; management; prevalence; public policy; spatial analysis; Breast Feeding; Developing Countries; Geography; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Policy Making; Prevalence; Public Policy; Spatial Analysis","","","Funding text 1: This work was primarily supported by grant no.

However, an accurate prediction of salinity concentration in groundwater remains a challenge due to the complexity of groundwater salinization processes and its influencing factors. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting groundwater salinity and identify its influencing factors. We conducted a study for the coastal multi-layer aquifers of the Mekong River Delta (Vietnam), using a geodatabase of 216 groundwater samples and 14 conditioning factors. We compared the predictive performances of different ML techniques, i.e., the Random Forest Regression (RFR), the Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR), the CatBoost Regression (CBR), and the Light Gradient Boosting Regression (LGBR) models. The model performance was assessed by using root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results show that the CBR model has the highest performance with both training (R2 = 0.999, RMSE = 29.90) and testing datasets (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 205.96, AIC = 720.60, and BIC = 751.04). Ten of the 14 influencing factors, including the distance to saline sources, the depth of screen well, the groundwater level, the vertical hydraulic conductivity, the operation time, the well density, the extraction capacity, the thickness of the aquitard, the distance to fault, and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors for groundwater salinity prediction. The results provide insights for policymakers in proposing remediation and management strategies for groundwater salinity issues in the context of excessive groundwater exploitation in coastal lowland regions. Since the human-induced influencing factors have significantly influenced groundwater salinization, urgent actions should be taken into consideration to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the coastal areas of the Mekong River Delta. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catboost Regression; Groundwater Salinization; Influencing Factors; Mekong Delta; Multi-layer Coastal Aquifers; Aquifers; Decision Trees; Forecasting; Groundwater Resources; Hydraulic Conductivity; Hydrogeology; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Salt Water Intrusion; Water Management; Catboost Regression; Groundwater Salinities; Groundwater Salinizations; Influencing Factor; Machine Learning Algorithms; Mekong Delta; Multi-layer Coastal Aquifer; Multi-layers; Root Mean Square Errors; Viet Nam; Regression Analysis; Algorithm; Coastal Aquifer; Detection Method; Hydraulic Conductivity; Machine Learning; Salinity; Mekong River","Aquifers; Decision trees; Forecasting; Groundwater resources; Hydraulic conductivity; Hydrogeology; Machine learning; Mean square error; Salt water intrusion; Water management; Catboost regression; Groundwater salinities; Groundwater salinizations; Influencing factor; Machine learning algorithms; Mekong Delta; Multi-layer coastal aquifer; Multi-layers; Root mean square errors; Viet Nam; Regression analysis; algorithm; coastal aquifer; detection method; hydraulic conductivity; machine learning; salinity; Mekong River","","","","undefined, (2016); Aeschbach, Werner, Regional strategies for the accelerating global problem of groundwater depletion, Nature Geoscience, 5, 12, pp. 853-861, (2012); Akaike, Hirotsugu, A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, 6, pp. 716-723, (1974); Akbari, Mahdi, The effects of climate change and groundwater salinity on farmers’ income risk, Ecological Indicators, 110, (2020); Akter, Sonia, Impact of drinking water salinity on children's education: Empirical evidence from coastal Bangladesh, Science of the Total Environment, 690, pp. 1331-1341, (2019); Advances and Applications in Geospatial Technology and Earth Resources Proceedings of the International Conference on Geo Spatial Technologies and Earth Resources 2017, (2018); Badaruddin, Sugiarto, Characteristics of active seawater intrusion, Journal of Hydrology, 551, pp. 632-647, (2017); Behera, Ajit Kumar, Identification of seawater intrusion signatures through geochemical evolution of groundwater: a case study based on coastal region of the Mahanadi delta, Bay of Bengal, India, Natural Hazards, 97, 3, pp. 1209-1230, (2019); Binh, Doan Van, Changes to long-term discharge and sediment loads in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta caused by upstream dams, Geomorphology, 353, (2020); Blasco, Mónica, Geochemical evolution of thermal waters in carbonate – evaporitic systems: The triggering effect of halite dissolution in the dedolomitisation and albitisation processes, Journal of Hydrology, 570, pp. 623-636, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","1470160X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105865850"

We report a survey conducted across 41 societies between March and May 2020 (N = 34,526), and test pre-registered hypotheses about how cross-societal differences in cooperation and trust relate to prosocial COVID-19 responses (e.g., social distancing), stringency of policies, and support for behavioral regulations (e.g., mandatory quarantine). We further tested whether cross-societal variation in institutions and ecologies theorized to impact cooperation were associated with prosocial COVID-19 responses, including institutional quality, religiosity, and historical prevalence of pathogens. We found substantial variation across societies in prosocial COVID-19 responses, stringency of policies, and support for behavioral regulations. However, we found no consistent evidence to support the idea that cross-societal variation in cooperation and trust among strangers is associated with these outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results were replicated with another independent cross-cultural COVID-19 dataset (N = 112,136), and in both snowball and representative samples. We discuss implications of our results, including challenging the assumption that managing the COVID-19 pandemic across societies is best modeled as a public goods dilemma. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cooperation; Covid-19; Culture; Institutions; Social Dilemmas; Trust","","","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75-71015), the University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (COV20/00086).

Although useful, the number of discovered sequences is often very large. To find patterns that are more tailored to a user's needs, this paper studies the problem of mining frequent high utility sequences satisfying item constraints. This article proposes a novel algorithm named C-FHUSM to quickly obtain these sequences from two concise representations discovered from a quantitative sequence database, namely frequent generator high utility sequences and frequent closed high utility sequences. The first set is extracted using a novel algorithm named FGenHUSM, while an existing algorithm is applied to extract the second set. C-FHUSM integrates novel pruning techniques to ignore sequences that do not satisfy item constraints early by checking only a small number of representative sequences at the beginning of the mining process. Experimental results show that C-FHUSM can be more than ten times faster and has better scalability than a modified version of the state-of-the-art EHUSM algorithm for mining sequences with item constraints. Moreover, it is found that using C-FHUSM is beneficial when a user frequently changes constraints as results can be updated without rescanning the database. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Frequent Closed High Utility Sequence; Frequent Generator High Utility Sequence; Frequent High Utility Sequence; Mining Patterns With Constraints; Quantitative Sequential Database; Data Mining; Data Mining Tasks; Frequent Closed High Utility Sequence; Frequent Generator High Utility Sequence; Frequent High Utility Sequence; Item Constraint; Mining Pattern With Constraint; Novel Algorithm; Quantitative Sequential Database; Sequence Database; User Need; Database Systems","Data mining; Data mining tasks; Frequent closed high utility sequence; Frequent generator high utility sequence; Frequent high utility sequence; Item constraint; Mining pattern with constraint; Novel algorithm; Quantitative sequential database; Sequence database; User need; Database systems","","","","Abboud, Yacine, CCPM: A scalable and noise-resistant closed contiguous sequential patterns mining algorithm, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10358 LNAI, pp. 147-162, (2017); Abboud, Yacine, C3Ro: An efficient mining algorithm of extended-closed contiguous robust sequential patterns in noisy data, Expert Systems with Applications, 131, pp. 172-189, (2019); Agrawal, Rakesh, Mining sequential patterns, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 3-14, (1995); Ahmed, Chowdhury Farhan, A novel approach for mining high-utility sequential patterns in sequence databases, ETRI Journal, 32, 5, pp. 676-686, (2010); Alkan, Öznur Kirmemis, CRoM and HuspExt: Improving efficiency of high utility sequential pattern extraction, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 27, 10, pp. 2645-2657, (2015); de Amo, Sandra A., First-order temporal pattern mining with regular expression constraints, Data and Knowledge Engineering, 62, 3, pp. 401-420, (2007); Ayres, Jay, Sequential pattern mining using A bitmap representation, pp. 429-435, (2002); Chen, Enhong, Efficient strategies for tough aggregate constraint-based sequential pattern mining, Information Sciences, 178, 6, pp. 1498-1518, (2008); Chen, Yenliang, Discovering time-interval sequential patterns in sequence databases, Expert Systems with Applications, 25, 3, pp. 343-354, (2003); International Journal of Computer Applications, (2015)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104348305"

Given that individuals who believe that life is like a zero-sum game are likely to perceive their daily interactions with others as unfair, we expected that individuals with high BZSG experience more negative affect and fewer positive one, resulting in a lower satisfaction with life. In addition, we examined whether country-level BZSG may play a moderating role in these associations. Data were collected from student samples (N = 7146) in 35 countries. Multilevel modelling revealed that perceived social antagonism in social relations is negatively associated with satisfaction with life and that this relationship is mediated by both positive and negative affect at the individual level. The relation of individual BZSG and negative affect on satisfaction with life were weaker in societies with higher country-level BZSG, suggesting that the effects of BZSG may be less detrimental in these countries. These findings extend previous knowledge about predictors of life satisfaction and suggest that social beliefs might also be an important factor that influences subjective well-being. The contribution of the study is that the separate treatment of life satisfaction and positive and negative affect may be helpful in many research situations, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Belief In A Zero-sum Game; Mml; Subjective Well-being; Swls","","","","The work of Magdalena Żemojtel-Piotrowska and Jarosław Piotrowski was supported by NCN 2016/21/B/HS6/01069.

The objective is to determine if the input data is seen class or unseen class. Traditional deep learning algorithms are not suitable for this task since the algorithm can predict only class in training data. In this paper, the one-class classification algorithm using construction error of image transformation network (OCITN) is proposed. In particular, image transformation network (ITN) is introduced as a subtask, which transforms input image into one image, namely goal image. Moreover, the error of ITN, namely construction error (CE), is computed as a distance metric between the goal image and model output. ITN model is trained using only one-class images and is applied for testing images. Since the model is trained with only one-class images, the CE for one-class is small relative to other classes. Thus, one-class classification is made determining CE is large or small. The proposed method is experimented with using MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Cat-vs-Dog datasets. OCITN shows good results where the goal image has high entropy. Additionally, the extension of OCITN, namely OCITNE, is implemented. This method shows the state of the art performance in MNIST (98.0), Fashion MNIST(95.6), and acceptable performance in CIFAR10(78.4). Furthermore, these methods provide high-speed processing, OCITN process 5291 images, and OCITNE 1261 images per second, 137 times and 33 times faster than state of the art.

This paper focuses on research on multiclass FDP based on the support vector machine (SVM) integrated with the decomposition and fusion methods. Corporate financial status is subdivided into four states: financial soundness, financial pseudosoundness, moderate financial distress and serious financial distress. Three multiclass FDP models are built by integrating the SVM with three decomposition and fusion methods, i.e., one-versus-one (OVO), one-versus-rest (OVR), and error-correcting output coding (ECOC), and they are, respectively called OVO-SVM, OVR-SVM and ECOC-SVM. Empirical research based on data from Chinese listed companies shows that OVO-SVM overall outperforms OVR-SVM and ECOC-SVM and is preferred for multiclass FDP. In addition, all three models trained on the original highly class-imbalanced training dataset cannot obtain satisfying performance, and the data level preprocessing mechanisms that make class distributions balanced in the training dataset can greatly improve their multiclass FDP performance. Compared with multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) and multinomial logit (MNLogit), OVO-SVM has significantly higher accuracy for financial pseudosoundness and moderate financial distress and lower accuracy for financial soundness and serious financial distress, resulting in no significant difference among their overall multiclass FDP performance. However, OVO-SVM is still more competitive than MDA and MNLogit in that financial pseudosoundness and moderate financial distress are much more difficult to predict by human expertise than the other two financial states. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decomposition And Fusion Method; Financial Distress Prediction; Multi-class Classification; Support Vector Machine; Discriminant Analysis; Finance; Forecasting; Multivariant Analysis; Risk Management; Chinese Listed Companies; Class Distributions; Empirical Research; Error-correcting Output Coding; Financial Distress; Financial Distress Prediction; Financial Risk Management; Multivariate Discriminant Analysis; Support Vector Machines","Discriminant analysis; Finance; Forecasting; Multivariant analysis; Risk management; Chinese listed companies; Class distributions; Empirical research; Error-correcting output coding; Financial distress; Financial distress prediction; Financial risk management; Multivariate discriminant analysis; Support vector machines","","","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant numbers 71771162].","Information Technology and Management, (2001); Alam, Pervaiz, The use of fuzzy clustering algorithm and self-organizing neural networks for identifying potentially failing banks: An experimental study, Expert Systems with Applications, 18, 3, pp. 185-199, (2000); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., ZETATM analysis A new model to identify bankruptcy risk of corporations, Journal of Banking and Finance, 1, 1, pp. 29-54, (1977); Altman, Edward I., Corporate distress diagnosis: Comparisons using linear discriminant analysis and neural networks (the Italian experience), Journal of Banking and Finance, 18, 3, pp. 505-529, (1994); Back, Barbro, Neural networks and genetic algorithms for bankruptcy predictions, Expert Systems with Applications, 11, 4 SPEC.

It identifies factors associated with self-reported NCDs and examines socio-economic-related health inequality in self-reported NCDs between rural and urban Vietnamese older people. This cross-sectional study utilised data from the Viet Nam Ageing Survey. A sample of 2,682 older people aged 60 and over (urban = 703, rural = 1,979) was analysed. Concentration indices were computed to measure socio-economic inequalities in self-reported NCDs. Concentration index decomposition analysis was performed to determine the relative contributions of the determinants to explaining those inequalities. Significant socio-economic inequalities in self-reported NCDs favouring the rich were found, in which the degree of inequality was more pronounced in urban areas than in their rural counterparts. Household wealth and social health insurance were the main drivers contributing to increased socio-economic inequalities in self-reported NCDs in urban and rural areas, respectively. Among disadvantaged groups, older people living alone, with lowest wealth and with social health insurance had highest probability of reporting at least one NCD for both areas. Public policies aimed at narrowing wealth gaps and expanding and improving principle roles of social health insurance should prioritise the most disadvantaged groups in order to achieve health equality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ageing; Concentration Index; Decomposition Analysis; Developing Countries; Non-communicable Diseases; Viet Nam; Aging; Concentration (composition); Decomposition Analysis; Developing World; Elderly Population; Health Care; Noncommunicable Disease; Socioeconomic Status; Viet Nam","aging; concentration (composition); decomposition analysis; developing world; elderly population; health care; noncommunicable disease; socioeconomic status; Viet Nam","","","","Basu, Sanjay Y., Disability and chronic disease among older adults in India: Detecting vulnerable populations through the WHO SAGE Study, American Journal of Epidemiology, 178, 11, pp. 1620-1628, (2013); Chantzaras, Athanasios E., Income-related health inequalities among the migrant and native-born populations in Greece during the economic crisis: A decomposition analysis, European Journal of Public Health, 28, pp. 24-31, (2018); Dos Santos Costa, Caroline, Inequalities in multimorbidity among elderly: A population-based study in a city in Southern Brazil, Cadernos de Saude Publica, 34, 11, (2018); Costa-Font, Joan I., Income inequalities in unhealthy life styles in England and Spain, Economics and Human Biology, 13, 1, pp. 66-75, (2014); Social Welfare Policies and the Development of Social Services for the Elderly Under Socialist Oriented Market Economy, (2010); Erreygers, Guido E., Correcting the Concentration Index, Journal of Health Economics, 28, 2, pp. 504-515, (2009); Erreygers, Guido E., Measuring socioeconomic inequality in health, health care and health financing by means of rank-dependent indices: A recipe for good practice, Journal of Health Economics, 30, 4, pp. 685-694, (2011); Population Projections for Vietnam 2014 2049, (2016); Journal of Economics Development, (2016); Economic Studies, (2017)","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","0144686X; 14691779","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078259029"

Due to the routing flexibility, SR has been widely used to solve traffic engineering problems such as minimizing the maximum link utilization. However, most of the prior works only solve the problem in a single snapshot without considering network traffic dynamics, resulting in frequent traffic reroute. To cope with this problem, we focus on solving the segment routing based traffic engineering problem by taking into account the future traffic changes. We formulate the multi-time-step segment routing problem and leverage traffic prediction to extend the length of routing cycles. Due to the large search space of multi-time-step segment routing problem, we further propose a heuristic algorithm for incrementally recomputing the segment routing paths in sub-second. Through extensive experiments on real backbone network traffic datasets, we show that our proposal can achieve a near-optimal performance in term of maximum link utilization while significantly reducing the number of routing changes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heuristic Algorithms; Network Management; Traffic Control; Back-bone Network; Link Utilization; Near-optimal Performance; Network Traffic Dynamics; Routing Flexibility; Routing Problems; Traffic Engineering; Traffic Prediction; Routing Algorithms","Heuristic algorithms; Network management; Traffic control; Back-bone network; Link utilization; Near-optimal performance; Network traffic dynamics; Routing flexibility; Routing problems; Traffic Engineering; Traffic prediction; Routing algorithms","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP20H00592, JP18KK0279 and JP19H04093.","Segment Routing A Comprehensive Survey of Research Activities Standardization Efforts and Implementation Results, (2019); Bhatia, Randeep Singh, Optimized network traffic engineering using segment routing, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 26, pp. 657-665, (2015); Gay, Steven, Expect the unexpected: Sub-second optimization for segment routing, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, (2017); Jadin, Mathieu, CG4SR: Near Optimal Traffic Engineering for Segment Routing with Column Generation, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2019-April, pp. 1333-1341, (2019); Lee, Mingchieh, An efficient routing algorithm based on segment routing in software-defined networking, Computer Networks, 103, pp. 44-55, (2016); Pereira, Vitor, Traffic Engineering with Three-Segments Routing, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 17, 3, pp. 1896-1909, (2020); Azzouni, Abdelhadi, NeuTM: A neural network-based framework for traffic matrix prediction in SDN, pp. 1-5, (2018); Le, Van An, Deep convolutional LSTM network-based traffic matrix prediction with partial information, pp. 261-269, (2019); Gao, Kaihui, Incorporating Intra-flow Dependencies and Inter-flow Correlations for Traffic Matrix Prediction, (2020); Onf White Paper, (2012)","Ahmed, T.; Festor, O.; Ghamri-Doudane, Y.; Kang, J.-M.; Schaeffer-Filho, A.E.; Lahmadi, A.; Madeira, E.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Communications Society; IFIP TC6 Working Group 6.6.","17th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, IM 2021","","Virtual, Bordeaux","171035","","9783903176324","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113647802"

Here, we present cross-cultural data on a brief measure of precarious manhood beliefs (the Precarious Manhood Beliefs scale [PMB]) that covaries meaningfully with other cross-culturally validated gender ideologies and with country-level indices of gender equality and human development. Using data from university samples in 62 countries across 13 world regions (N = 33,417), we demonstrate: (1) the psychometric isomorphism of the PMB (i.e., its comparability in meaning and statistical properties across the individual and country levels); (2) the PMB’s distinctness from, and associations with, ambivalent sexism and ambivalence toward men; and (3) associations of the PMB with nation-level gender equality and human development.

It has been proposed that specific phobia may have an evolutionary origin, and that attentional bias to specific items may promote the onset of phobia. Noninvasive imaging studies of patients with specific phobia reported that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), especially the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and amygdala are activated during the presentation of phobogenic stimuli. We propose that the mPFC-amygdala circuit may be involved in the pathogenesis of phobia. The mPFC receives inputs from the phylogenically old subcortical visual pathway including the superior colliculus, pulvinar, and amygdala, while mPFC neurons are highly sensitive to snakes that are the first modern predator of primates, and discriminate snakes with striking postures from those with non-striking postures. Furthermore, the mPFC has been implicated in the attentional allocation and promotes amygdala-dependent aversive conditioning. These findings suggest that the rACC focuses attention on snakes, and promotes aversive conditioning to snakes, which may lead to anxiety and ophidiophobia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amygdala; Phobia; Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex; Snake Detection Theory; Snakes","","","","Animals were provided by NBRP \u201CJapanese Monkeys\u201D through the National BioResource Project (NBRP) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

It is not yet clear, however, whether parental burnout varies by culture, and if so, why it might do so. In this study, we examined the prevalence of parental burnout in 42 countries (17,409 parents; 71%mothers;M<inf>age</inf> = 39.20) and showed that the prevalence of parental burnout varies dramatically across countries. Analyses of cultural values revealed that individualistic cultures, in particular, displayed a noticeably higher prevalence and mean level of parental burnout. Indeed, individualism plays a larger role in parental burnout than either economic inequalities across countries, or any other individual and family characteristic examined so far, including the number and age of children and the number of hours spent with them.

However, little is known about how salinity affects the structure and function of soil nematodes community in intensive rice cultivated area. This study aimed (1) to assess the impacts of saltwater intrusion on the nematode community in alluvial and acid sulfate soils; and (2) to evaluate its relation with soil conditions. Saltwater intrusion reduced the abundance of both free-living nematodes (FLN) and plant-parasitic nematodes (dominated by Hirschmanniella) in soils. FLN community was different among sites with different physicochemical properties. The omnivorous genera Aporcelaimellus and Thornenema were only found in non-salt-affected alluvial soil, whilst Mesodorylaimus was dominant in salt-affected acid sulfate soil, suggesting that this genus might be tolerant to higher EC and soluble Na+, K+, Ca2+. The bacterivorous nematodes (dominant taxa Chronogaster, Rhabdolaimus) were dominant in both non-salt affected and salt-affected alluvial soils, which accounted for 48% and 40%, respectively, whilst it accounted for 21% in salt-affected acid sulfate soil. The abundance of fungivorous nematodes (Aphelenchoides, Ditylenchus, Filenchus) were greater in salt-affected alluvial soil in contrast to the other treatments, suggesting that these might be tolerant to salinity and low pH. Saltwater intrusion reduced biological diversity (Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, and Hill's indices), maturity index (∑MI, MI25), and clearly affected functional guilds of nematode community, especially c-p 5 group was reduced in both salt-affected soils. This study suggests that saltwater intrusion showed a potential risk in the degradation of soil properties, as indicated by the altered nematode community, trophic structure, functional guilds and their ecological indices in paddy fields. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Indicator Species; Nematode Diversity; Nematode Functional Guild; Paddy Rice; Salinity; Soil Fertility; Ecosystems; Physicochemical Properties; Salt Water Intrusion; Sulfur Compounds; Acid Sulfate Soils; Ecological Indices; Free-living Nematodes; Functional Guilds; Nematode Communities; Paddy Rice Fields; Plant-parasitic Nematodes; Salt-affected Soil; Soils; Abundance; Land Degradation; Nematode; Paddy Field; Rice; Risk Assessment; Saline Intrusion; Soil Microorganism; Sulfate; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Aphelenchoides; Aporcelaimellus; Chronogaster; Ditylenchus; Filenchus; Hirschmanniella; Indicator Indicator; Mesodorylaimus; Nematoda; Rhabdolaimus; Thornenema","Ecosystems; Physicochemical properties; Salt water intrusion; Sulfur compounds; Acid sulfate soils; Ecological indices; Free-living nematodes; Functional guilds; Nematode communities; Paddy rice fields; Plant-parasitic nematodes; Salt-affected soil; Soils; abundance; land degradation; nematode; paddy field; rice; risk assessment; saline intrusion; soil microorganism; sulfate; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Aphelenchoides; Aporcelaimellus; Chronogaster; Ditylenchus; Filenchus; Hirschmanniella; Indicator indicator; Mesodorylaimus; Nematoda; Rhabdolaimus; Thornenema","","","This study was funded in part by the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14-P6, supported by a Japanese ODA loan.

First automatic de-identification systems were based on rules or on machine learning methods, limited by language changes, lack of context awareness and time consuming feature engineering. Newer deep learning techniques for sequence labeling have shown better results with a reduction in feature engineering efforts and the use of word representation techniques in vector space. However, they are not able to jointly represent the polysemic and context-dependent nature of words, as well as their morpho-syntactic mutations characteristic of handwriting. To address these limitations, a new de-identification approach based on deep learning techniques for Named Entity Recognition has been proposed, whose key factors are: (i) a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory + Conditional Random Field architecture for sequence labeling that takes advantage of the widest possible representation context; (ii) a contextualized language model, working at character level, to capture the polysemy of words and manage the morpho-syntactic variations typical of handwritten notes; (iii) more word representations stacked to better capture latent syntactic and semantic similarities. This approach has been tested on the official Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside 2014 de-identification dataset, showing similar or higher performance than state of the art with respect to category and binary recognition, but without any feature engineering or handcrafted rules. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in particular with regard to category level recognition which is essential to correctly replace entities with surrogates for anonymization purposes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical De-identification; Contextualized Embedding; Deep Learning; Named Entity Recognition; Sub-document Level Analysis; Character Recognition; Data Sharing; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Random Processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Vector Spaces; Conditional Random Field; Feature Engineerings; Learning Techniques; Named Entity Recognition; Protected Health Informations; Semantic Similarity; Syntactic Variations; Word Representations; Long Short-term Memory","Character recognition; Data Sharing; Deep learning; Learning systems; Random processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Vector spaces; Conditional random field; Feature engineerings; Learning techniques; Named entity recognition; Protected health informations; Semantic similarity; Syntactic variations; Word representations; Long short-term memory","","","","Vincze, Veronika, De-identification in natural language processing, pp. 1300-1303, (2014); Meystre, Stéphane M., Automatic de-identification of textual documents in the electronic health record: A review of recent research, BMC Medical Research Methodology, 10, (2010); Stubbs, Amber, Automated systems for the de-identification of longitudinal clinical narratives: Overview of 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task Track 1, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 58, pp. S11-S19, (2015); Yadav, Vikas, A survey on recent advances in named entity recognition from deep learning models, pp. 2145-2158, (2018); Akbik, Alan, Contextual string embeddings for sequence labeling, pp. 1638-1649, (2018); Pennington, Jeffrey S., GloVe: Global vectors for word representation, pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Nadeau, David, A survey of named entity recognition and classification, Lingvisticae Investigationes, 30, 1, pp. 3-26, (2007); Dernoncourt, Franck, De-identification of patient notes with recurrent neural networks, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 24, 3, pp. 596-606, (2017); Sweeney, Latanya A., Replacing personally-identifying information in medical records, the Scrub system., Proceedings : a conference of the American Medical Informatics Association / .

In the present study, we examined whether subsequent motor learning can be promoted further by a repetitive passive movement, which reduces the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) before motor learning tasks. We also examined the relationship between motor learning and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Forty healthy subjects (Val/Val genotype, 17 subjects; Met carrier genotype, 23 subjects) participated. Subjects were divided into two groups of 20 individuals each. The first group was assigned to perform the motor learning task after an intervention consisting in the passive adduction–abduction movement of the right index finger at 5 Hz for 10 min (RPM condition), while the second group was assigned to perform the task without the passive movement (control condition). The motor learning task consisted in the visual tracking of the right index finger. The results showed that the corticospinal excitability was transiently reduced after the passive movement in the RPM condition, whereas it was increased to the level detected in the control condition after the motor learning task. Furthermore, the motor learning ability was decreased immediately after the passive movement; however, the motor performance finally improved to the level observed in the control condition. In individuals carrying the Val/Val genotype, higher motor learning was also found to be related to the more remarkable changes in corticospinal excitability caused by the RPM condition. This study revealed that the implementation of a passive movement before a motor learning tasks did not affect M1 excitatory changes and motor learning efficiency; in contrast, in subjects carrying the Val/Val polymorphism, the more significant excitatory changes in the M1 induced by the passive movement and motor learning task led to the improvement of motor learning efficiency. Our results also suggest that homeostatic plasticity occurring in the M1 is involved in this improvement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor; Homeostatic Plasticity; Motor Evoked Potential; Motor Learning; Primary Motor Cortex; Repetitive Passive Movement; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Visual Tracking Task; Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Adult; Amplitude Modulation; Article; Bdnf Gene; Controlled Study; Cortical Excitability; Corticospinal Excitability; Electromyography; Female; Gene; Genetic Polymorphism; Genotype; Human; Human Experiment; Male; Motor Learning; Motor Performance; Normal Human; Passive Movement; Primary Motor Cortex; Repetitive Passive Movement; Task Performance; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","brain derived neurotrophic factor; adult; amplitude modulation; Article; BDNF gene; controlled study; cortical excitability; corticospinal excitability; electromyography; female; gene; genetic polymorphism; genotype; human; human experiment; male; motor learning; motor performance; normal human; passive movement; primary motor cortex; repetitive passive movement; task performance; transcranial magnetic stimulation","","brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) 16H03207 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of Graduate Students of Niigata University of Health and Welfare (H29F02).","Antal, Andrea, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms shape cortical plasticity in humans, Brain Stimulation, 3, 4, pp. 230-237, (2010); Baldelli, Pietro, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor enhances GABA release probability and nonuniform distribution of N- and P/Q-type channels on release sites of hippocampal inhibitory synapses, Journal of Neuroscience, 25, 13, pp. 3358-3368, (2005); Bocci, Tommaso, Evidence for metaplasticity in the human visual cortex, Journal of Neural Transmission, 121, 3, pp. 221-231, (2014); Brasil-Neto, Joaquim Pereira, Central fatigue as revealed by postexercise decrement of motor evoked potentials, Muscle and Nerve, 17, 7, pp. 713-719, (1994); Carvalho, Ana Luisa, Role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor at glutamatergic synapses, British Journal of Pharmacology, 153, SUPPL. 1, pp. S310-S324, (2008); Cheeran, Binith J., A common polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene ( BDNF) modulates human cortical plasticity and the response to rTMS, Journal of Physiology, 586, 23, pp. 5717-5725, (2008); Chen, Robert E., Depression of motor cortex excitability by low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation, Neurology, 48, 5, pp. 1398-1403, (1997); Cirillo, John, Differential modulation of motor cortex excitability in BDNF Met allele carriers following experimentally induced and use-dependent plasticity, European Journal of Neuroscience, 36, 5, pp. 2640-2649, (2012); Di Pino, Giovanni, Val66Met BDNF Polymorphism Implies a Different Way to Recover from Stroke Rather Than a Worse Overall Recoverability, Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair, 30, 1, pp. 3-8, (2016); Egan, Michael F., The BDNF val66met polymorphism affects activity-dependent secretion of BDNF and human memory and hippocampal function, Cell, 112, 2, pp. 257-269, (2003)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","16625161","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101082880"

In an annealed system, we take the average on both sides of the ratio defining the Boltzmann–Gibbs measure of the Ising model. In the configuration model, the degrees are specified. Remarkably, when the degrees are deterministic, the critical value of the annealed Ising model is the same as that for the quenched Ising model. For independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) degrees, instead, the annealed critical value is strictly smaller than that of the quenched Ising model. This identifies the degree structure of the underlying graph as the main driver for the critical value. Furthermore, in both contexts (deterministic or random degrees), we provide the variational expression for the annealed pressure. Interestingly, our rigorous results establish that only part of the heuristic conjectures in the physics literature were correct. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annealed Ising Model; Configuration Model; Critical Temperature; Phase Transition","","","","The work of RvdH is supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through VICI grant 639.033.806 and the Gravitation NETWORKS grant 024.002.003.

To overcome this shortcoming, four types of fuzzy β-neighborhood operators are redefined, which shows that two redefined operators are reflexive. By means of fuzzy logical operators, the (I,T)-fuzzy rough set (ITFRS) model based on the reflexive fuzzy β-neighborhood operators is constructed in this paper. By combining ITFRS models with the classical TOPSIS method, a new decision-making method is proposed to handle multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems under uncertain and fuzzy environments, where the distance between two intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is expressed by an intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN). Meanwhile, both numerical examples with different types of data are given to explain the feasibility of the proposed method and its effectiveness is also illustrated by a comparative analysis. Finally, the stability of the proposed method is further verified based on an experimental analysis in a real-life MCDM problem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covering-based Fuzzy Rough Set; Fuzzy Logical Operator; Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set; Topsis Method; Decision Making; Fuzzy Sets; Numerical Methods; Comparative Analysis; Decision-making Method; Experimental Analysis; Fuzzy Logical Operators; Intuitionistic Fuzzy Number; Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets; Multi-criteria Decision Making; Neighborhood Operators; Rough Set Theory","Decision making; Fuzzy sets; Numerical methods; Comparative analysis; Decision-making method; Experimental analysis; Fuzzy logical operators; Intuitionistic Fuzzy number; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Multi-criteria decision making; Neighborhood operators; Rough set theory","","","Funding text 1: The work of the first and second authors was partially supported by grants from the NNSFC (61866011, 11961025, 11561023, 11461025).

High average utility pattern mining should be able to gratify the anti-monotone property like other pattern mining techniques. Many high average utility pattern mining studies to satisfy the anti-monotone property have been proposed in order to improve various upper-bounds because the performance of pattern mining can be improved efficiently by satisfying the anti-monotone property. Although those upper-bounds can effectively reduce the search space, they still take a lot of cost to calculate all unpromising patterns or cannot find them in advance. Therefore, in this paper, a novel high average utility pattern mining approach is proposed by employing two novel upper-bounds called tight maximum average utility upper-bound and maximum remaining average utility upper-bound. Moreover, a newly suggested list-based structure, TA-List, is designed to adopt two pruning strategies. The proposed technique can efficiently extract high average utility patterns by reducing search space. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, various experiments using real and synthetic datasets are conducted in terms of runtime, memory usage and scalability and the proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art high average utility pattern mining algorithms. The results of experiments show that the suggested algorithm has better performance with regard to runtime, memory usage and scalability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High Average-utility Pattern Mining; List Structure; Maximum Average Utility Upper-bound; Maximum Remaining Average Utility; Pruning Technique; Scalability; Average Utilities; Monotone Properties; Pattern Mining; Pattern Mining Algorithms; Pruning Strategy; Search Spaces; State Of The Art; Synthetic Datasets; Data Mining","Scalability; Average utilities; Monotone properties; Pattern mining; Pattern mining algorithms; Pruning strategy; Search spaces; State of the art; Synthetic datasets; Data mining","","","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology ( NRF No . 2018R1D1A1A09083109 ).","Aggarwal, Apeksha, Frequent pattern mining on time and location aware air quality data, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 98921-98933, (2019); Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, (1994); Ao, Xiang, Mining precise-positioning episode rules from event sequences, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 30, 3, pp. 530-543, (2018); undefined; Belhadi, Asma, A general-purpose distributed pattern mining system, Applied Intelligence, 50, 9, pp. 2647-2662, (2020); Chapela-Campa, David, Mining frequent patterns in process models, Information Sciences, 472, pp. 235-257, (2019); Choi, Hyeokjun, Emerging topic detection in twitter stream based on high utility pattern mining, Expert Systems with Applications, 115, pp. 27-36, (2019); Chon, Kang-wook, GMiner: A fast GPU-based frequent itemset mining method for large-scale data, Information Sciences, 439-440, pp. 19-38, (2018); Deng, Na, Frequent Patterns Mining in DNA Sequence, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 108400-108410, (2019); Deng, Zhihong, An efficient structure for fast mining high utility itemsets, Applied Intelligence, 48, 9, pp. 3161-3177, (2018)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088823841"

When internal customers are satisfied, they will become more loyal and committed to the company. Internal customers will be ready to serve to satisfy and create loyalty of customers outside the business. Thus, internal marketing needs to be done before doing external marketing. The function of internal marketing is that the internal communication between the business and its employees must function effectively before the business can succeed in realizing its goals in relation to the external market. This study aimed to measure the internal marketing components at garment enterprises in Thai Nguyen province. The data was collected from the survey results of officials and employees at garment enterprises in the province. The data were processed by the statistical software SPSS 22.0, the scale was tested by Cronbach Alpha coefficient and the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) model.

Men and women in 15 countries (NTOTAL = 4701) completed self-report measures assessing self-esteem and the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-defeating, and self-enhancing. Each of the country samples had self-esteem averages at or above the midpoint of the scale, but did vary. The samples from Colombia and Serbia had the highest self-esteem values and Russia had the lowest. For all of the country samples, with the exception of Russia, the multiple regression results demonstrated that a greater level of the self-enhancing humor style positively predicted higher self-esteem scores. As the self-enhancing humor style involves improving one’s mood with humor, the results suggest that for the majority of the participants, self-enhancing humor styles also help to increase self-esteem. The results are discussed both within countries and across the samples. In particular, the unique finding that not a self-enhancing humor style but an aggressive humor style predicts self-esteem in the Russian sample is discussed.

Moreover, an RSU can also offload to gNB, forming three offloading paths: vehicle-To-RSU, vehicle-To-gNB, and RSU-To-gNB. This paper aims to minimize the offloaded tasks' average latency while dealing with the network dynamic. Note that the existing works assume the fixed network parameters, hence have failed to address the dynamic. As a solution, we use the multi-Agent multi-Armed bandits (MBA) learning for offloading that can adapt to the network dynamic and optimize the latency. More importantly, we propose a new MBA offloading scheme with an exploration mechanism based on the Sigmoid function. We conduct an extensive evaluation to evaluate and show the superiority of our proposal. First, the proposed Sigmoid exploration mechanism reduces the tasks' average latency by 35% compared to a basic MBA using negative rewarding. Second, the simulation results show our proposed offloading algorithm shortens the task latency by 18.5% on average and 56.9% in the best case, compared to the state-of-The-Art. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Offloading; Reinforcement; V2x; Dynamics; Vehicle To Everything; Vehicles; Cloud-computing; Computational Task; Delay Minimization; Edge Computing; Multi Agent; Multiarmed Bandits (mabs); Network Dynamics; Offloading; Roadside Units; V2x; Multi Agent Systems","Dynamics; Vehicle to Everything; Vehicles; Cloud-computing; Computational task; Delay minimization; Edge computing; Multi agent; Multiarmed bandits (MABs); Network dynamics; Offloading; Roadside units; V2X; Multi agent systems","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 102.01-2020.23.

Such an ability of the HAS is powered by its Adaptive Bitrate Algorithm (ABR), which focuses on maximizing both the visual and audio quality of the video with regards to the user's network condition. However, not all users equally care about both visual and audio quality concurrently. Our subjective assessment on viewing behaviors shows that, for videos with audio-focused content, most of the participants let the video run in the background and move on to other works for a certain time. As a result, maintaining a high visual quality within this period, which current ABRs are doing, becomes unnecessary and thus causes wastage of data. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called Idle-Aware, which adjusts video quality based on the idle behavior of the user the experimental results showed that our solution not only reduces data wastage but also diminishes the rebuffering events under congested networks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abr; Adaptive Streaming; Dash; Data Wastage; Idle User; Behavioral Research; Quality Of Service; Sound Reproduction; Adaptive Bitrate Algorithm; Adaptive Streaming; Audio Quality; Bit Rates; Dash; Data Wastage; Idle User; Online Video Streaming; Video Streaming Services; Visual Qualities; Http","Behavioral research; Quality of service; Sound reproduction; Adaptive bitrate algorithm; Adaptive streaming; Audio quality; Bit rates; DASH; Data wastage; Idle user; Online video streaming; Video streaming services; Visual qualities; HTTP","","","","Techjury, (2021); Cisco, (2016); Bentaleb, Abdelhak, A survey on bitrate adaptation schemes for streaming media over HTTP, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 1, pp. 562-585, (2019); Qin, Yanyuan, ABR streaming with separate audio and video tracks: Measurements and best practices, pp. 158-164, (2019); Mux, (2018); Duc, Tho Nguyen, Convolutional Neural Networks for Continuous QoE Prediction in Video Streaming Services, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 116268-116278, (2020); Ghadiyaram, Deepti, A Subjective and Objective Study of Stalling Events in Mobile Streaming Videos, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 29, 1, pp. 183-197, (2019); Some Videos Won T Play in Background; Netflix; Duc, Tho Nguyen, Modeling of cumulative QoE in on-demand video services: Role of memory effect and degree of interest, Future Internet, 11, 8, (2019)","Hu, J.; Hao, F.; Wang, H.; Wang, M.; Zhang, X.; Zhao, Z.; Wang, Z.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Changsha University of Science and Technology; University of Exeter","20th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications, 20th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology, 4th International Conference on Data Science and Computational Intelligence and 11th International Conference on Smart Computing, Networking, and Services, IUCC/CIT/DSCI/SmartCNS 2021","","London","177763","","9781665466677","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127646157"

Hence, suppression of noise in the sound can improve the robustness of the sound classification model. This paper investigated a sound separation technique that separates the input sound into many overlapped-content Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) frames. Our approach is different from the traditional STFT conversion method, which converts each sound into a single STFT image. Contradictory, separating the sound into many STFT frames improves model prediction accuracy by increasing variability in the data and therefore learning from that variability. These separated frames are saved as images and then labeled manually as clean and noisy frames which are then fed into transfer learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification task. The pre-trained CNN architectures that learn from these frames become robust against the noise. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is robust against noise and achieves 94.14% in terms of classifying 21 classes including 20 classes of sound events and a noisy class.

Countries governments have struggled with conflicting demands from industries benefits and people/natural health. Scientists have investigated to find solutions that can balance these demands. Along with these directions, this research introduces a convenient and economical solution for estimating PM2.5 at the current time and predicting PM2.5 in a short- and medium-term period just by using images captured from personal devices (e.g., smartphones, cameras, lifelog cameras). The proposed method aims to leverage the association between urban nature (e.g., street greenness, street building), urban traffic (e.g., the volume of vehicles), and air pollution (e.g., PM2.5) to discover a set of periodic-frequent patterns and to build the PM2.5 estimation model. The estimated PM2.5, together with a set of patterns, is utilized to predict the PM2.5 in the short-term future.

While an individual can have undeniable evidence for legal and insurance, communities can benefit from sharing these dashcam videos for further traffic education and criminal investigation. Moreover, relying on recent computer vision and AI development, few companies have launched the so-called AI dashcam that can alert drivers to near-risk accidents (e.g.., following distance detection, forward collision warning), forwarding to improving driver's safety. However, even though dashcam videos create a driver's travel log (i.e., traveling diary), little research focuses on creating a valuable and friendly tool to find any incident or event with few described sketches by users. Besides, most incident detection models have been built using a traditional supervised learning approach (i.e., collecting and labeling data for a new incident class). That prevents the quick and customized development of a new incident class. Inspired from these observations, we introduce an interactive incident detection and retrieval system for first-view travel-log data, namely MM-trafficEvent, that can (1) online defined-incident detection, (2) offline fine-grained incident retrieval for both defined and undefined incidents, (3) offline automatically new incident class creating using user's queries. Moreover, the system gives promising results when being evaluated on several public datasets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dashcam; Incident Detection And Retrieval; Intelligent Cross-data Retrieval; Interactive Searching; Travel Log; Safety Engineering; Traffic Control; Dashcam; Data Retrieval; Incident Detection; Incident Detection And Retrieval; Intelligent Cross-data Retrieval; Interactive Searching; Log Data; Offline; Retrieval Systems; Travel Log; Search Engines","Safety engineering; Traffic control; Dashcam; Data retrieval; Incident detection; Incident detection and retrieval; Intelligent cross-data retrieval; Interactive searching; Log data; Offline; Retrieval systems; Travel log; Search engines","","","This research is conducted under the Collaborative Research Agreement between National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Japan and University of Science, Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.","Xu, Yiming, Intelligent Transportation System and Future of Road Safety, pp. 209-214, (2019); Dfrws Apac, (2021); Kim, Joohyun, Dashcam Witness: Video Sharing Motives and Privacy Concerns across Different Nations, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 110425-110437, (2020); Evans, Jonny, Evolution and Future of Urban Road Incident Detection Algorithms, Journal of Transportation Engineering Part A: Systems, 146, 6, (2020); Int Conf on Innovations in Science and Education Cbu, (2020); Bazilinskyy, Pavlo, Risk perception: A study using dashcam videos and participants from different world regions, Traffic Injury Prevention, 21, 6, pp. 347-353, (2020); Hireche, Samia, A Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques used for Urban Automatic Incident Detection Systems, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 281-286, (2020); Proceedings of the 28th Conference of Fruct Association Moscow Russia, (2021); Hsu, Hao Hsuan, Collision Analysis to Motor Dashcam Videos with YOLO and Mask R-CNN for Auto Insurance, pp. 311-315, (2020); Unsupervised Traffic Accident Detection in First Person Videos, (2019)","Chen, Y.; Ludwig, H.; Tu, Y.; Fayyad, U.; Zhu, X.; Hu, X.T.; Byna, S.; Liu, X.; Zhang, J.; Pan, S.; Papalexakis, V.; Wang, J.; Cuzzocrea, A.; Ordonez, C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ankura Collaboration Drives Results; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; Lyve Cloud; NSF; Seagate","2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2021","","Virtual, Online","176404","","9781665439022","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125322996"

While in most of the prior arts, due to the nature of spike represented unipolar format, the B-SNN were implemented using either complex or non-regular logic that is not suited for IMC and/or makes the network inflexible. In this work, we present a B-SNN model that permits the direct adoption of a unipolar format spike on the XNOR array, i.e., allows fully exploiting IMC's potential benefit based on the highly regular and simple array structure. Also, instead of indirectly taking the B-SNN model from the trained BNN, we propose a residual model for deep B-SNN networks. The system simulation shows that our trained network achieves reasonably good accuracy (59.11%) on CIFAR-100 with very low inference latency (only 8 time-steps B-SNN). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Binary Spiking Neural Network; In-memory Computing; Residual Connection; Arts Computing; Computation Theory; Array Structures; Binary Spiking Neural Network; Computing Model; In-memory Computing; Neural Network Model; Neural-networks; Potential Benefits; Prior Arts; Residual Connection; Simple++; Neural Networks","Arts computing; Computation theory; Array structures; Binary spiking neural network; Computing model; In-memory computing; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Potential benefits; Prior arts; Residual connection; Simple++; Neural networks","","","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work supported by JST, PRESTO Grant Number JPMJPR18M7, Japan, and the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 102.01-2018.310.

The moderated mediation analysis with a bootstrapping approach was employed to analyse data for hypotheses testing. The data is from the fourth-round dataset of the High- Performance Manufacturing Project, collected from manufacturing plants worldwide. The results indicate that (1) quality information is positively associated with quality performance through process control, and (2) shop floor leadership (i.e., supervisory interaction facilitation) positively moderates the indirect effect of quality information on quality performance; that is, the shop floor leadership practice strengthens the effect of quality information on quality performance through process control. This study also has a practical implication for top managers who should consider the vital role of leadership practices adopted by shop floor supervisors in implementing total quality management practices and should raise awareness that leadership practices are not only for the 'C-suite' but also for shop floor supervisors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High-performance; Leadership; Quality Performance; Total Quality Management","","","","The authors appreciate the financial support for this research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) Number JP19H01520 and the Kamenori Foundation.","Ahire, Sanjay L., Impact of design management and process management on quality: An empirical investigation, Journal of Operations Management, 18, 5, pp. 549-575, (2000); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Baird, Kevin M., The relationships between organizational culture, total quality management practices and operational performance, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 31, 7, pp. 789-814, (2011); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

To analyze caching systems, besides mathematical models, there are simulation-based methods, which are based on virtual environments to mimic the system behaviors, typically, such as CDN simulators and testbeds. But these simulators and testbeds have their limitations. In particular, simulators cannot guarantee the functional realism of service applications. Meanwhile, testbeds are cumbersome and inflexible to adapt to new topologies or caching strategies. In this work, we develop a CDN emulator, which is adaptive, flexible, high-fidelity, and reliable. To evaluate the reproducibility of experimental results, we also run our tools multiple configuration parameter sets and compare the results with a discrete event simulation. Our experiments show that our emulator is stable and works properly. The tool's resource consumption is also evaluated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Content Delivery Network; Emulation; Mininet; Simulation; Discrete Event Simulation; Simulators; Virtual Reality; Caching System; Content Delivery Network; Emulation; Investment Costs; Mininet; Network Emulators; Network System Performance; Service Quality; Simulation; System Services; Testbeds","Discrete event simulation; Simulators; Virtual reality; Caching system; Content delivery network; Emulation; Investment costs; Mininet; Network emulators; Network system performance; Service Quality; Simulation; System services; Testbeds","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was conducted within the project of Emulation of the color-based caching scheme in Telco-CDNs with Mininet using real data sponsored by TIS (IT Holding Group).

Yet almost no research has investigated the degree to which and in what ways volitional personality change (VPC), or individuals’ active efforts toward personality change, might be common around the world. Through a custom-built website, 13,278 college student participants from 55 countries and one of a larger country (Hong Kong, S.A.R.) using 42 different languages reported whether they were currently trying to change their personality and, if so, what they were trying to change. Around the world, 60.40% of participants reported that they are currently trying to change their personalities, with the highest percentage in Thailand (81.91%) and the lowest in Kenya (21.41%). Among those who provide open-ended responses to the aspect of personality they are trying to change, the most common goals were to increase emotional stability (29.73%), conscientiousness (19.71%), extraversion (15.94%), and agreeableness (13.53%). In line with previous research, students who are trying to change any personality trait tend to have relatively low levels of emotional stability and happiness. Moreover, those with relatively low levels of socially desirable traits reported attempting to increase what they lacked.

An efficient and comprehensive air quality monitoring system may reduce the harmfulness and improve the cities' sustainability. This paper presents a novel approach to realize such a system in which the air monitoring sensors are mobile. More specifically, we introduce a three-tier architecture for the air quality system, including sensing, communication, and application layers. Initially, we discuss each layer concept to bypass the limitation of the traditional stationary monitoring system. We then describe our design and implementation of air quality monitoring devices installed on vehicles, such as buses. The device is carefully designed to satisfy the conditions of impedance matching and power integrity. Besides, it fully functions in measuring parameters from the ambient environment. The device is aware of its location (using GPS) and uses Wi-Fi and 4G (LTE) to transmit sensing data on the Internet. We have conducted various experiments, including a trial deployment of the devices on a vehicle running in Hanoi. The results show our device achieves sensing data transmission with high-reliability levels (i.e., 97%, 100% on Wi-Fi, 4G (LTE), respectively). Moreover, the trial deployment confirms the feasible operation of our device in actual condition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Monitoring; Architecture; Fi-mi; Hardware; Air Quality; Architecture; Client Server Computer Systems; Computer Architecture; Developing Countries; Sustainable Development; Wireless Local Area Networks (wlan); Air Monitoring; Air Quality Monitoring; Architectural Concepts; Critical Issues; Fi-mi; Hardware; Monitoring Sensors; Quality Monitoring System; Sensing Data; Viet Nam; Monitoring","Air quality; Architecture; Client server computer systems; Computer architecture; Developing countries; Sustainable development; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Air monitoring; Air quality monitoring; Architectural concepts; Critical issues; Fi-mi; Hardware; Monitoring sensors; Quality monitoring system; Sensing data; Viet Nam; Monitoring","","","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was funded by Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup JSC), Vingroup and supported by Vin-group Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under project code VINIF.2020.DA09.; Funding text 2: This work was funded by Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup JSC), Vingroup and supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under project code VINIF.2020.DA09.","Hien, Pham Duy, Concentrations of NO2, SO2, and benzene across Hanoi measured by passive diffusion samplers, Atmospheric Environment, 88, pp. 66-73, (2014); Ambient Air Pollution A Global Assessment of Exposure and Burden of Disease, (2018); undefined, (2021); Gu, Qijun, A Consumer UAV-based Air Quality Monitoring System for Smart Cities, (2019); Yang, Yuzhe, AQNet: Fine-grained 3D spatio-temporal air quality monitoring by aerial-ground WSN, pp. 1-2, (2018); Hu, Zhiwen, UAV Aided Aerial-Ground IoT for Air Quality Sensing in Smart City: Architecture, Technologies, and Implementation, IEEE Network, 33, 2, pp. 14-22, (2019); Villa, Tommaso Francesco, Development and validation of a UAV based system for air pollution measurements, Sensors, 16, 12, (2016); Fi Mi A Fine Grained AI Based Mobile Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting System, (2021); Nguyen, Viet Dung, An e-1/2e-1-Approximation Algorithm for Maximizing Coverage Capability in Mobile Air Quality Monitoring Systems, (2020); Nguyen, Viet Dung, A 1/2-Approximation Algorithm for Target Coverage Problem in Mobile Air Quality Monitoring Systems, Proceedings - IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM, (2020)","Mansor, M.F.; Ramli, N.; Ismail, M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","26th IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications, APCC 2021","","Virtual, Kuala Lumpur","174510","","9781728172545","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120861527"

Hence, insurance companies in Vietnam will have more opportunities to increase sales and revenues for insurance services and products that connect with the increasing trend of commercial transactions and trading across border and between nations. Beside, our past researches also indicate that risk level of insurance firms will depend on many factors such as financial leverage, competitor size, tax rate, etc. We also recognized that risk of these companies might increase together with increase in tax rates, so we might suggest proper tax rates to reduce risk.

That makes even more sense in the context of the current covid 19 pandemic and increasing social distancing. It can be said that the appearance of the COVID-19 epidemic has adversely affected the economy, fundamentally changing people’s living and consumption behavior. Meanwhile, business sectors are facing the risk of production shutdown because of capital flow downturn, idle operation or bankruptcy because of covid19. The reason for social distancing forces people to not be able to travel freely to carry out travel and shopping behaviors like before. Previously normal activities were restricted from being concentrated in large places, leading to a business industry that was supposed to be super-profitable and a major contributor to a high GDP structure such as tourism, which is facing a dilemma. The tourist season is coming, but the number of tourists suddenly drops because of social distancing. That risk poses a big obstacle to the tourism industry, but it will be an opportunity if we know how to take advantage of the 4.0 technology revolution. That will help make use of smart digital technology applications to exploit and develop different types of tourism.

This research is different from the previous research since the research model integrates the expectation confirmation theory and the theory of planned behavior. Accordingly, this study contributes to the literature by creating the possibility to explore how tourist’s ecotourism loyalty and eWOM are greatly influenced by tourism experience, which aligns with previous research findings. This research will emphasize the tourist’s ecotourism satisfaction and personal behavior intentions. Therefore, this study is the first of its kind to the study’s theoretical contribution through a model to enhance understanding of tourist’s ecotourism loyalty and eWOM in Vietnam. The research findings tell us that developing entertainment services, fun learning, and emotional experience influenced tourists’ ecotourism loyalty and eWOM in Vietnam.

Among economic sectors, tourism is a very important industry that contributes greatly to GDP growth of the country in the current context. Forecasting tourism revenue is very important to have reasonable policies or decisions at the macro level. In fact, in this period, with new concepts of smart cities and smart communities, we experienced IoTs (internet of things) roles in developing and promoting our local and community tourism services very much. In the current context, digital transformation is an inevitable development trend. Currently, businesses that do not follow this trend will not be able to access new achievements and advancements and will find it difficult to participate in the new value chain that digital transformation brings. The article uses the method of analyzing and forecasting tourism industry revenue. This paper proposes a solution to apply an analysis and forecasting method through linear regression to forecast tourism revenue. To implement this method, the article collects and analyzes data, thereby proposing solutions to promote socio-economic development and tourism industry. The research results will play an important role, helping policymakers to be proactive in making necessary plans and decisions for business, investment, and promotion processes of travel to increase revenue, etc. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analysis And Forecast; Computer Skills; Digital Transformation Of The Tourism Industry; Regression; Tourism Revenue","","","","","Attaran, Mohsen, Information technology and business-process redesign, Business Process Management Journal, 9, 4, pp. 440-458, (2003); Research on Building Linkage Models in Community Based Tourism Development to Increase Income for Households in the Western Districts of Ha Giang Province, (2019); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Becker, Brian E., Strategic human resources management: Where do we go from here?, Journal of Management, 32, 6, pp. 898-925, (2006); Bell, Bradford S., The impact of e-HR on professional competence in HRM: Implications for the development of HR professionals, Human Resource Management, 45, 3, pp. 295-308, (2006); Black, Janice A., Strategic resources: Traits, configurations and paths to sustainable competitive advantage, Strategic Management Journal, 15, 2 S, pp. 131-148, (1994); Broadbent, Marianne, Strategic context and patterns of IT infrastructure capability, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 8, 2, pp. 157-187, (1999); Clemons, Eric K., Corporate Strategies for Information Technology: A Resource-Based Approach, Computer, 24, 11, pp. 23-32, (1991); Ngoc Huy, Dinh Tran, The critical analysis of limited south asian corporate governance standards after financial crisis, International Journal for Quality Research, 9, 4, pp. 741-764, (2015); Grant, Robert M., The Resource-Based Theory of Competitive Advantage: Implications for Strategy Formulation, California Management Review, 33, 3, pp. 114-135, (1991)","","Webology Center","","","","","","1735188X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119519779"

Therefore, countries in general and Vietnam are all aiming to develop the digital economy. The concept of digital transformation of the economy or development of the digital economy in Vietnam focuses on the following basic contents: 1) Developing digital businesses; 2) Digital transformation for traditional businesses (towards digitally integrated products; transforming business models on digital platforms; changing production processes based on digital data, automation, virtualization, etc.); 3) Development of digital finance; 4) E-commerce development. Therefore, digital transformation becomes an inevitable and objective trend, supporting banks to overcome challenges, create competitive advantages, and actively adapt to the context of digital transformation. In the context of the development of the digital economy in Vietnam is taking place strongly across industries and fields, requiring banks in Vietnam to have a transformation to a new business model. In this business model, it is necessary to integrate technology in operations and digitize business processes in the direction of automation and intelligence. Thereby, banks can perform activities of providing products and services on digital platforms, effectively exploiting data, thereby increasing experiences in business resolution and customer engagement. Besides, Internet of things has connect everything through internet, therefore risk management information system of Vietnam banks is also affected by IoTs and reliable internet data can help to enhance better RMIS in commercial banks.

This paper also analyze Vingroup accounting net profit under effects from Digital transformation and Internet of things (IoTs) in industry 4.0. In reality, computer skills and models allow us to build a OLS regression equation to estimate accounting net profit under impacts from internal factors of the real estate firm, Vingroup. Digital transformation and computer research models allow scientists to build a OLS regression model with Eview software to estimate effects of above cost and revenue factors on Vingroup accounting net profit.

An autoencoder architecture based on the reconstruction error using a log-Mel spectrogram feature is a conventional approach for this domain. However, because of the non-stationary nature of some sounds from the target machine, such a conventional approach does not perform well in those circumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel approach regarding the choice of used features and a new auto-encoder architecture. We created the Mixed Feature, which is a mixture of different sound representations, and a new deep learning method called Fully-Connected U-Net, a form of autoencoder architecture. With experiments on the same dataset as the baseline system, using the same architecture for all types of machines, the experimental results showed that our methods outperformed the baseline system in terms of the AUC and pAUC evaluation metrics. The optimized model achieved 83.38% AUC and 64.51% pAUC on average overall machine types on the developed dataset and outperformed the published baseline by 13.43% AUC and 8.13% pAUC. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomalous Sound; Anomaly Detection; Auto-encoder; Spectrogram; U-net","","","","This work was supported by FPT Software AI Committee, FPT Software Company Limited, Hanoi, Vietnam.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were obtained from a survey of 552 employees of four companies in Japan and analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings: The results show that state anxiety has a significantly positive effect on rule adherence and kaizen performance. Trait anxiety positively influences employees' initiative and perseverance but has a significant negative effect on kaizen performance. Originality/value: This study contributes to kaizen and continuous improvement theory by focussing on individual kaizen, which is considered to be as important as organisation-level kaizen and investigating the relevance of personal anxiety in individual kaizen behaviours and kaizen performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioural Operations; Continuous Improvement; Individual Kaizen; Personal Anxiety; Suggestion System","","","","This research has been generously funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Grant KAKENHI [20K01878].

A simple spectrometric system is practical in principle, but its manufacturability and reproducibility were somehow limited in the previous studies because they were based on discrete components such as filters or LEDs. High manufacturability and reproducibility of our developed system were already reported, but the performance of sweetness grading was not examined. In this study, the best performance of 91.3% accuracy and 91.5% precision was obtained from a discriminant analysis (DA) model that was trained with the spectral response of apple at five wavebands (535, 680, 730, 760, and 900 nm) selected with a sequential forward selection (SFS) algorithm. The performance level was superior to that of the previous studies on their simple spectrometric systems.

This study aimed to describe the general characteristics and high-risk behaviors of PNDWH and identify associated factors for adopting high-risk behaviors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Vietnam to explore the high-risk behaviors of 506 PNDWH. Associated factors were identified using multivariable logistic regressions. 83.2% of participants had sex without using a condom, and 27.9% had more than two sex partners. Among injected drug users, 44% had shared needles with an average number of 2.1 shared partners. Male, Kinh ethnicity (Vietnamese), high income, and high educational level were risk factors for high-risk behaviors. Our findings revealed the first time a comprehensive picture of PNDWH and emphasized the high prevalence of STIs, including untreated STIs and the long delay since the early HIV diagnosis.

This problem has become one of the interesting research subjects for many years, and there are many applications developed for personal usages. In this work, we aim to investigate a multi-source machine learning approach to approximate the local AQI scores at users' location in a big city. We conduct different experiments on three primary data sets: ""SEPHLA-MediaEval 2019"", ""MNR-Air-HCM,""and ""MNR-HCM,""collected in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) and Fukuoka city (Japan). From the data sets provided, we extract different types of useful attributes for the problem: the timestamp information, the geographical data, sensor data (humidity and temperature), users' emotion tags (such as greenness, calmness, etc.), the semantic features from images captured by users as well as the public weather data (including temperature, dew point, humidity, wind speed, and pressure) of the related cities. After that, we compare five distinct machine learning models for estimating the local AQI score and level, including Support Vector Machine [1], Random Forest [2], Extreme Gradient Boosting [3], LightGBM [4] and CatBoost [5]. We use RMSE, MAE, and R2 for measuring the performance of these approaches. The experimental results show that using random forest with sensor data, combined with public weather data, the results in AQI values regression and AQI ranks prediction can be the highest in many cases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aqi Estimation; Catboost; Extreme Gradient Boosting; Lightgbm; Random Forest; Adaptive Boosting; Big Data; Decision Trees; Meteorology; Random Forests; Semantics; Support Vector Machines; Wind; Geographical Data; Gradient Boosting; Humidity And Temperatures; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine Learning Models; Multi-sources; Research Subjects; Semantic Features; Learning Systems","Adaptive boosting; Big data; Decision trees; Meteorology; Random forests; Semantics; Support vector machines; Wind; Geographical data; Gradient boosting; Humidity and temperatures; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Multi-Sources; Research subjects; Semantic features; Learning systems","","","","Cortes, Corinna, Support-Vector Networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Ho, Tin Kam, Random decision forests, Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR, 1, pp. 278-282, (1995); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); MacHado, Marcos Roberto, LightGBM: An effective decision tree gradient boosting method to predict customer loyalty in the finance industry, pp. 1111-1116, (2019); Ostroumova Prokhorenkova, Liudmila Ostroumova, Catboost: Unbiased boosting with categorical features, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2018-December, pp. 6638-6648, (2018); Zhu, Dixian, A machine learning approach for air quality prediction: Model regularization and optimization, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 2, 1, pp. 1-15, (2018); Atmosphere, (2019); Zhang, Qiang, A deep learning and image-based model for air quality estimation, Science of the Total Environment, 724, (2020); Applying Machine Learning Techniques on Air Quality Data for Real Time Decision Support, (2003); Masih, Adven, Machine learning algorithms in air quality modeling, Global Journal of Environmental Science and Management, 5, 4, pp. 515-534, (2019)","Wu, X.; Jermaine, C.; Xiong, L.; Hu, X.T.; Kotevska, O.; Lu, S.; Xu, W.; Aluru, S.; Zhai, C.; Al-Masri, E.; Chen, Z.; Saltz, J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ankura TM; IBM; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society","8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2020","","Virtual, Atlanta; GA","168025","","9781728162515","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103837251"

It poses many risks to commuters like traffic accidents, especially during bad weather situations. Besides, owing to the exponential growth of IoT technologies, it is easier than ever to collect a huge amount of urban sensing data. Therefore, building a system to anticipate congestion from the collected data could enhance public safety and give traffic police forces enough time to handle traffic flows in potentially dangerous areas. Moreover, if we can discover patterns in which predicted congestion usually happens, we can build reaction plans with various alert codes. They create dynamic risk maps that can provide useful knowledge to both authorities and travelers to make rescue and travel plans effectively. This paper proposes a novel framework to address these problems. The proposed framework employs the Enhanced-Fusion-3DCNN deep learning model to predict future long-term traffic congestion on a particular mesh-code at a particular time instance. The predicted traffic congestion data is later transformed into a temporal database and feed to the maximal periodic-frequent pattern algorithm to identify the sets of mesh-code in which regular congestion may happen in the predicted data. Experimental results on real-world traffic congestion data demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Geospatial Visualization; Multi-modal Prediction; Periodic-frequent Patterns; Traffic Congestion; Big Data; Deep Learning; Maps; Mesh Generation; Urban Growth; Dangerous Area; Dynamic Risks; Exponential Growth; Learning Models; Police Forces; Temporal Database; Time Instances; Traffic Situations; Traffic Congestion","Big data; Deep learning; Maps; Mesh generation; Urban growth; Dangerous area; Dynamic risks; Exponential growth; Learning models; Police forces; Temporal Database; Time instances; Traffic situations; Traffic congestion","","","","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, (2020); Alkouz, Balsam, SNSJam: Road traffic analysis and prediction by fusing data from multiple social networks, Information Processing and Management, 57, 1, (2020); Chou, Chihhsin, Long-term traffic time prediction using deep learning with integration of weather effect, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11440 LNAI, pp. 123-135, (2019); Yu, Rose, Deep learning: A generic approach for extreme condition traffic forecasting, pp. 777-785, (2017); Xie, Dongfan, A Spatiotemporal Apriori Approach to Capture Dynamic Associations of Regional Traffic Congestion, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 3695-3709, (2020); Zheng, Yuxin, Plstm: Long short-term memory neural networks for propagatable traffic congested states prediction, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1107 AISC, pp. 399-406, (2020); Sigspatial Special, (2018); IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (2020); Dao, Minhson Son, Insights from Urban Sensing Data: From Chaos to Predicted Congestion Patterns, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW, 2020-November, pp. 661-668, (2020); Dao, Minhson Son, Complex Event Analysis of Urban Environmental Data based on Deep CNN of Spatiotemporal Raster Images, pp. 2160-2169, (2018)","Wu, X.; Jermaine, C.; Xiong, L.; Hu, X.T.; Kotevska, O.; Lu, S.; Xu, W.; Aluru, S.; Zhai, C.; Al-Masri, E.; Chen, Z.; Saltz, J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ankura TM; IBM; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society","8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2020","","Virtual, Atlanta; GA","168025","","9781728162515","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103828853"

It can lead to several health problems such as somnolence, poorer daytime cognitive performance, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools play a very important role in the detection of breathing disorders. It is possible to measure breathing activity, but most approaches require some type of device placed on the human body. This paper proposes a novel methodology of an unobtrusive CAD system to the breathing disorder detection. Unobtrusive approach is ensured by ballistocardiography (BCG) sensors located on the measured bed. The significant pieces of information from the signals are extracted by Cartan curvatures. Thereafter, important features are separated from individual samples as an input to our 9-layer deep convolutional neural network.

To address this issue, we utilize a local strategy to accelerate a sequence of neighborhood-based granulation induced by Gaussian kernel function. Subsequently, local three-way decision rules are investigated based on the Bayesian minimum risk criterion. Moreover, by the construction of a novel local trisection model, we propose a local sequential approach of three-way granular computing under a temporal-spatial multilevel granular structure. Finally, a series of comparative experiments between global and local perspectives is carried out to verify the effectiveness of our proposed models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Local Neighborhood; Multi-granularity; Sequential Three-way Decision; Temporal-spatial; Three-way Granular Computing; Decision Making; Comparative Experiments; Decision Process; Gaussian Kernel Functions; Granular Structuress; Hierarchical Multilevel; Local Perspective; Multi-granularity; Sequential Approach; Granular Computing","Decision making; Comparative experiments; Decision process; Gaussian kernel functions; Granular structuress; Hierarchical multilevel; Local perspective; Multi-granularity; Sequential approach; Granular computing","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61773324, 61876157, 61976182), the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 20YJC630191), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. JBK2001004), the Fintech Innovation Center of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, and the Financial Intelligence & Financial Engineering Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province.","Ciucci, Davide E., Synergy of Granular Computing, Shadowed Sets, and Three-way Decisions, Information Sciences, 508, pp. 422-425, (2020); Deng, Xiaofei, A Multifaceted Analysis of Probabilistic Three-way Decisions, Fundamenta Informaticae, 132, 3, pp. 291-313, (2014); Fang, Yu, Granularity-driven sequential three-way decisions: A cost-sensitive approach to classification, Information Sciences, 507, pp. 644-664, (2020); Fujita, Hamido, Resilience analysis of critical infrastructures: A cognitive approach based on granular computing, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 5, pp. 1835-1848, (2019); Guo, Yanting, Local logical disjunction double-quantitative rough sets, Information Sciences, 500, pp. 87-112, (2019); Hu, Qinghua, Neighborhood classifiers, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 866-876, (2008); Hu, Qinghua, Gaussian kernel based fuzzy rough sets: Model, uncertainty measures and applications, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 51, 4, pp. 453-471, (2010); Jia, Xiuyi, A multiphase cost-sensitive learning method based on the multiclass three-way decision-theoretic rough set model, Information Sciences, 485, pp. 248-262, (2019); Ju, Hengrong, Sequential three-way classifier with justifiable granularity, Knowledge-Based Systems, 163, pp. 103-119, (2019); Li, Huaxiong, Sequential three-way decision and granulation for cost-sensitive face recognition, Knowledge-Based Systems, 91, pp. 241-251, (2016)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087588393"

Method: Data were collected from participants in 62 countries (N = 15,318), recruited from universities by local collaborators to complete the study via a custom-built website using 42 languages. Results: Several findings of the previous study were replicated. The average reported situational experience around the world was mildly positive. The same countries tended to be most alike in reported situational experience (r =.60) across the two studies, among the countries included in both. As in the previous study, the homogeneity of reported situational experience was significantly greater within than between countries, although the difference was small. The previously reported exploratory finding that negative aspects of situations varied more across countries than positive aspects did not replicate. Correlations between aspects of reported situational experience and country-level average value scores, personality, and demographic variables were largely similar between the two studies. Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of cross-cultural situational research and the need to replicate its results, and highlight the complex interplay of culture and situational experience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Demography; Human; Human Experiment; Language; Major Clinical Study; Personality; Cultural Anthropology; Questionnaire; University; Culture; Humans; Personality; Surveys And Questionnaires; Universities","adult; article; demography; human; human experiment; language; major clinical study; personality; cultural anthropology; questionnaire; university; Culture; Humans; Personality; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities","","","Funding text 1: The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: the research was supported by the US National Science Foundation under Grant BCS\u20101528131.

In this study of Vietnamese folktales, through the use of Bayesian multilevel modeling and the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we offer empirical evidence for how the interplay between religious teachings (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) and deviant behaviors (lying and violence) could affect a folktale’s outcome. The findings indicate that characters who lie and/or commit violent acts tend to have bad endings, as intuition would dictate, but when they are associated with any of the above Three Teachings, the final endings may vary. Positive outcomes are seen in cases where characters associated with Confucianism lie and characters associated with Buddhism act violently. The results supplement the worldwide literature on discrepancies between folklore and real-life conduct, as well as on the contradictory human behaviors vis-à-vis religious teachings. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of human decision-making, especially beyond the folklore realm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abello, James, Computational folkloristics, Communications of the ACM, 55, 7, pp. 60-70, (2012); Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, (1977); Revista Alicantina De Estudios Ingleses, (2010); Int J Stud Engl Lang Lit, (2014); Atran, Scott, The devoted actor: Unconditional commitment and intractable conflict across cultures, Current Anthropology, 57, pp. S192-S203, (2016); Journal of American Folklore, (1954); Benda, Brent B., Religion and violent offenders in boot camp: A structural equation model, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 39, 1, pp. 91-121, (2002); Bersoff, David M., Why good people sometimes do bad things: Motivated reasoning and unethical behavior, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, 1, pp. 28-39, (1999); Bi, Lijun, The doctrine of filial piety: A philosophical analysis of the concealment case, Journal of Chinese Philosophy, 31, 4, pp. 451-467, (2004); Blogowska, Joanna, Religious prosociality and aggression: It's real, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 52, 3, pp. 524-536, (2013)","","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

The effectiveness of deep learning models depends largely on the amount of data being used to train the model. However, these data are often private or sensitive, which make it challenging to collect and apply deep learning models in practice. In this paper, we introduce an anonymous deep neural network training protocol called ATP (Anonymous Training Protocol), in which each party owns a private dataset and collectively trains a global model without any data leakage to other parties. To achieve this, we use the technique of sharing random gradients with large aggregate mini-batch sizes combined with the addition of temporary random noise. These random noises will then be sent back through an anonymous network to be filtered out during the update phase of the aggregate server. The proposed ATP model allows protection of the shared gradients even when the aggregating server colludes with other n-2 participants. We evaluate the model on the MNIST dataset with the CNN network architecture, resulting in an accuracy of 98.09%. The results show that the proposed ATP model has high practical applicability in protecting privacy in deep learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Distributed Computing; Information Privacy; Aggregates; Deep Neural Networks; Learning Systems; Network Architecture; Privacy By Design; Anonymous Networks; Anonymous Protocol; Effective Approaches; Global Modeling; Large Aggregates; Neural Network Training; Privacy Preserving; Real-world Problem; Deep Learning","Aggregates; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Network architecture; Privacy by design; Anonymous Networks; Anonymous protocol; Effective approaches; Global modeling; Large aggregates; Neural network training; Privacy preserving; Real-world problem; Deep learning","","","","Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2, pp. 1097-1105, (2012); Habibi, Maryam, Deep learning with word embeddings improves biomedical named entity recognition, Bioinformatics, 33, 14, pp. i37-i48, (2017); Liu, Weibo, A survey of deep neural network architectures and their applications, Neurocomputing, 234, pp. 11-26, (2017); McMahan, H.

We further pre-train the original BERT model on a Vietnamese legal domain-specific corpus and achieve a higher F1-Score than the original BERT at 90.6% on the same task, which could reveal the potential of a new pre-trained language model in the legal area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Answer Selection; Language Model; Legal Document; Natural Language Processing; Question Answering; Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; F1 Scores; Fine Tuning; Language Model; Legal Domains; Legal Questions; Nlp (natural Language Processing); Question Answering Systems; Vietnamese; Natural Language Processing Systems","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; F1 scores; Fine tuning; Language model; Legal domains; Legal questions; Nlp (natural language processing); Question answering systems; Vietnamese; Natural language processing systems","","","This research is funded by the University of Science, VNU-HCM under grant number CNTT 2020-14.","Devlin, Jacob, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Nguyen, Dai Quoc, A Vietnamese question answering system, pp. 26-32, (2009); IFIP International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management, (2016); Bas an Answer Selection Method Using Bert Language Model, (2019); Mikolov, Tomáš, Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space, (2013); Mikolov, Tomáš, Distributed representations ofwords and phrases and their compositionality, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2013); Peters, Matthew E., Deep contextualized word representations, 1, pp. 2227-2237, (2018); Xlnet Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding, (2019); Beltagy, Iz, SCIBERT: A pretrained language model for scientific text, pp. 3615-3620, (2019); Lee, Jinhyuk, BioBERT: A pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining, Bioinformatics, 36, 4, pp. 1234-1240, (2020)","Bao, V.N.Q.; Van Vu, N.; Triet, T.M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Communications Society Vietnam Chapter (ComSoc); University of Science; Vietnam's National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)","7th NAFOSTED Conference on Information and Computer Science, NICS 2020","","Ho Chi Minh City","166917","","9780738105536","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101137199"

The first distinct point of this work is designing the MC's charging algorithm under the consideration of target coverage and connectivity. As a solution, we introduce a novel on-demand charging scheme for WRSNs that optimize the charging time at each MC's charging location. Moreover, we take advantage of the Q-learning technique (i.e., hence named our algorithms Q-charging) to maximize the number of monitored targets. Q-charging can prioritize the sensor nodes, which play a more critical role in the network. Hence, Q-charging can select a suitable charging location aiming to provide sufficient power for the prioritized sensors. We have evaluated our proposal in comparison to the previous works. The evaluation results show that Q-charging can prolong the time until the first target is not monitored by 5.2 times on the average, and 14.3 times in the best case, compared to existing algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Connectivity; On-demand Charging Algorithm; Q-learning; Target Coverage; Wrsn; Learning Algorithms; Charging Algorithm; Charging Strategies; Connectivity; On Demands; On-demand Charging Algorithm; Power; Q-learning; Rechargeable Sensor Networks; Target Coverage; Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Network; Sensor Nodes","Learning algorithms; Charging algorithm; Charging strategies; Connectivity; On demands; On-demand charging algorithm; Power; Q-learning; Rechargeable sensor networks; Target coverage; Wireless rechargeable sensor network; Sensor nodes","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was funded by Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup JSC), Vingroup and supported by Vin-group Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under project code VINIF.2020.DA09.","IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, (2017); Ojha, Tamoghna, Wireless sensor networks for agriculture: The state-of-the-art in practice and future challenges, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 118, pp. 66-84, (2015); Nguyen, Phile, TELPAC: A time and energy efficient protocol for locating and patching coverage holes in WSNs, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 147, (2019); Nguyen, Phile, Load balanced and constant stretch routing in the vicinity of holes in WSNs, 2018-January, pp. 1-6, (2018); Hanh, Nguyen Thi, Node placement for target coverage and network connectivity in WSNs with multiple sinks, 2018-January, pp. 1-6, (2018); Lyu, Zengwei, Periodic charging planning for a mobile WCE in wireless rechargeable sensor networks based on hybrid PSO and GA algorithm, Applied Soft Computing, 75, pp. 388-403, (2019); Jiang, Guiyuan, Joint charging tour planning and depot positioning for wireless sensor networks using mobile chargers, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 25, 4, pp. 2250-2266, (2017); Ma, Yu, Charging Utility Maximization in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks by Charging Multiple Sensors Simultaneously, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 26, 4, pp. 1591-1604, (2018); Xu, Wenzheng, Minimizing the longest charge delay of multiple mobile chargers for wireless rechargeable sensor networks by charging multiple sensors simultaneously, Proceedings - International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, 2019-July, pp. 881-890, (2019); Lin, Chi, Minimizing Charging Delay for Directional Charging in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2019-April, pp. 1819-1827, (2019)","Gkoulalas-Divanis, A.; Marchetti, M.; Avresky, D.R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Distributed Processing (TCDP); IEEE Computers Society","19th IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications, NCA 2020","","Cambridge; MA","166345","","9781728183268","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099729603"

An experimental approach using an advanced X-ray visualization system was employed to clarify this relationship. The results indicated that two large eddies are produced in the weld pool. One exhibits an upward tendency (upper eddy) and the other a downward tendency (lower eddy). The relative strength of each eddy significantly changed depending on the welding current through the change in the keyhole profile (shape and size). For a suitable welding current, the lower eddy was larger and much longer than the upper eddy. Virtually no welding defects were found out in the cross-section and longitudinal sections of the weld pool and keyhole. In the case of low current, the upper eddy was larger and longer than the lower eddy. Severe undercut and humping phenomena were observed on the top side. Contrarily, for a high welding current, the upper eddy disappeared to only form a significantly large lower eddy that covered the entire weld pool. Here, a severe concave defect on the top surface and a severe burn-through defect on the bottom side of the weld bead were seen. These results indicated that when the penetration ability of an arc on the base metal is sufficient, the relative strength of each eddy should be adjusted to a suitable scale with a larger downward eddy and smaller upward eddy. This can ensure a stable and high welding quality without welding defects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eddy; Heat Transportation; Plasma Keyhole Arc Welding; Welding Defects; X-ray Observation System; Welds; Experimental Approaches; Formation Process; Longitudinal Section; Penetration Ability; Relative Strength; Visualization System; Welding Current; Welding Quality; Electric Welding","Welds; Experimental approaches; Formation process; Longitudinal section; Penetration ability; Relative strength; Visualization system; Welding current; Welding quality; Electric welding","","","","Advanced Welding Processes, (1992); Liu, Zuming, Plasma arc welding: Process variants and its recent developments of sensing, controlling and modeling, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 23, pp. 315-327, (2016); Tanaka, Manabu, A study of thermal pinch effect of welding arcs, Yosetsu Gakkai Ronbunshu/Quarterly Journal of the Japan Welding Society, 25, 2, pp. 336-342, (2007); Martikainen, Jukka K., Conditions for achieving high-quality welds in the plasma-arc keyhole welding of structural steels, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 52, 1, pp. 68-75, (1995); Jia, Chuanbao, Sensing controlled pulse key-holing condition in plasma arc welding, Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China (English Edition), 19, 2, pp. 341-346, (2009); Méndez, Patricio Fernando, Welding processes for aeronautics, Advanced Materials and Processes, 159, 5, pp. 39-43, (2001); Welding Journal, (1992); Taban, Emel, Plasma arc welding of modified 12% Cr stainless steel, Materials and Manufacturing Processes, 24, 6, pp. 649-656, (2009); Metcalfe, J.

To meet this challenge, adaptive stock trading strategies with deep reinforcement learning methods are proposed. For the time-series nature of stock market data, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is applied to extract informative financial features, which can represent the intrinsic characteristics of the stock market for adaptive trading decisions. Furthermore, with the tailored design of state and action spaces, two trading strategies with reinforcement learning methods are proposed as GDQN (Gated Deep Q-learning trading strategy) and GDPG (Gated Deterministic Policy Gradient trading strategy). To verify the robustness and effectiveness of GDQN and GDPG, they are tested both in the trending and in the volatile stock market from different countries. Experimental results show that the proposed GDQN and GDPG not only outperform the Turtle trading strategy but also achieve more stable returns than a state-of-the-art direct reinforcement learning method, DRL trading strategy, in the volatile stock market. As far as the GDQN and the GDPG are compared, experimental results demonstrate that the GDPG with an actor-critic framework is more stable than the GDQN with a critic-only framework in the ever-evolving stock market. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient; Deep Q-learning; Gated Recurrent Unit; Stock Trading Strategy; Commerce; Financial Markets; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Reinforcement Learning; Dynamical Properties; Financial Industry; Financial Practitioners; Intrinsic Characteristics; Market Condition; Reinforcement Learning Method; State Of The Art; Trading Strategies; Deep Learning","Commerce; Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Dynamical properties; Financial industry; Financial practitioners; Intrinsic characteristics; Market condition; Reinforcement learning method; State of the art; Trading strategies; Deep learning","","","This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2019YFE0190500 and by the State Key Program of National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61936001).","Deep Speech 2 End to End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin, (2015); Bao, Wei, A deep learning framework for financial time series using stacked autoencoders and long-short term memory, PLOS ONE, 12, 7, (2017); Carapuço, João, Reinforcement learning applied to Forex trading, Applied Soft Computing, 73, pp. 783-794, (2018); Che, Zhengping, Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing Values, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Chinchali, Sandeep P., Cellular network traffic scheduling with deep reinforcement learning, pp. 766-774, (2018); Deng, Yue, Deep Direct Reinforcement Learning for Financial Signal Representation and Trading, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 28, 3, pp. 653-664, (2017); Deng, Yue, Sparse Coding-Inspired Optimal Trading System for HFT Industry, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 11, 2, pp. 467-475, (2015); Fischer, Thomas Günter, Deep learning with long short-term memory networks for financial market predictions, European Journal of Operational Research, 270, 2, pp. 654-669, (2018); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); Huang, Boming, Automated trading systems statistical and machine learning methods and hardware implementation: a survey, Enterprise Information Systems, 13, 1, pp. 132-144, (2019)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086798080"

As a typical representation of three-way granular computing, sequential three-way decision focuses on making a multiple stages of decisions by a sequence of trisecting-acting-outcome (TAO) models. To construct more general granules, levels, and hierarchies, we investigate an integrative multi-granularity approach to sequential three-way decision in a neighborhood system by the evolution mechanism of data and parameters. We employ the γ-cut similarity neighborhood relation based on Gaussian kernel function to the hierarchical granulation of universe. Subsequently, we propose the multilevel neighborhood granular structures by the combinations of horizontal granularity and vertical granularity, and discuss the monotonicity of level measurements associated with the uncertainty of decision. Based on such a neighborhood structured approach, a multilevel framework of sequential three-way decision is examined from coarser to finer concerning the granularity of neighborhood information. Finally, we report a series of experiments to demonstrate the performance of proposed models and algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multilevel; Neighborhood; Sequential Three-way Decision; Three-way Granular Computing; Granulation; Uncertainty Analysis; Evolution Mechanism; Gaussian Kernel Functions; Granular Structuress; Models And Algorithms; Neighborhood Information; Neighborhood Relation; Neighborhood Systems; Sequential Decisions; Granular Computing","Granulation; Uncertainty analysis; Evolution mechanism; Gaussian kernel functions; Granular structuress; Models and algorithms; Neighborhood information; Neighborhood relation; Neighborhood systems; Sequential decisions; Granular computing","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61773324, 61876157, 61976182), the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 20YJC630191), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. JBK2001004), the Fintech Innovation Center of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, and the Financial Intelligence & Financial Engineering Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province.","Ciucci, Davide E., Synergy of Granular Computing, Shadowed Sets, and Three-way Decisions, Information Sciences, 508, pp. 422-425, (2020); Fang, Yu, Granularity-driven sequential three-way decisions: A cost-sensitive approach to classification, Information Sciences, 507, pp. 644-664, (2020); Fujita, Hamido, Resilience analysis of critical infrastructures: A cognitive approach based on granular computing, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 5, pp. 1835-1848, (2019); Hu, Qinghua, Comments on ""Fuzzy probabilistic approximation spaces and their information measures, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 16, 2, pp. 549-551, (2008); Hu, Qinghua, Neighborhood classifiers, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 866-876, (2008); Hu, Qinghua, Gaussian kernel based fuzzy rough sets: Model, uncertainty measures and applications, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 51, 4, pp. 453-471, (2010); Hu, Qinghua, Large-Scale Multimodality Attribute Reduction with Multi-Kernel Fuzzy Rough Sets, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26, 1, pp. 226-238, (2018); Jia, Xiuyi, Three-way decisions based feature fusion for Chinese irony detection, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 113, pp. 324-335, (2019); Jia, Xiuyi, A multiphase cost-sensitive learning method based on the multiclass three-way decision-theoretic rough set model, Information Sciences, 485, pp. 248-262, (2019); Ju, Hengrong, Sequential three-way classifier with justifiable granularity, Knowledge-Based Systems, 163, pp. 103-119, (2019)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086582603"

One of the typical strategies is to reduce the number of comparisons among samples, it follows that the time consumption of generating binary relation can be saved for quickly obtaining reduct. Nevertheless, such mechanism is only designed by reducing the number of times to scan samples, which fails in reducing the iterations of evaluating attributes. To fill such gap, an acceleration strategy based on attribute group is proposed. Firstly, all of the candidate attributes are divided into different groups. Secondly, in the process of searching reduct, only the attributes out of those groups which contain at least one attribute in the potential reduct should be evaluated. It should be noticed that this is the key which can reduce the number of evaluations of candidate attributes. Finally, the above two steps are repeated until the constraint defined in attribute reduction is satisfied. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, the experiments have been conducted over three neighborhood rough set models by leveraging four measures. Compared with the existing forward greedy searching approach over 12 UCI data sets, the experimental results show that our attribute group based approach can maintain the classification performance derived by reducts while significantly accelerating the searching process of obtaining reduct. This study suggests a new trend concerning the problem of quickly computing reduct. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceleration Strategy; Attribute Group; Attribute Reduction; Rough Set; Classification (of Information); Acceleration Strategies; Attribute Reduction; Binary Relation; Classification Performance; Group-based; Neighborhood Rough Sets; Time Consumption; Rough Set Theory","Classification (of information); Acceleration strategies; Attribute reduction; Binary relation; Classification performance; Group-based; Neighborhood rough sets; Time consumption; Rough set theory","","","This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61906078 , 61572242 ), the Key Laboratory of Data Science and Intelligence Application, Fujian Province University (No. D1901), the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. KYCX19_1715).","Chen, Degang, Attribute reduction for heterogeneous data based on the combination of classical and fuzzy rough set models, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 22, 5, pp. 1325-1334, (2014); Chen, Degang, An incremental algorithm for attribute reduction with variable precision rough sets, Applied Soft Computing, 45, pp. 129-149, (2016); Dai, Jianhua, Conditional entropy for incomplete decision systems and its application in data mining, International Journal of General Systems, 41, 7, pp. 713-728, (2012); Fujita, Hamido, Resilience analysis of critical infrastructures: A cognitive approach based on granular computing, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 5, pp. 1835-1848, (2019); Hu, Qinghua, Selecting discrete and continuous features based on neighborhood decision error minimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 40, 1, pp. 137-150, (2010); Hu, Qinghua, Neighborhood rough set based heterogeneous feature subset selection, Information Sciences, 178, 18, pp. 3577-3594, (2008); Hu, Qinghua, Neighborhood classifiers, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 866-876, (2008); Jiang, Zehua, Accelerator for supervised neighborhood based attribute reduction, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 119, pp. 122-150, (2020); Jiang, Gaoxia, Markov cross-validation for time series model evaluations, Information Sciences, 375, pp. 219-233, (2017); Jiang, Zehua, Accelerator for multi-granularity attribute reduction, Knowledge-Based Systems, 177, pp. 145-158, (2019)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085272536"

All nations and communities have applied many countermeasures to control the spread of the epidemic. In terms of countermeasures, lockdowns and reductions of social activities are meant to flatten the curve of infection. Nevertheless, to date, there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods. Thus, the present study aims to interpret the change in the population density of Sapporo city in the emergency's period declaration using big data obtained from mobile spatial statistics. The results indicate that, in the time of refraining from traveling, the city's residents have been more likely to stay home and less likely to travel to the center area. This has led to a decrease of up to 90% of the population density in crowded areas. The study's outcomes partly explain the statement of reducing 70%–80% of contact between people in line with the purpose of the emergency declaration. Moreover, these findings establish the primary step for further analysis of estimating the efficiency of policy in controlling the epidemic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Data; Covid-19; Mobile Spatial Statistics; Moving Pattern; Population Concentration","","","","","J Japan Soc Civ Eng Ser D3, (2016); Beck, Matthew J., Insights into the impact of COVID-19 on household travel and activities in Australia – The early days under restrictions, Transport Policy, 96, pp. 76-93, (2020); Bucsky, Péter, Modal share changes due to COVID-19: The case of Budapest, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives, 8, (2020); Budd, Lucy C.S., Responsible Transport: A post-COVID agenda for transport policy and practice, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives, 6, (2020); undefined; undefined, (2019); de Haas, M.

In this paper, we call this type of data as multi-source hybrid data. Existed rough set models only work well with single source data or multi-source data with one type of attributes, which are not suitable for processing multi-source hybrid data. Furthermore, in dynamic data environment, multi-source hybrid data are typically evolving over time, including the addition of objects and attributes and the revision of missing values in each information source. It will result in the update of information granulation and rough approximation structures. To address these issues, we present an extended rough set model, named as multi-source composite rough sets (MCRS), by integrating different types of attributes and fusing multiple composite relations derived from different information sources. Two novel matrix operators are proposed to construct the matrix-based representation of rough approximations. Then, under the variations of objectives, attributes and attribute values in the multi-source hybrid information system, we present incremental mechanisms based on matrices for the maintenance of approximations by utilizing the previously accumulated matrices information and transmitting location information of part elements in each composite relation matrix. In addition, we develop the incremental algorithms for updating composite rough approximations. A series of comparative experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the static algorithm and other extended incremental algorithms in terms of the efficiency of computation and transmission. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Incremental Learning; Matrix Operators; Multi-source Hybrid Data; Rough Sets; Approximation Algorithms; Computational Efficiency; Information Systems; Information Use; Rough Set Theory; Comparative Experiments; Hybrid Information System; Incremental Algorithm; Information Granulation; Location Information; Matrix Based Representation; Real-life Applications; Rough Approximations; Matrix Algebra","Approximation algorithms; Computational efficiency; Information systems; Information use; Rough set theory; Comparative experiments; Hybrid information system; Incremental algorithm; Information granulation; Location information; Matrix based representation; Real-life applications; Rough approximations; Matrix algebra","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61573292, 61602327, 61603313), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Nos.

However, plant diseases have a major impact on agricultural production and economy. Conventional approach is mainly based on hand labor experiences of farmers leading to that it may have adverse consequences in preventing disease transmission. Various techniques have been applied to identify the disease in plant in order to provide solutions to the farmers as well as send them a warning signal. This paper proposes a method for plant disease identification through a set of collection of leaf images. This method is developed based on a deep convolutional autoencoder approach. Original images are firstly reconstructed by the autoencoder and then by using only encoder part, the features of these images are extracted. The output features are fed into Support Vector Machine for classification. A small set of Plant Village dataset is considered to verify the performance of the reconstructed performance by the convolutional autoencoder. Then, for the classification stage, simulation results obtained have shown that the difference of autoencoder architecture and kernels of classifier give different average accuracy. Thus, the highest accuracy reached 98.8% for plant disease classification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Autoencoder; Deep Learning; Disease Identification; Support Vector Machine; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Convolution; Learning Systems; Support Vector Machines; Agricultural Productions; Auto Encoders; Conventional Approach; Daily Lives; Disease Transmission; Original Images; Plant Disease; Warning Signals; Image Processing","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Convolution; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Agricultural productions; Auto encoders; Conventional approach; Daily lives; Disease transmission; Original images; Plant disease; Warning signals; Image processing","","","","Strange, Richard N., Plant disease: A threat to global food security, Annual Review of Phytopathology, 43, pp. 83-116, (2005); Cohen, Joel E., Human Population: The Next Half Century, Science, 302, 5648, pp. 1172-1175, (2003); Al Bashish, Dheeb, A framework for detection and classification of plant leaf and stem diseases, pp. 113-118, (2010); Sannakki, Sanjeev S., Diagnosis and classification of grape leaf diseases using neural networks, (2013); Es-saady, Youssef, Automatic recognition of plant leaves diseases based on serial combination of two SVM classifiers, pp. 561-566, (2016); Sethupathy, Jayaprakash, OpenCV based disease identification of mango leaves, International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 8, 5, pp. 1990-1998, (2016); Gavhale, Kiran R., Unhealthy region of citrus leaf detection using image processing techniques, (2014); Akhtar, Asma, Automated plant disease analysis (APDA): Performance comparison of machine learning techniques, pp. 60-65, (2013); International Journal of Research and Engineering, (2018); Sabrol, Hiteshwari, Tomato plant disease classification in digital images using classification tree, pp. 1242-1246, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","17th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2020","","Virtual, Online","162286","","9781728164861","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091870647"

In recent years, attention-based neural networks have been extensively studied in various natural language processing problems, including question answering. This paper explores match-LSTM for answer selection in cQA. A lexical gap in cQA is more challenging as questions and answers typical contain multiple sentences, irrelevant information, and noisy expressions. In our investigation, word-by-word attention in the original model does not work well on social question-answer pairs. We propose integrating supervised attention into match-LSTM. Specifically, we leverage lexical semantic from external to guide the learning of attention weights for question-answer pairs. The proposed model learns more meaningful attention that allows performing better than the basic model.

Tumor classification, however, is a typical small sample problem. In this paper, an inverse projection group sparse representation (IPGSR) model is presented for tumor classification based on constructing a low rank variation dictionary (LRVD), for short, LRVD-IPGSR model. Firstly, an IPGSR model is constructed based on making full use of existing training and test samples, and group sparsity effect of genetic data. Furthermore, from a new viewpoint, a LRVD is constructed for improving the performance of IPGSR-based tumor classification. The LRVD can be independently constructed by detecting and utilizing variations of normals and typical patients, rather than directly using and changed with the genetic data or their corresponding feature data. And the LRVD can be automatic updated and extended to fit the case of new types of diseases. Finally, the LRVD-IPGSR model is fully analyzed from feasibility, stability, optimization and convergence. The performance of the LRVD-IPGSR model-based tumor classification framework is verified on eight microarray gene expression datasets, which contain early diagnosis, tumor type recognition and postoperative metastasis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inverse Projection Group Sparse Representation; Low Rank Variation Dictionary; Microarray Gene Expression Data; Tumor Classification; Classification (of Information); Gene Expression; Inverse Problems; Tumors; Group Sparse; Group Sparsities; Inverse Projections; Microarray Gene Expression; Microarray Gene Expression Data; Sparse Representation Based Classifications; Training Sample; Tumor Classification; Computer Aided Diagnosis","Classification (of information); Gene expression; Inverse problems; Tumors; Group sparse; Group sparsities; Inverse projections; Microarray gene expression; Microarray gene expression data; Sparse representation based classifications; Training sample; Tumor classification; Computer aided diagnosis","","","The authors would like to thank https://tumorgenome.nih.gov/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS4766 for their datasets.

When USVs perform various missions in sophisticated marine environment, autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance will be necessary and essential. However, there are few effective navigation methods with real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environment. With tailored design of state and action spaces and a dueling deep Q-network, a deep reinforcement learning method ANOA (Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance) is proposed for the autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of USVs. Experimental results demonstrate that ANOA outperforms deep Q-network (DQN) and Deep Sarsa in the efficiency of exploration and the speed of convergence not only in static environment but also in dynamic environment. Furthermore, the ANOA is integrated with the real control model of a USV moving in surge, sway and yaw and it achieves a higher success rate than Recast navigation method in dynamic environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Navigation; Obstacle Avoidance; Reinforcement Learning; Unmanned Surface Vehicle (usv); Collision Avoidance; Learning Systems; Marine Navigation; Motion Planning; Reinforcement Learning; Unmanned Surface Vehicles; Autonomous Navigation; Dynamic Environments; Marine Environment; Navigation Methods; Real Time Path Planning; Reinforcement Learning Method; Speed Of Convergence; Static Environment; Deep Learning","Collision avoidance; Learning systems; Marine navigation; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned surface vehicles; Autonomous navigation; Dynamic environments; Marine environment; Navigation methods; Real time path planning; Reinforcement learning method; Speed of convergence; Static environment; Deep learning","","","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61625304 ) and by the State Key Program of National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61936001 ).","Kandath, Harikumar, Autonomous navigation and sensorless obstacle avoidance for UGV with environment information from UAV, 2018-January, pp. 266-269, (2018); Ferreira, Barbara Arbanas, Decentralized planning and control for UAV–UGV cooperative teams, Autonomous Robots, 42, 8, pp. 1601-1618, (2018); Adamski, Igor, Distributed deep reinforcement learning: Learn how to play atari games in 21 minutes, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10876 LNCS, pp. 370-388, (2018); El-Sallab, Ahmad A.Al, Deep reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving, IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology, pp. 70-76, (2017); End to End Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assist, (2016); Sharma, Hrishikesh, An efficient backtracking-based approach to turn-constrained path planning for aerial mobile robots, (2017); Guo, Qing, Path-planning of automated guided vehicle based on improved Dijkstra algorithm, pp. 7138-7143, (2017); undefined, (2018); Pérez-Carabaza, Sara, A Multi-UAV minimum time search planner based on ACOR, pp. 35-42, (2017); Phung, Manh Duong, Enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization path planning for UAV vision-based surface inspection, Automation in Construction, 81, pp. 25-33, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082456293"

An observation of the behavior of three-dimensional (3D) molten metal flow inside weld pool during welding was carried out with the support of an advanced X-ray observation system. The results showed that the metal flow in pure Ar shielding gas case was in upward direction from bottom surface toward top surface of weld pool behind the keyhole. Meanwhile, the molten metal flow in Ar shielding gas mixed with 0.5 % O<inf>2</inf> case was in downward direction from top surface toward bottom surface. The variation of convection flow inside weld pool as described above is a result of the variation of keyhole diameter and inclination angle of keyhole wall (keyhole profile) with (1) large around the top surface but narrow around the bottom surface in case of pure Ar and (2) narrow around the top surface but large around the bottom surface in case of Ar mixed with 0.5 % O<inf>2</inf>, which affect the direction and magnitude of shear force acting on weld pool surface. Consequently, only the very slight increase of oxygen content in argon shielding gas due to lowering of shielding effect is found to significantly affect material and heat transport process in PKAW. The results also imply that when argon shielding gas with small amount of oxygen is used, deep and narrow weld penetration is more easily obtained similarly with AA-TIG welding process. However, its mechanism is suggested to be mainly related to the change in shear force due to keyhole shape deformation by the decrease of the surface tension rather than the change in direction and magnitude of Marangoni force. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convection Flow; Deep Penetration; Keyhole Profile; Plasma Keyhole Arc Welding; Shear Force; X-ray Observation; Argon; Electric Arc Welding; Gas Welding; Gases; Heat Convection; Laser Beam Welding; Liquid Metals; Metals; Oxygen; Shielding; Welds; X Rays; Convection Flow; Deep Penetration; Keyhole Profile; Shear Force; X-ray Observations; Shear Flow","Argon; Electric arc welding; Gas welding; Gases; Heat convection; Laser beam welding; Liquid metals; Metals; Oxygen; Shielding; Welds; X rays; Convection flow; Deep penetration; Keyhole profile; Shear force; X-ray observations; Shear flow","","","","Tomsic, Michael J., ENERGY DISTRIBUTION IN KEYHOLE MODE PLASMA ARC WELDS., Welding Journal, 53, 3, (1974); Physics of Welding, (1986); Martikainen, Jukka K., Conditions for achieving high-quality welds in the plasma-arc keyhole welding of structural steels, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 52, 1, pp. 68-75, (1995); Welding Journal, (1991); Irving, Bob, Why aren't airplanes welded?, Welding Journal, 76, 1, pp. 31-41, (1997); Welding Journal, (1992); Liu, Zuming, Keyhole behaviors influence weld defects in plasma arc welding process, Welding Journal, 94, 9, pp. 281-290, (2015); Welding Journal, (1991); Tanaka, Manabu, Predictions of weld pool profiles using plasma physics, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 40, 1, pp. R1-R23, (2007); Zhang, Guokai, Experimental observation of both keyhole and its surrounding thermal field in plasma arc welding, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 70, pp. 439-448, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15266125","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082755985"

Moreover, we incorporate a contextual attentional correlation filter into the backbone network to make our model trainable in an end-to-end fashion.

This is a repeated cross-sectional study using data from the Vietnam Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys 2000, 2006, 2011 and 2014. We found that a slow increase was found in the trend of adequate knowledge of HIV transmission means from mother to child among women between 2000 and 2014 (41.81% in 2000, 45.66% in 2006, 49.58% in 2011, and 46.83% in 2014). Most women knew that HIV could be transmitted during pregnancy, however, more than half of women did not know all three ways of MTCT. Socioeconomic factors including age, ethnicity, education level, and economic status as factors that affected full knowledge of MTCT means. The study helps to design public health programs to raise 15-49-year-old women's knowledge in HIV transmission means from mother to child as well as can provide a quite strong case for policy adaptation to improve women's health in the time to come.

Uday, Research Organization of Information and Systems National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan","High Utility Pattern Mining is a popular task for analyzing data. It consists of discovering patterns having a high importance in databases. A popular application of high utility pattern mining is to identify high utility (profitable) patterns in customer transaction data. Though such analysis can be useful to understand data, it does not consider the cost (e.g. effort, resources, money or time) required for obtaining the utility (benefits). In this paper, we argue that to discover interesting patterns in event sequences, it is useful to consider both a utility model and a cost model. For example, to identify cost-effective ways of treating patients from medical pathways data, it is desirable to consider not only the ability of treatments to inhibit symptoms or cure a disease (utility) but also the resources consumed and the time spent (cost) to provide these treatments. Based on this perspective, this paper defines a novel task of discovering Cost-Effective Event Sequences in event logs. In this task, cost is modeled as numeric values, while utility is represented either as binary or numeric values. Measures are proposed to evaluate the trade-off and correlation between cost and utility of patterns to identify cost-effective patterns (patterns having a low cost but providing a high utility). Three efficient algorithms called CEPB, corCEPB and CEPN are designed to extract these patterns. They rely on a tight lower-bound on the cost and a memory buffering technique to find patterns efficiently. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms achieve high efficiency, that proposed optimizations improve efficiency, and that insightful cost-effective patterns are found in real-life e-learning data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cost; Cost-effective Patterns; Event Logs; Pattern Mining; Sequences; Sequential Patterns; Utility; Cost Effectiveness; Costs; Data Mining; Economic And Social Effects; Efficiency; Real Time Systems; Cost Effective; Event Logs; Pattern Mining; Sequences; Sequential Patterns; Utility; Cost Benefit Analysis","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Real time systems; Cost effective; Event logs; Pattern mining; Sequences; Sequential patterns; Utility; Cost benefit analysis","","","","Han, Jiawei, Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation: A frequent-pattern tree approach, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 8, 1, pp. 53-87, (2004); Fournier-Viger, Philippe, A survey of itemset mining, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 7, 4, (2017); Data Science and Pattern Recognition, (2017); Agrawal, Rakesh, Mining sequential patterns, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 3-14, (1995); Srikant, Ramakrishnan, Mining sequential patterns: Generalizations and performance improvements, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1057 LNCS, pp. 3-17, (1996); Zaki, Mohammed Javeed J., SPADE: An efficient algorithm for mining frequent sequences, Machine Learning, 42, 1-2, pp. 31-60, (2001); Han, Jiawei, FreeSpan: Frequent pattern-projected sequential pattern mining, pp. 355-359, (2000); Pei, Jian, Mining sequential patterns by pattern-growth: The prefixspan approach, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 16, 11, pp. 1424-1440, (2004); Fournier-Viger, Philippe, Fast vertical mining of sequential patterns using co-occurrence information, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8443 LNAI, PART 1, pp. 40-52, (2014); Fournier-Viger, Philippe, VMSP: Efficient vertical mining of maximal sequential patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8436 LNAI, pp. 83-94, (2014)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076540415"

The existing AHP frameworks developed to manage individual consistency and group consensus have been widely investigated. However, in these frameworks, the consistency is often destroyed in the consensus reaching process, which means that the revised decision makers’ judgments have little relationship to Saaty's original 1/9-9 evaluation scale. This paper outlines a new approach to aid the consensus decision making process, for which two heuristic algorithms are developed. The first algorithm is designed to assist the decision maker in achieving a predefined consistency level, and the second is designed to achieve consensus while controlling the individual consistency level. Several classical numerical examples are compared to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, some simulations are conducted to further demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for general cases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consensus; Consistency; Group Decision Making; Multiplicative Preference Relation; Simulation Analysis; Heuristic Algorithms; Heuristic Methods; Hierarchical Systems; Consensus; Consistency; Group Decision Making; Multiplicative Preference Relations; Simulation Analysis; Decision Making","Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Hierarchical systems; Consensus; Consistency; Group Decision Making; Multiplicative preference relations; Simulation analysis; Decision making","","","The authors are grateful to the editors and anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments which have lead to an improved version of this paper.

Several, literature works use cameras to record emotions. However, these approaches may not be effective in everyday life, due to camera obstructions and different types of stimulation, which can be related also with the interaction with other human beings. Therefore, in this work, it is investigated the electrocardiogram, the electrodermal activity, and the electric brain activity physiological signals as main informative channels. The aforementioned signals have been acquired through the use of a wireless wearable sensor network. An experimental methodology was proposed to induce three different emotional states by means of social interaction. Two different combinations of sensors were analyzed using three different time-window frames (180s, 150s, and 120s) and classified with three unsupervised machine learning approaches (K-Means, K-medoids and Self-organizing maps). Finally, their classification performances were compared to the ones obtained by four commonly used supervised techniques (i.e. Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and k-nearest neighbor) to discuss the optimal combination of sensors, time-window length, and unsupervised classifier. Fifteen healthy young participants were recruited in the study and more than 100 instances were analyzed.

A neuromorphic chip is based on spiking neurons that process input information only when they receive spike signals. Given a sparsely-distributed input spike train, the power consumption for such event-driven hardware would be reduced since large portions of the network that are not driven by incoming spikes can be set into a power-gated mode. The challenges that need to be solved toward building in hardware such a spiking neuromorphic chip with a massive number of synapse include building small-sized spiking neuro-cores with low-power consumption, efficient neurocoding scheme, and lightweight on-chip learning algorithm.

We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze relevant studies with findings of an association between autism spectrum disorder and breastfeeding patterns, and undertook an extensive dose-response analysis to interpret the results more accurately. Ten electronic databases and manual search of reference lists were used to identify relevant studies in September 2018. Dose-response and conventional meta-analysis were conducted by the random-effects model. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO with CRD42016043128. Seven case-control studies were found in which the association between ever breastfeeding and risk of autism spectrum disorder was investigated. We found a 58 % decrease in the risk of autism spectrum disorder with ever breastfeeding and a 76 % decrease in the risk with exclusive breastfeeding. According to our dose-response meta-analysis, breastfeeding for 6 months was associated with a 54 % reduction in the risk. In the conventional meta-analysis, breastfeeding for 12–24 months was associated with the most significant reduction in the risk of autism spectrum disorder.

It also examines whether supply and product complexity moderates the impact of internal and external process connectivity on supply chain agility. The study relies on the questionnaire survey to collect the data. Using electronic survey, the respondents working in manager' positions in Thailand's manufacturing companies are targeted. Out of 250 survey questionnaires, only 173 responses were found usable with a rate of response of 57.2%. The study focuses on Thai firms because Thai manufacturing sector is one of the strongest players in the globe. The reason to select manufacturing firms is that the manufacturing firms are considered to be very crucial in global supply chains in terms of providing agility and responsiveness while delivering final products to the consumers. Supply chain agility (SCAG) is used as dependent while internal process connectivity (INPC) and external process connectivity (EXPC) are used as independent variables. Moreover, product complexity (PRCX) and supply complexity (SPCX) are used as moderating variables. Findings show that SPCX has negatively significant influence on SCAG while PRCX has insignificant effect on SCAG. INPC and EXPC have positive and significant impact on SCAG. The results state that both INPC and EXPC play vital role in attaining SCAG. The interaction effect of product term (INPC x EXPC) on SCAG is also found to be positively significant. These outcomes are in line with the process theory which states that both INPC and EXPC are significant factor that play important role in attaining SCAG. Both these processes permit companies to better respond to continuous variations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","External Process Connectivity; Internal Process Connectivity; Product Complexity; Supply Chain Agility; Supply Complexity","","","","","Barratt, Mark A., Exploring internal and external supply chain linkages: Evidence from the field, Journal of Operations Management, 29, 5, pp. 514-528, (2011); Blome, Constantin, The impact of knowledge transfer and complexity on supply chain flexibility: A knowledge-based view, International Journal of Production Economics, 147, PART B, pp. 307-316, (2014); Bozarth, Cecil C., The impact of supply chain complexity on manufacturing plant performance, Journal of Operations Management, 27, 1, pp. 78-93, (2009); Braunscheidel, Michael J., The organizational antecedents of a firm's supply chain agility for risk mitigation and response, Journal of Operations Management, 27, 2, pp. 119-140, (2009); Chen, Haozhe, DEFINING AND OPERATIONALIZING SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESS INTEGRATION, Journal of Business Logistics, 30, 1, pp. 63-84, (2009); Choi, Thomas Y., Unveiling the structure of supply networks: Case studies in Honda, Acura, and DaimlerChrysler, Journal of Operations Management, 20, 5, pp. 469-493, (2002); Choi, Thomas Y., The supply base and its complexity: Implications for transaction costs, risks, responsiveness, and innovation, Journal of Operations Management, 24, 5, pp. 637-652, (2006); Eckstein, Dominik, The performance impact of supply chain agility and supply chain adaptability: The moderating effect of product complexity, International Journal of Production Research, 53, 10, pp. 3028-3046, (2015); Flynn, Barbara B., The impact of supply chain integration on performance: A contingency and configuration approach, Journal of Operations Management, 28, 1, pp. 58-71, (2010); Kim, Yusoon, Structural investigation of supply networks: A social network analysis approach, Journal of Operations Management, 29, 3, pp. 194-211, (2011)","","ExcelingTech excelingtech@gmail.com","","","","","","20513771; 20507399","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085286549"

Because of the complex shape changes that occur frequently in the small bowel, approaches involving human designed features and simple convolutional neural network (CNN) methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on massive datasets. To meet the challenge of assessing small bowel motility automatically, we propose the integration of deformable convolutional networks into attentive encoder–decoder. With the help of deformable convolution, a tailored CNN can track small bowel segments in different shapes from each MR image of a Cine-MRI sequence. The proposed attentive encoder–decoder performed significantly better than conventional recurrent neural network (RNN) in the assessment of small bowel motility. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only automatically assesses small bowel motility correctly, but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, it provides useful information about the physiology of small bowel motility patterns, which can be used in the diagnosis of gastroenteric diseases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attentive Encoder–decoder; Cine-mri; Deformable Convolution; Recursive Neural Networks; Small Bowel Motility; Convolution; Decoding; Deformation; Diagnosis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Signal Encoding; Cine-mri; Convolutional Networks; Convolutional Neural Network; Gastrointestinal Tract; Recurrent Neural Network (rnn); Recursive Neural Networks; Small Bowel; State-of-the-art Methods; Recurrent Neural Networks","Convolution; Decoding; Deformation; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal encoding; Cine-MRI; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Gastrointestinal tract; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Recursive neural networks; Small bowel; State-of-the-art methods; Recurrent neural networks","","","This paper is supported by the project 61303094 supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China .","Automatic Differentiation in Pytorch, (2017); Bahdanau, Dzmitry, Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, (2015); Am J Gastroenterol, (2018); Bar, Yaniv, Chest pathology identification using deep feature selection with non-medical training, Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging and Visualization, 6, 3, pp. 259-263, (2018); Beck, Eugen, Segmental encoder-decoder models for large vocabulary automatic speech recognition, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 2018-September, pp. 766-770, (2018); Bickelhaupt, Sebastian, Automated small bowel motility measurements in MRI using 2D coronal slices - does the intrasegmental location matter?

Both of them aim at constructing a block sparse matrix via linearly representing data to make them be embedded into linear subspaces. However, few datasets satisfy the linear subspace assumption in the real world. In this paper, data are peered from viewpoint of manifold architecture under the framework of sparse representation. A globally low-rank representation with the Frobenius norm minimization is constructed under the constraint of local manifold embedding and a novel low-rank local embedding representation (LRLER) model for subspace clustering of datasets is proposed. In this model, the local as well as global manifold structures of a dataset are concerned. Clusters of a dataset are considered as sub-manifolds embedded in low-dimensional subspaces. To represent and segment samples with hybrid neighbors or interlaced manifold structures, the local tangent space analysis strategy is introduced to characterize the local structure of neighborhood of samples. The coefficients of locally linear embedding are rectified according to the relationship between local tangent spaces of samples and their neighbors. A local tangent space based low-rank local embedding representation model (LRLTSER) is built to deal with data with neighborhood aliasing distortion.

It can handle a special type of attributes with preference-ordered domains by a dominance relation. This article mainly focuses on employing the DRSA to process composite ordered decision systems including categorical, numerical, set-valued, interval-valued and missing attributes, and dynamic maintenance of the lower and upper approximations under the attribute generalization. Firstly, we introduce a new composite dominance-based rough set model in which the composite dominance relation may not satisfy three basic properties, i.e., reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity. Based on the proposed relation, we redefine the lower and upper approximations of upward and downward unions of decision classes. Then, we present matrix-based methods for calculating approximations through introducing the dominant (dominated) matrix and other induced matrices. In addition, we put forward the matrix-based incremental approaches for the update of approximations in composite ordered decision systems while the attribute set varies with time, which can avoid reconstructing these matrices from scratch. Finally, according to a series of comparative experimental results, it can easily be observed that our proposed incremental updating methods have a great advantage in improving the computational performance for dynamic attribute generalization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attribute Generalization; Composite Ordered Rough Set Model; Incremental Learning; Matrix Representation; Data Handling; Attribute Generalizations; Dominance Rough Set Approaches; Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (drsa); Incremental Learning; Lower And Upper Approximations; Matrix Representation; Multi-criteria Classification; Rough Set Models; Rough Set Theory","Data handling; Attribute generalizations; Dominance rough set approaches; Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA); Incremental learning; Lower and upper approximations; Matrix representation; Multi-criteria classification; Rough set models; Rough set theory","","","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61573292 , 61572406 , 61603313 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (No. 220710004005040177 ).","Pawlak, Zdzislaw X., Rough sets, International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences, 11, 5, pp. 341-356, (1982); Rough Sets Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Data, (1991); Pawlak, Zdzislaw X., Rudiments of rough sets, Information Sciences, 177, 1, pp. 3-27, (2007); Pawlak, Zdzislaw X., Rough set theory and its applications to data analysis, Cybernetics and Systems, 29, 7, pp. 661-688, (1998); Journal of Software, (1999); Eskandari, Sadegh, Online streaming feature selection using rough sets, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 69, pp. 35-57, (2016); Dy, Jennifer G., Feature selection for unsupervised learning, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, pp. 845-889, (2004); Fakih, Saif J., LEAD: A methodology for learning efficient approaches to medical diagnosis, IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, 10, 2, pp. 220-228, (2006); Wu, Jian, A social network analysis trust-consensus based approach to group decision-making problems with interval-valued fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, Knowledge-Based Systems, 59, pp. 97-107, (2014); Hu, Qinghua, Neighborhood classifiers, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 866-876, (2008)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068754098"

The City of Kitakyushu, Japan has actively implemented eco-friendly policies since 1967 and recently inspired the pursuit of sustainable development around the world, especially in the Global South region. However, empirical studies on the effects of green growth policies are still lacking. This study explores the relationship between road infrastructure development and average industrial firm size with air pollution in the city through the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Non-linear Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) methods were applied on nearly 50-years’ time series data, from 1967 to 2015. The results show that the shape of the EKC of industrial growth, measured by average firm size, depends on the type of air pollution: inverted N-shaped relationships with NO<inf>2</inf> and CO, and the U-shaped relationships with falling dust particle and O<inf>x</inf>. Regarding infrastructure development, on the one hand, our analysis shows a positive effect of road construction on alleviating the amount of falling dust and CO concentration. On the other hand, the emissions of NO<inf>2</inf> and O<inf>x</inf> are shown to rise when plotted against road construction. The decline of CO emission, when plotted against both industrial growth and road development, indicates that the ruthlessness of the local government in pursuing green growth policies has been effective in this case. However, the story is not straightforward when it comes to other air pollutants, which hints at the limits of the current policies. The case of Kitakyushu illustrates the complex dynamics of the interaction among policy, industry, infrastructure, and air pollution. It can serve as an important reference point for other cities in the Global South when policies are formed, and progress is measured in the pursuit of a green economy. Finally, as an OECD SDGs pilot city and the leading Asian green-growth city, policymakers in Kitakyushu city are recommended to revise the data policy to enhance the findability and interoperability of data, as well as to invest in the application of big data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abokyi, Eric, Industrial growth and emissions of CO2 in Ghana: The role of financial development and fossil fuel consumption, Energy Reports, 5, pp. 1339-1353, (2019); Ahmad, Najid, Modelling the CO2 emissions and economic growth in Croatia: Is there any environmental Kuznets curve?, Energy, 123, pp. 164-172, (2017); Akbostancı, Elif, The relationship between income and environment in Turkey: Is there an environmental Kuznets curve?, Energy Policy, 37, 3, pp. 861-867, (2009); Ali, Wajahat, Re-visiting the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for Malaysia: Fresh evidence from ARDL bounds testing approach, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 77, pp. 990-1000, (2017); Andreoni, James, The simple analytics of the environmental Kuznets curve, Journal of Public Economics, 80, 2, pp. 269-286, (2001); Anenberg, Susan Casper, Estimates of the global burden of ambient PM2:5, ozone, and NO2 on asthma incidence and emergency room visits, Environmental Health Perspectives, 126, 10, (2018); Banerjee, Anindya, Error-correction mechanism tests for cointegration in a single-equation framework, Journal of Time Series Analysis, 19, 3, pp. 267-283, (1998); Barnes, Paul W., Ozone depletion, ultraviolet radiation, climate change and prospects for a sustainable future, Nature Sustainability, 2, 7, pp. 569-579, (2019); Saqib, Abdul, The renewable energy, growth and environmental Kuznets curve in Turkey: An ARDL approach, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 52, pp. 587-595, (2015); Society 5 0, (2020)","","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

In the traditional method where manual labour and experiences play important roles, early plant disease detection and prevention for field crop are inefficient. This can bring negative effects in stopping the spread of diseases. Applications of image processing techniques and computer vision may provide a solution to these problems. Deep learning is known as one of the most powerful techniques which is able to address more complicated tasks compared to traditional machine learning thanks to the embedded complex layers. This paper presents an image-based diseases identification method using a deep neural network with contrast enhancement and transfer learning from the PlantVillage dataset. Since there exist various sizes of leaf, rescaling and centre alignment are performed to standardize images. Besides, contrast enhancement is used to improve quality of visualization which gives a well-prepared step for further processing.

Among researches about RLL code, soft input soft output (SISO) RLL decoding scheme is proved significantly improving the error correction performance of the entire VLC system. However, it suffers from high computational complexity. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposed a deep learning framework that effectively performs the RLL decoding at a VLC receiver. The proposed framework makes use of a one-layer long short term memory (LSTM) followed by a fully-connected layer to learn the input-output relation of RLL decoder. Additionally, we present numerical results to validate the excellent performance of the proposed RLL decoder. The results exhibit that the combination between FEC and DL-based RLL approach is capable of achieving the bit error rate (BER) performance of concatenated FEC and SISO RLL decoder; while substantially reducing computational complexity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Long-short Term Memory; Recurrent Neural Network; Run-length Limited (rll); Visible Light Communication (vlc); Bit Error Rate; Brain; Complex Networks; Computational Complexity; Decoding; Deep Neural Networks; Error Correction; Forward Error Correction; Light; Long Short-term Memory; Recurrent Neural Networks; Visible Light Communication; Bit Error Rate (ber) Performance; Correction Performance; Input-output Relations; Learning Frameworks; Run Length Limited Code; Run Length Limiteds; Soft Input Soft Output; Visible Light Communications (vlc); Deep Learning","Bit error rate; Brain; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Decoding; Deep neural networks; Error correction; Forward error correction; Light; Long short-term memory; Recurrent neural networks; Visible light communication; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Correction performance; Input-output relations; Learning frameworks; Run length limited code; Run length limiteds; Soft input soft output; Visible light communications (VLC); Deep learning","","","","Khan, Latif Ullah, Visible light communication: Applications, architecture, standardization and research challenges, Digital Communications and Networks, 3, 2, pp. 78-88, (2017); Rajagopal, Sridhar, IEEE 802.15.7 visible light communication: Modulation schemes and dimming support, IEEE Communications Magazine, 50, 3, pp. 72-82, (2012); IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks Part 15 7 Short Range Wireless Optical Communication Using Visible Light, (2011); Kim, Sunghwan, Novel FEC coding scheme for dimmable visible light communication based on the modified Reed-Muller codes, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 23, 20, pp. 1514-1516, (2011); Lee, Sang Hyun, Turbo code-based error correction scheme for dimmable visible light communication systems, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 24, 17, pp. 1463-1465, (2012); Fang, Junbing Bin, An efficient flicker-Free FEC coding scheme for dimmable visible light communication based on polar codes, IEEE Photonics Journal, 9, 3, (2017); Wang, He, Soft-input soft-output run-length limited decoding for visible light communication, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 28, 3, pp. 225-228, (2016); Wang, He, Bit-level soft run-length limited decoding algorithm for visible light communication, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 28, 3, pp. 237-240, (2016); Wang, He, Dimming Control Systems with Polar Codes in Visible Light Communication, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 29, 19, pp. 1651-1654, (2017); IEICE Commun Express, (2018)","Bao, V.N.Q.; Thanh, T.T.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","25th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications, APCC 2019","","Ho Chi Minh City","158394","","9781728136790","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082971914"

However, the more sensor data are collected, the higher probability the faulty data occurs. The existence of faulty data may drive any system to make incorrect decisions and actions. It is clear that the faulty data should be detected and corrected as earlier as possible. In other words, the sensor data should be verified in the collecting steps. To best of our knowledge, the sensor data verification in the collecting process has not been well investigated. This research proposes a framework to address this issue right before the sensor data are stored. The verification makes use of a data forecasting technique to estimate the correct range of values for each received point of sensor data. The proposed system was implemented on a real test-bed on a Raspberry Pi 3. The experimental results show the proposed system can detect and correct faulty sensor data in less than 50ms.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) reduce the video traffic by storing replicas of videos in their cache servers. Nonetheless, the cache servers are usually located outside Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This implies that CDNs cannot reduce the video traffic inside ISP networks. To mitigate this issue, many ISPs build their own CDNs called Telco-CDNs. Genetic Algorithm-based caching is deemed the best approach in terms of traffic reduction. However, it is not practical since its computation time to generate content allocations is extremely long even when using a cluster. A color-based approach was devised to help overcome the drawback at the expense of its increase in traffic. Nevertheless, in case the number of content categories or requests proliferates quickly, the approach also has the same limitation like the Genetic Algorithm-based caching. To resolve the limitation, we propose two novel techniques to hamper the increase in the computation time. One is able to cope with the situation when the number of content categories increases while the other can deal with the circumstance when the number of requests rises. The empirical results show that the computation time is reduced 5x for the former and 7x for the latter at the expense of 1% and 12% increase in traffic for a problem of 5,000 contents, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Color-based Caching; Scalable; Telco-cdns; Time Complexity; Color; Genetic Algorithms; Color Based Approaches; Computation Time; Content Delivery Network; Internet Traffic; Scalable; Telco-cdns; Time Complexity; Traffic Reduction; Internet Service Providers","Color; Genetic algorithms; Color based approaches; Computation time; Content delivery network; Internet traffic; scalable; telco-CDNs; Time complexity; Traffic reduction; Internet service providers","","","This research was conducted within the project of Optimizing Color-Based Cooperative Caching Algorithm for Tclco-CDNs sponsored by TIS (IT Holding Group).","Zettabyte Era Trends and Analysis, (2025); Maggs, Bruce M., Algorithmic nuggets in content delivery, Computer Communication Review, 45, 3, pp. 52-66, (2015); Li, Zhe, In a Telco-CDN, pushing content makes sense, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 10, 3, pp. 300-311, (2013); Netflix Open Connect Appliance Deployment Guide, (2019); Faqs Akamai Accelerated Network Partner Aanp Program, (2019); Google Edge Network, (2019); Jiang, Joe Wenjie, Cooperative content distribution and traffic engineering in an ISP network, 37, 1, pp. 239-250, (2009); Li, Zhe, Network friendly video distribution, pp. 6-13, (2012); Three New White Papers Released on the Telco Cdn Space, (2011); Sharma, Abhigyan, Distributing content simplifies ISP traffic engineering, Performance Evaluation Review, 41, 1 SPEC.

The main purpose is to model the language as a logical form like a machine translation task. Recently, an approach which uses a Neural network with Sequence to sequence model (Seq2seq) has achieved positive results. However, there are many challenges which have not been solved thoroughly yet, especially in the problem of rare words. Rare words in a natural sentence are usually the name of an object, a place or number, time, etc. Although these words are very various and difficult for the model to capture meaning, it holds a key information role in human communication (for example: name all the rivers in Colorado ?). There are some methods to solve this problem such as using Attention or using Copy mechanism. However, these methods still difficult to copy phrase rare words, especially in case these phrases are variable in size. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve this problem, namely Marking mechanism in Seq2seq. The main idea is to label special words which are rare-words in a sentence by the encoder (marking step) and the decoder represents the logical form based on those labels (transforming step). Our experiments demonstrate that this approach works effectively, achieved a competitive result with old methods on all 3 datasets Geo, Atis, Jobs and special outperformed on our Artificial dataset. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Encoder Label; Marking Mechanism; Rare Word; Semantic Parsing; Natural Language Processing Systems; Semantics; Signal Encoding; Syntactics; Systems Engineering; Human Communications; Logical Forms; Machine Translations; Mapping Language; Natural Language Processing; Rare Word; Semantic Parsing; Sequence Modeling; Context Free Grammars","Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Signal encoding; Syntactics; Systems engineering; Human communications; Logical forms; Machine translations; Mapping Language; NAtural language processing; Rare word; Semantic parsing; Sequence modeling; Context free grammars","","","This research is funded by the Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG), Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), and Asian Office of Aerospace Research & Development (AOARD) under Award Numbers N62909-18-1-2072 and 17IOA031.","Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks, (2014); Luong, Minhthang, Addressing the rare word problem in neural machine translation, 1, pp. 11-19, (2015); Incorporating Copying Mechanism in Sequence to Sequence Learning, (2016); Pointer Networks, (2015); Get to the Point Summarization with Pointer Generator Networks, (2017); Pointing the Unknown Words, (2016); Language to Logical Form with Neural Attention, (2016); Structvae Tree Structured Latent Variable Models for Semi Supervised Semantic Parsing, (2018); Data Recombination for Neural Semantic Parsing, (2016); Icml, (2001)","Mothe, J.; Son, L.H.; Vinh, N.T.Q.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)","11th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering, KSE 2019","","Da Nang","155691","","9781728130033","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077064397"

Prior studies introduced several strong models for this task; however, there are gaps from papers to the reproduction of such models. This paper leverages the gaps by investigating summa-rization algorithms to facilitate next studies. The investigation was conducted by implementing traditional and state-of-the-art methods, from unsupervised to supervised learning fashion. We used three datasets in English and Vietnamese to confirm the efficiency of the methods. Experimental results indicate that sophisticated models obtain improvements of ROUGE-scores compared to the basic ones, which do not use social information. However, in some cases, simple methods comparably perform state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that the performance of summarization methods can be still improved. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Social Context Summarization; Summarization; Cell Proliferation; Social Aspects; Systems Engineering; Simple Method; Social Context; Social Information; State-of-the-art Methods; Summarization; Vietnamese; Web Document; Information Use","Cell proliferation; Social aspects; Systems engineering; SIMPLE method; Social context; Social information; State-of-the-art methods; Summarization; Vietnamese; Web document; Information use","","","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by Ministry of Education and Training under the grant number B2019-SKH-01.","Spärck Jones, Karen, Automatic summarising: The state of the art, Information Processing and Management, 43, 6, pp. 1449-1481, (2007); Nenkova, Ani, Automatic summarization, Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 5, 2-3, pp. 103-233, (2011); Yeh, Jenyuan, Text summarization using a trainable summarizer and latent semantic analysis, Information Processing and Management, 41, 1, pp. 75-95, (2005); Shen, Dou, Document summarization using conditional random fields, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 2862-2867, (2007); Zhongyuwei, Wei, Utilizing microblogs for automatic news highlights extraction, pp. 872-883, (2014); Li, Chen, Using relevant public posts to enhance news article summarization, pp. 557-566, (2016); Nguyen, Minh Tien, SoRTESum: A social context framework for single-document summarization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9626, pp. 3-14, (2016); Nguyen, Minh Tien, Social context summarization using user-generated content and third-party sources, Knowledge-Based Systems, 144, pp. 51-64, (2018); Wei, Zhongyu, Gibberish, assistant, or master?

However, this method requires an understanding of relational database, data schema, and SQL syntax as well as the way it works. Database manipulation using natural language, therefore, is much more convenient since any normal user can interact with their data without a background of database and SQL. This is, however, really tough because transforming natural language commands into SQL queries is a challenging task in natural language processing and understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase approach to automatically analyzing and converting natural language queries into the corresponding SQL forms. In our approach, the first phase is component segmentation which identifies primary clauses in SQL such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, etc. The second phase is slot- filling that helps extract sub-components for each primary clause such as SELECT column(s), SELECT aggregation operation, etc. We carefully conducted an empirical evaluation for our method using conditional random fields (CRFs) on a medium-sized corpus of natural language queries in Vietnamese, and have achieved promising results with an average accuracy of more than 90%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Transform Natural Language Query To Sql Query; Understanding Natural Language Query; Information Management; Query Languages; Query Processing; Systems Engineering; Aggregation Operation; Conditional Random Fields(crfs); Empirical Evaluations; Natural Language Processing; Natural Language Queries; Natural Languages; Relational Database; Structured Query Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems","Information management; Query languages; Query processing; Systems engineering; Aggregation operation; Conditional Random Fields(CRFs); Empirical evaluations; NAtural language processing; Natural language queries; Natural languages; Relational Database; Structured query languages; Natural language processing systems","","","","Annals of Mathematical Statistics, (1966); Cortes, Corinna, Support-Vector Networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Language to Logical Form with Neural Attention, (2016); Proceedings of Coling 2012 Posters, (2012); Iyer, Srinivasan, Learning a neural semantic parser from user feedback, 1, pp. 963-973, (2017); Icml, (2001); Li, Yunyao, Constructing a generic natural language interface for an XML database, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3896 LNCS, pp. 737-754, (2006); Mou, Lili, Coupling distributed and symbolic execution for natural language queries, (2017); Pasupat, Panupong, Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables, 1, pp. 1470-1480, (2015); Popescu, Ana Maria, Towards a theory of natural language interfaces to databases, International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, Proceedings IUI, pp. 149-157, (2003)","Mothe, J.; Son, L.H.; Vinh, N.T.Q.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)","11th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering, KSE 2019","","Da Nang","155691","","9781728130033","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077042704"

In recent years, the fast development electronic medical records (EMRs) has provided valuable resources for solving healthcare issues, especially learning and recommending treatments. However, most of the related studies are limited in exploiting various patient information, handling varying-length treatment records, capturing different kinds of treatment patterns and interpreting the recommendation mechanism. This research proposes three methods, one for learning and two for recommending treatments, to overcome the above drawbacks. All methods adopt a mixed-variate restrict Boltzmann machine to represent different kinds of patient records. The treatment learning method captures significant changes in prescription indication to split varying-length records flexibly and organizes sequences of prescription drugs into regimen trees to reveal many more different kinds of treatment patterns. The two treatment recommendation methods illustrate different ideas that can improve the treatment recommendation mechanism by combining the treatments derived from patient groups and neighbor patients. Our experimental evaluation was conducted on three acute disease cohorts extracted from the MIMIC III database. The obtained results show that the proposed methods are able to provide different kinds of treatment patterns and yield competitive efficacy with better interpretability as compared to relevant studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic Medical Records; Healthcare Mining; Treatment Patterns; Treatment Recommendation; Treatment Regimen; E-learning; Medical Computing; Electronic Medical Record; Electronic Medical Records (emrs); Experimental Evaluation; Recommendation Mechanism; Recommendation Methods; Treatment Patterns; Treatment Recommendation; Treatment Regimen; Patient Treatment","E-learning; Medical computing; Electronic medical record; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Experimental evaluation; Recommendation mechanism; Recommendation methods; Treatment patterns; Treatment recommendation; Treatment regimen; Patient treatment","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by Vietnam National University at Ho Chi Minh City in the project “Development of core technology for exploiting electronic medical records” under the grant B2019-42-01 and by Asian Office of Aerospace R&D (Japan) under agreement number FA2386-18-1-4029 .

To capture such information, we should exploit the characteristics of education end-users’ requests with high spatial–temporal locality. This paper aims to develop resource popularity modeling techniques for enhancing the performance of educational resource prefetching. Specifically, a novel topic model, built on an accelerated spectral clustering and an ontology concept similarity, is proposed to support resource access based on semantic features, including topic relevance and spatial–temporal locality. Using the proposed model, an adaptive prefetching inference approach is presented to associate possible popular resources in the future data requests. Also, an efficient prefetching management mechanism incorporating with replica techniques is suggested to design resource cloud storage systems for geo-distributed educational applications. Experiments over a simulation setting and a real-world case study with seven million users across China are carried out. Results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Educational Resources; Prefetching Mechanism; Semantic Inference; Spatial–temporal Locality; Topic Information; Clustering Algorithms; Human Computer Interaction; Semantics; Educational Resource; Prefetching; Semantic Inference; Temporal Locality; Topic Information; Digital Storage","Clustering algorithms; Human computer interaction; Semantics; Educational resource; Prefetching; Semantic inference; Temporal locality; Topic information; Digital storage","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61877020), the Science and Technology Projects of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2015A030401087, 2018B010109002), the Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou Municipality, China (No. 201904010393), and the Golden Seed Project of Challenge Cup of Extra-Curricular Academic Competition Works by South China Normal University, China (No. 19JXKC01).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61877020 ), the Science and Technology Projects of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2015A030401087 , 2018B010109002 ), the Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou Municipality, China (No. 201904010393 ), and the Golden Seed Project of Challenge Cup of Extra-Curricular Academic Competition Works by South China Normal University, China (No. 19JXKC01 ).","González-Martínez, José Antonio, Cloud computing and education: A state-of-the-art survey, Computers and Education, 80, pp. 132-151, (2015); Caminero, A.

Carry-over variables are those continuously held from one term to another, reflecting dynamic components. Apart from considering dynamic aspects, the DEA model called dynamic slacks-based measure with network structure can address various inputs and outputs at both stages and multiple intermediates that link the two stages. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model under the assumption of variable returns to scale to the performance evaluation of 30 insurance companies in Malaysia from 2008 to 2016. Specifically, we gauge resource management and investment efficiencies as the two production stages of insurance companies. While investment asset is considered the carry-over variable, investment income is treated as one of the ultimate outputs. Results indicate that the discriminatory power of the overall performance is high when we consider investments, particularly investment assets, as a carry-over variable. Moreover, we employ a multi-criteria decision analysis to compare all insurance companies in a common setting, including each ratio of liquidity, profitability, and leverage. The decision to include these ratios is made after performing regression analyses.

A novel ordinal consensus measure with an objective threshold based on preference orderings is proposed. This process contains five parts: (1) obtaining ordinal preferences; (2) classifying all decision-makers into several subgroups using the ordinal k-means clustering algorithm; (3) measuring consensus levels of subgroups and the global group using novel ordinal consensus indexes; (4) providing suggestions for decision-makers to revise preferences using feedback strategies; (5) obtaining final decision result. An illustrative example is provided to verify the implementation of the proposed consensus model. Lastly, we discuss the approaches to determine the appropriate number of clusters and the initialization center points for the proposed ordinal k-means clustering algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heterogeneous; K-means Clustering; Large-scale Group Decision Making; Ordinal Consensus; Preference Relation; K-means Clustering; Feedback Strategies; Group Decision Making Problems; Heterogeneous; Large-scale Group; Ordinal Consensus; Ordinal Preference; Preference Information; Preference Relation; Decision Making","K-means clustering; Feedback strategies; Group decision making problems; Heterogeneous; Large-scale group; Ordinal consensus; Ordinal preference; Preference information; Preference relation; Decision making","","","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71771156 ), the 2019 Soft Science Project of Sichuan Science and Technology Department (No. 2019JDR0141 ), the 2019 Sichuan Planning Project of Social Science (No. SC18A007 ), and the Graduate Student’s Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, China (No. 2018YJSY038 ).","Rules for Reaching Consensus A Modern Approach to Decision Making, (1994); Herrera-Viedma, Enrique Enrique, A review of soft consensus models in a fuzzy environment, Information Fusion, 17, 1, pp. 4-13, (2014); Herrera, Francisco P., A model of consensus in group decision making under linguistic assessments, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 78, 1, pp. 73-87, (1996); Liao, Huchang, Framework of group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy preference information, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 23, 4, pp. 1211-1227, (2015); He, Yue, A consensus reaching model for hesitant information with different preference structures, Knowledge-Based Systems, 135, pp. 99-112, (2017); Xu, Xuanhua, Consensus model for multi-criteria large-group emergency decision making considering non-cooperative behaviors and minority opinions, Decision Support Systems, 79, pp. 150-160, (2015); Xu, Xuanhua, A dynamical consensus method based on exit-delegation mechanism for large group emergency decision making, Knowledge-Based Systems, 86, pp. 237-249, (2015); Palomares, Iván, A consensus model to detect and manage noncooperative behaviors in large-scale group decision making, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 22, 3, pp. 516-530, (2014); Liu, Bingsheng, A two-layer weight determination method for complex multi-attribute large-group decision-making experts in a linguistic environment, Information Fusion, 23, pp. 156-165, (2015); Zadeh, Lotfi A., Fuzzy sets, Information and control, 8, 3, pp. 338-353, (1965)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065798233"

It should be noted that efficient estimation of gamma model parameters for samples ‘not large’ is a challenging task since the exact sampling distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators and its variants are not known. Estimation of a gamma scale parameter has received less attention from the earlier researchers compared to shape parameter estimation. What we have observed here is that improved estimation of the shape parameter does not necessarily lead to improved scale estimation if a natural moment condition (which is also the maximum likelihood restriction) is satisfied. Therefore, this work deals with the gamma scale parameter estimation as a separate new problem, not as a by-product of the shape parameter estimation, and studies several estimators in terms of second-order risk. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gamma Scale Parameter; Maximum Likelihood Estimator; Scaled Quadratic Loss Function; Second-order Admissibility (inadmissibility); Simultaneous Estimation","","","","For the second author, this research has been funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology Development of Ton Duc Thang University (FOSTECT), website: http://fostect.edu.vn [grant number FOSTECT.2015.BR.20].","Proschan, Frank, Theoretical Explanation of Observed Decreasing Failure Rate, Technometrics, 5, 3, pp. 375-383, (1963); Keating, Jerome P., Testing hypotheses about the shape parameter of a gamma distribution, Technometrics, 32, 1, pp. 67-82, (1990); McDonald, James B., An analysis of some properties of alternative measures of income inequality based on the gamma distribution function, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 74, 368, pp. 856-860, (1979); Bougeault, P., Cloud-ensemble relations based on the gamma probability distribution for the higher-order models of the planetary boundary layer., Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 39, 12, pp. 2691-2700, (1982); Coe, Richard I.C., Fitting models to daily rainfall data ( Jordan, Niger, Botswana, Sri Lanka)., Journal of Applied Meteorology, 21, 7, pp. 1024-1031, (1982); Singh, Vijay P., DERIVATION OF THE GAMMA DISTRIBUTION BY USING THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMUM ENTROPY (POME), Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 21, 6, pp. 941-952, (1985); Matis, James H., Use of the gamma distribution for predicting arrival times of invading insect populations, Environmental Entomology, 21, 3, pp. 436-440, (1992); Berman, Mark, The Maximum Likelihood Estimators Of The Parameters Of The Gamma Distribution Are Always Positively Biased, Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods, 10, 7, pp. 693-697, (1981); Sankhya Ser B, (1969); Communications in Statistics, (1975)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","02331888; 10294910","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067576123"

The lack of serious analysis has caused great concern for practitioners and policymakers as public policy targeting the inequality in income and wealth across genders has not achieved their desired outcomes. Previous studies on gender in emerging markets have focused on income rather than wealth. This paper provides a comprehensive review and insightful policy recommendations on the important issue. Using data from Vietnam's Household Living Standard Survey (VHLSS), the paper examines the gender wealth inequality for sole-head families and partner-head families in Vietnam in 2016, the latest year for which data are available. In addition, the paper extends the Machado-Mata decomposition technique based on the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, which was developed for quantile regressions, to examine the relationship across the distributions of wealth accumulation. The empirical findings from the paper indicate that, among partnered heads, female-head families experienced a larger gap of wealth accumulation. At the lower quantiles of wealth accumulation, the gender wealth gap is primarily associated with different characteristics for both sole and partner-head households. At the median and upper tails of the distribution of wealth accumulation, gender differences in endowments (such as education level and living area) are the main determinants in explaining the wealth gap. Given the empirical findings in the paper, policy implications emerge for the Vietnam Government to consider policies targeting a support for females as female-head families appear to be poorer than their male-head counterparts in terms of wealth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Female-head Households; Gender Wealth Gap; Male-head Households; Quantile Regressions; Vietnam; Wealth Gap Decomposition","","","","The authors are grateful to a reviewer for helpful comments and suggestions.

In this paper, a new method to tackle this challenge by leveraging the content and context of daily activities is introduced. The backbone idea of this method is, under the same context (e.g., a particular activity), one image should have at least one associative image (e.g., same content, same concepts) taken from different moments. Thus, a given set of images can be rearranged chronologically by ordering their associative images whose orders are known precisely.

In this paper, a new method to meet this challenge by utilizing the hypothesis that a sequence of images taken during a specific period can share the same context and content is introduced. This hypothesis can be explained in another way that if there is one image satisfies a given query (i.e., seed); then a certain number of its spatiotemporal neighbors probably can share the same content and context (i.e., watershed).

Despite the fact that various models have been developed, few of them address the short-term popularity prediction. Toward this goal, we exploit the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer, a state-of-the-art model in neural machine translation, to forecast the values of multiple time series in the near future. Specifically, we propose an attention-based non-recursive neural network, a novel model that entirely dispenses with recurrence and convolutions, for time series prediction. Since our model is the combination of the input attention mechanism in the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) and the self-attention of Transformer, it is able to adaptively select the most relevant input sequences as well as capture the long-term dependencies across previous time steps to make the prediction. The experiments show the root mean square errors (RMSEs) achieved by our model are only 6.06 and 3.60 when testing on the NASDAQ 100 dataset and the views count of the top most popular videos on Youtube respectively, while the RMSEs of DA-RNN are 8.52 and 12.31. Hence, our model outperforms the baseline not only in time series prediction but also in contents popularity prediction aspect. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Time Series Prediction; Transformer; Youtube Video; Data Communication Systems; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Mean Square Error; Smart City; Statistical Tests; Time Series; Long-term Dependencies; Machine Translations; Popularity Predictions; Recursive Neural Networks; Root Mean Square Errors; Time Series Prediction; Transformer; Youtube; Recurrent Neural Networks","Data communication systems; Deep learning; Forecasting; Mean square error; Smart city; Statistical tests; Time series; Long-term dependencies; Machine translations; Popularity predictions; Recursive neural networks; Root mean square errors; Time series prediction; Transformer; YouTube; Recurrent neural networks","","","This research was conducted within the project Optimizing Color-Based Cooperative Caching Algorithm for Telco-CDNs sponsored by TIS Inc.

This topic has attracted the attention of many computer scientists, as well as the financial sector. In computer science, a predictive model will be developed to analyse a firm's financial statements to predict its fate in the future based on the existing bankruptcy dataset. Many machine learning models have been developed to predict bankruptcy using specific datasets. This manuscript proposes a fast and accurate approach that utilises GPU-based extreme gradient boosting machine using squared logistics loss (SqLL) denoted by gXGBS for bankruptcy forecasting on both scenarios, including an imbalanced dataset (Korean bankruptcy dataset [KRBDS]) and two balanced datasets (USA bankruptcy dataset [USABDS] and Japanese bankruptcy dataset [JPNBDS]). To improve the performance of this prediction task, the study uses a custom loss function, namely SqLL, for an extreme gradient boosting machine to propose XGBS algorithm. Then, this study employs a GPU-based implementation of a decision tree construction algorithm (gDTC) to accelerate the processing time of XGBS. This is called a gXGBS algorithm. In addition, we also utilise a histogram-based tree construction algorithm using multi-GPU (gHTC), an approximation algorithm, for a gXGBS algorithm that will propose the third algorithm, namely gXGBS_hist, for the large datasets. The comprehensive experiments were conducted on three experimental datasets to evaluate the proposed approaches. The experimental results indicate that our proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for bankruptcy forecasting in terms of geometric mean (G-mean), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and processing time for all experimental datasets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bankruptcy Forecasting; Class Imbalance Problem; Extreme Gradient Boosting; Gpu Computing; Squared Logistics Loss; Approximation Algorithms; Data Mining; Decision Trees; Financial Markets; Forecasting; Graphics Processing Unit; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Trees (mathematics); Class Imbalance Problems; Decision Tree Construction; Gpu Computing; Gradient Boosting; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine Learning Models; Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves; Tree Construction Algorithms; Large Dataset","Approximation algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Financial markets; Forecasting; Graphics processing unit; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Trees (mathematics); Class imbalance problems; Decision tree construction; GPU computing; Gradient boosting; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Tree construction algorithms; Large dataset","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning), Korea, under the National Program for Excellence in SW (2015-0-00938) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the MSIP ( Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning ), Korea, under the National Program for Excellence in SW ( 2015-0-00938 ) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).","Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); SIGKDD Explorations, (2004); Bennin, Kwabena Ebo, MAHAKIL: Diversity Based Oversampling Approach to Alleviate the Class Imbalance Issue in Software Defect Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 6, pp. 534-550, (2018); Bi, Jingjun, An empirical comparison on state-of-the-art multi-class imbalance learning algorithms and a new diversified ensemble learning scheme, Knowledge-Based Systems, 158, pp. 81-93, (2018); Chang, Yungchia, Application of eXtreme gradient boosting trees in the construction of credit risk assessment models for financial institutions, Applied Soft Computing, 73, pp. 914-920, (2018); Charte, Francisco, Dealing with difficult minority labels in imbalanced mutilabel data sets, Neurocomputing, 326-327, pp. 39-53, (2019); Chawla, Nitesh Vinay, SMOTE: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002); Chawla, Nitesh Vinay, Automatically countering imbalance and its empirical relationship to cost, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 17, 2, pp. 225-252, (2008); Chen, Hongmei, Feature selection for imbalanced data based on neighborhood rough sets, Information Sciences, 483, pp. 1-20, (2019); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065095441"

TCP/NC uses additional sub-layer called Network Coding layer below the TCP layer to handle packet losses without sensed by the TCP layer. In our previous work, we introduced some variants of TCP/NC such as TCP/NCwLRLBE (TCP/NC with Loss Rate and Loss Burstiness Estimation) which can improve the retransmission and adapt to the changing of the channel. However, it is just evaluated on the simple packet loss conditions, e.g., random loss or Gilbert loss. On the other hand, reliable end-To-end data transfer in diverse IoT (Internet of Things) environments (e.g., Power Line Communication-PLC) in a cost-efficient manner is an emerging challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the characteristics of the TCP/NC on PLC networks, to have a more in-depth evaluation of its performance and applicability in a practical PLC environment with many conditions causing packet loss such as noise variants, distance, etc. The result of our simulation on ns-3 (Network Simulation 3) shows that TCP/NC can work well on PLC environment compared to the traditional protocols such as TCP NewReno with Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) and TCP Westwood+. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Iot; Network Coding; Packet Loss; Plc; Tcp/nc; Carrier Transmission On Power Lines; Codes (symbols); Data Transfer; Internet Of Things; Network Layers; Packet Loss; Petroleum Reservoir Evaluation; Programmable Logic Controllers; Transmission Control Protocol; Depth Evaluations; Network Simulation; Performance Characteristics; Power Line Communication Networks; Power Line Communications; Retransmission Control; Tcp/nc; Transmission Performance; Network Coding","Carrier transmission on power lines; Codes (symbols); Data transfer; Internet of things; Network layers; Packet loss; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Programmable logic controllers; Transmission control protocol; Depth evaluations; Network simulation; Performance characteristics; Power line communication networks; Power line communications; Retransmission control; TCP/NC; Transmission performance; Network coding","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2018-18-24.","Fu, Chengpeng, TCP Veno: TCP enhancement for transmission over wireless access networks, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 21, 2, pp. 216-228, (2003); Mascolo, Saverio, TCP Westwood: Bandwidth estimation for enhanced transport over wireless links, Proceedings of the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MOBICOM, pp. 287-297, (2001); Tsiknas, Konstantinos G., Comparative performance evaluation of TCP variants in WiMAX (and WLANs) network configurations, Journal of Computer Networks and Communications, (2012); Caini, Carlo, Comparative performance evaluation of TCP variants on satellite environments, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, (2009); Sundararajan, Jay Kumar, Network coding meets TCP: Theory and implementation, Proceedings of the IEEE, 99, 3, pp. 490-512, (2011); Ha, Nguyen Viet, TCP network coding with enhanced retransmission for heavy and bursty loss, IEICE Transactions on Communications, E100B, 2, pp. 293-303, (2017); Proc 6th Conf on Sys and Net Commun, (2011); Chan, Yicheng, Adaptive network coding scheme for TCP over wireless sensor networks, International Journal of Computers, Communications and Control, 8, 6, pp. 800-811, (2013); van Vu, Thuong, Dynamic coding for TCP transmission reliability in multi-hop wireless networks, (2014); Ha, Nguyen Viet, TCP network coding with adapting parameters for bursty and time-varying loss, IEICE Transactions on Communications, E101B, 2, pp. 476-488, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 International Conference on System Science and Engineering, ICSSE 2019","","Dong Hoi City, Quang Binh Province","151782","","9781728105253","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072928408"

Previous findings have shown that aberrant expression of miRNAs is associated with tumorigenesis and may lead to many human complex diseases. Although large amount of miRNAs have been identified in various species, unfortunately, the functions of majority of them still remain to be unraveled. The huge volume omics data provide an unprecedented opportunity for prioritizing disease miRNA candidates by computational methods, which contributes to elucidating the progression of human diseases and greatly facilitates cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a computational method called MRSLA to discover disease-associated miRNAs. We formulate the disease miRNA prioritization task as a recommender system that recommends those most likely miRNAs for given diseases based on low-rank approximation framework, which is an efficient machine learning algorithm that could effectively incorporate multi-modal features into the prediction model and produce a good performance. In MRSLA, we first utilized multi-view data sources, including known miRNA–disease associations, disease semantic information, experimentally verified miRNA–target gene interactions, and gene–gene interaction network, to estimate the miRNA similarity and disease similarity and then construct a bilayer heterogeneous network. After that, we project the miRNA–disease associations into two subspaces and develop a low-rank approximation-based recommendation method to predict disease miRNA candidates. In addition, to encourage sparsity and enhance the biological relevance of the results, the manifold regularizations and L <inf>1</inf> -norm constraints are imposed into the objective formulation to guide the prediction process. The results shown that MRSLA achieves superior performance compared with other methods and could effectively discover potential disease-associated miRNAs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disease-associated Mirnas; Heterogeneous Network; Manifold Regularization; Micrornas (mirnas); Recommendation Model; Approximation Algorithms; Approximation Theory; Association Reactions; Computational Methods; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Genes; Heterogeneous Networks; Lead Compounds; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Recommender Systems; Rna; Semantics; Disease Associations; Disease Similarities; Gene Interaction Networks; Learning-based Methods; Low Rank Approximations; Manifold Regularizations; Micrornas; Recommendation Methods; Diseases","Approximation algorithms; Approximation theory; Association reactions; Computational methods; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Genes; Heterogeneous networks; Lead compounds; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Recommender systems; RNA; Semantics; Disease associations; Disease similarities; Gene interaction networks; Learning-based methods; Low rank approximations; Manifold regularizations; MicroRNAs; Recommendation methods; Diseases","","","Funding text 1: This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 61572180, 61873089, 61473259), and the Hunan Provincial Science & Technology Project Foundation (2018TP1018, 2018RS3065).; Funding text 2: This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 61572180 , 61873089 , 61473259 ), and the Hunan Provincial Science & Technology Project Foundation ( 2018TP1018 , 2018RS3065 ).","Jopling, Catherine L., Molecular biology: Modulation of hepatitis C virus RNA abundance by a liver-specific MicroRNA, Science, 309, 5740, pp. 1577-1581, (2005); Yang, Li, HMDD v2.0: A database for experimentally supported human microRNA and disease associations, Nucleic Acids Research, 42, D1, pp. D1070-D1074, (2014); Yang, Zhen, DbDEMC 2.0: Updated database of differentially expressed miRNAs in human cancers, Nucleic Acids Research, 45, D1, pp. D812-D818, (2017); Cheng, Angie M., Antisense inhibition of human miRNAs and indications for an involvement of miRNA in cell growth and apoptosis, Nucleic Acids Research, 33, 4, pp. 1290-1297, (2005); Kalinowski, Felicity C., Regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Signaling and Erlotinib Sensitivity in Head and Neck Cancer Cells by miR-7, PLOS ONE, 7, 10, (2012); Gokhale, Amit, Distinctive microRNA signature of medulloblastomas associated with the WNT signaling pathway, Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics, 6, 4, pp. 521-529, (2010); Xiao, Qiu, CeModule: An integrative framework for discovering regulatory patterns from genomic data in cancer, BMC Bioinformatics, 20, 1, (2019); Jiang, Qinghua, Prioritization of disease microRNAs through a human phenome-microRNAome network, BMC Systems Biology, 4, SUPPL. 1, (2010); Shi, Hongbo, Walking the interactome to identify human miRNA-disease associations through the functional link between miRNA targets and disease genes, BMC Systems Biology, 7, (2013); Li, Xia, Prioritizing human cancer microRNAs based on genes' functional consistency between microRNA and cancer, Nucleic Acids Research, 39, 22, (2011)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063537933"

The former focuses on multi-stage thinking, problem solving, and information processing in threes under dynamic decision information systems. The latter aims to multilevel and multiview comprehension, abstraction, data representations in threes by information granularity and hierarchical granular structures. This paper explores the integration of both to process dynamic hybrid data by sequential three-way decision. In the context of three-way granular computing, we introduce three extensional ideas: temporality-based, spatiality-based, integration-based trisecting-acting-outcome (TAO) frameworks. Subsequently, we present three fundamental methods for the construction of multilevel composite granular structure. Three kinds of fusion strategies for dynamic hybrid data by decision attitudes and operation combinations are discussed. Finally, we design a composite sequential algorithm and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Fusion; Dynamic Hybrid Data; Sequential Three-way Decision; Temporal-spatial; Three-way Decision; Three-way Granular Computing; Data Fusion; Problem Solving; Data Representations; Granular Structuress; Hybrid Datum; Information Granularity; Sequential Algorithm; Sequential Three-way Decision; Temporal-spatial; Three-way Decision; Granular Computing","Data fusion; Problem solving; Data representations; Granular structuress; Hybrid datum; Information granularity; Sequential algorithm; Sequential three-way decision; Temporal-spatial; Three-way decision; Granular computing","","","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61573292 , 61876157 , 61773324 , 71571148 , 61572406 ).","Afridi, Mohammad Khan, A three-way clustering approach for handling missing data using GTRS, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 98, pp. 11-24, (2018); Computer Science, (2009); Fang, Yu, Cost-sensitive approximate attribute reduction with three-way decisions, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 104, pp. 148-165, (2019); Fujita, Hamido, Improving awareness in early stages of security analysis: A zone partition method based on GrC, Applied Intelligence, 49, 3, pp. 1063-1077, (2019); Fujita, Hamido, Resilience analysis of critical infrastructures: A cognitive approach based on granular computing, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 5, pp. 1835-1848, (2019); Guan, Yanyong, Set-valued information systems, Information Sciences, 176, 17, pp. 2507-2525, (2006); Hao, Chen, Optimal scale selection in dynamic multi-scale decision tables based on sequential three-way decisions, Information Sciences, 415-416, pp. 213-232, (2017); Hu, Qinghua, Neighborhood classifiers, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 866-876, (2008); Hu, Qinghua, Large-Scale Multimodality Attribute Reduction with Multi-Kernel Fuzzy Rough Sets, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26, 1, pp. 226-238, (2018); Huang, Yanyong, Dynamic Fusion of Multisource Interval-Valued Data by Fuzzy Granulation, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26, 6, pp. 3403-3417, (2018)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061992659"

This paper presents a moth–flame optimization-based protein complex prediction algorithm, called MFOC. First of all, we build the reliable weighted dynamic PPI networks by synthesizing topological and biological information. After that, we utilize a layer-by-layer scheme to find the cores of protein complexes as the flames and let the moths fly spirally around the flames to form the complexes. To be specific, the critical proteins have priority as the hearts and cores are extended by the hearts. And then we use MFOC algorithm to make the moths converge to the flames in order to obtain the protein complexes. At last, a two-step filtration operation is executed to refine the predicted protein complexes. The proposed algorithm MFOC is applied to the reliable weighted dynamic protein interaction networks including DIP, Krogan and MIPS, and the numerous comparison results show that MFOC outperforms other classic algorithms for identifying protein complexes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Critical Protein; Moth–flame Optimization (mfo) Algorithm; Protein Complex Prediction; Weighted Dynamic Ppi Network; Forecasting; Proteins; Biological Information; Biological Process; Optimization-based Algorithm; Ppi Networks; Prediction Algorithms; Protein Complexes; Protein Interaction; Synthetic Dynamics; Complex Networks","Forecasting; Proteins; Biological information; Biological process; Optimization-based algorithm; Ppi networks; Prediction algorithms; Protein complexes; Protein interaction; Synthetic dynamics; Complex networks","","","Funding text 1: This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61672334 , 61502290 , 61401263 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201901010 ).; Funding text 2: This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61672334, 61502290, 61401263) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201901010).","Spirin, Victor, Protein complexes and functional modules in molecular networks, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100, 21, pp. 12123-12128, (2003); Gavin, Anne Claude, Functional organization of the yeast proteome by systematic analysis of protein complexes, Nature, 415, 6868, pp. 141-147, (2002); De Las Rivas, Javier, Protein-protein interactions essentials: Key concepts to building and analyzing interactome networks, PLOS Computational Biology, 6, 6, pp. 1-8, (2010); Bader, Gary D., An automated method for finding molecular complexes in large protein interaction networks, BMC Bioinformatics, 4, (2003); Altaf-Ul-Amin, Md, Development and implementation of an algorithm for detection of protein complexes in large interaction networks, BMC Bioinformatics, 7, (2006); Graph Clustering by Flow Simulation, (2000); Nepusz, Tamás, Detecting overlapping protein complexes in protein-protein interaction networks, Nature Methods, 9, 5, pp. 471-472, (2012); Shen, Xianjun, Neighbor affinity based algorithm for discovering temporal protein complex from dynamic PPI network, Methods, 110, pp. 90-96, (2016); Lei, Xiujuan, Topology potential based seed-growth method to identify protein complexes on dynamic PPI data, Information Sciences, 425, pp. 140-153, (2018); Ou-Yang, Le, Detecting Protein Complexes from Signed Protein-Protein Interaction Networks, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, 12, 6, pp. 1333-1344, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062065788"

This information posses two important values in that (i) it reflects the content of an event and (ii) it shares hidden topics with sentences in the main document. In this paper, we present a novel model to capture the nature of relationships between document sentences and post information (comments or tweets) in sharing hidden topics for summarization of Web documents by utilizing relevant post information. Unlike previous methods which are usually based on hand-crafted features, our approach ranks document sentences and user posts based on their importance to the topics. The sentence-user-post relation is formulated in a share topic matrix, which presents their mutual reinforcement support. Our proposed matrix co-factorization algorithm computes the score of each document sentence and user post and extracts the top ranked document sentences and comments (or tweets) as a summary. We apply the model to the task of summarization on three datasets in two languages, English and Vietnamese, of social context summarization and also on DUC 2004 (a standard corpus of the traditional summarization task).

Our previous studies reported that monkey SC and pulvinar neurons responded preferentially to images of faces while performing a delayed non-matching to sample (DNMS) task to discriminate different visual stimuli (Nguyen et al., 2013, 2014). However, the contribution of SC and pulvinar neurons to the discrimination of the facial images and subsequent behavioral performance remains unknown. Since gamma oscillations have been implicated in sensory and cognitive processes as well as behavioral execution, we hypothesized that gamma oscillations during neuronal responses might contribute to achieving the appropriate behavioral performance (i.e., a correct response). In the present study, we re-analyzed those neuronal responses in the monkey SC and pulvinar to investigate possible relationships between gamma oscillations in these neurons and behavioral performance (correct response ratios) during the DNMS task. Gamma oscillations of SC and pulvinar neuronal activity were analyzed in three phases around the stimulus onset [inter-trial interval (ITI): 1000 ms before trial onset; Early: 0–200 ms after stimulus onset; and Late: 300–500 ms after stimulus onset]. We found that human facial images elicited stronger gamma oscillations in the early phase than the ITI and late phase in both the SC and pulvinar neurons. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between strengths of gamma oscillations in the early phase and behavioral performance in both the SC and pulvinar. The results suggest that gamma oscillatory activity in the SC and pulvinar contributes to successful behavioral performance during unconscious perceptual and behavioral processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Face; Gamma Oscillation; Pulvinar; Superior Colliculus; Animal Experiment; Ego Development; Face; Haplorhini; Nerve Cell; Nonhuman; Oscillation; Pulvinar; Stimulus; Superior Colliculus; Animal; Electroencephalography; Female; Gamma Rhythm; Human; Macaca Fuscata; Male; Photostimulation; Physiology; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Visual System; Animals; Discrimination, Psychological; Electroencephalography; Face; Female; Gamma Rhythm; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Pulvinar; Reaction Time; Superior Colliculi; Visual Pathways","animal experiment; ego development; face; Haplorhini; nerve cell; nonhuman; oscillation; pulvinar; stimulus; superior colliculus; animal; electroencephalography; female; gamma rhythm; human; Macaca fuscata; male; photostimulation; physiology; psychomotor performance; reaction time; visual system; Animals; Discrimination, Psychological; Electroencephalography; Face; Female; Gamma Rhythm; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Pulvinar; Reaction Time; Superior Colliculi; Visual Pathways","","","This research was supported partly by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) ( 16H04652 ) from Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan .

In HAS, video quality is generally varying in each streaming session. Therefore, a key question in HTTP Adaptive Streaming is how to evaluate the overall quality of a streaming session. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for overall quality prediction in HTTP Adaptive Streaming. In the proposed approach, each segment is represented by four features of segment quality, stalling durations, content characteristics, and padding. The features are fed into a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that is capable of exploring temporal relations between segments. The overall quality of the streaming session is predicted from the outputs of the LSTM network using a linear regression module. Experiment results show that the proposed approach is effective in predicting the overall quality of streaming sessions.

Bullying and mental health problems are important factors that can have a negative impact on the mental well-being of adolescents. Public awareness of mental health problems among adolescents is rapidly growing in Vietnam. However, current approaches to identifying risk factors influencing mental health problems do not pay attention to potentially protective factors. This study was performed to examine the associations between parent-adolescent bonding and mental health outcomes as protective elements during the adolescent period. Methods: Data collected from 3331 respondents in grade 8-12 as part of the Vietnam Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) 2013 was used for the analysis. A three-stage cluster sample design was used to produce data representative of students. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association of demographic characteristics and data regarding parent-adolescent bonding associations with status of mental health problems in adolescents. Results: Parental understanding, parental monitoring were significantly associated with reduced likelihood of being bullied and mental health problems (P < 0.05). However, parental control was significantly associated with greater likelihoods of being physically attacked (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 1.36, 95%CI, 1.06, 1.75) and mental health problems, such as suicidal ideation, and loneliness (aOR = 1.96, 95%CI, 1.49, 2.57, aOR = 2.35, 95%CI, 1.75, 3.15, respectively), after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions: The study indicated the significant associations between parental understanding, monitoring and control in a proxy of parent-adolescent bonding and mental well-being during the period of adolescent rebellion. Thus, parent-adolescent bonding in Southeast Asian cultural context may provide an effective means to promote the mental well-being of adolescents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Mental Health Problems; Parent-adolescent Bonding; School Bullying; Vietnam; Adolescent; Bullying; Child; Child Parent Relation; Epidemiology; Female; Health Survey; Human; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; School; Student; Suicidal Ideation; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Bullying; Child; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; Parent-child Relations; Parents; Schools; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Vietnam","adolescent; bullying; child; child parent relation; epidemiology; female; health survey; human; loneliness; male; mental health; school; student; suicidal ideation; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Bullying; Child; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Schools; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Vietnam","","","This work is partly supported by Japanese Society for Promotion of Science Grant (17H02164).","World Health Organization Mental Health Action Plan 2013 2020 2013; Cash, Scottye J., Epidemiology of youth suicide and suicidal behavior, Current Opinion in Pediatrics, 21, 5, pp. 613-619, (2009); Blum, Robert Wm, Youth at risk: Suicidal thoughts and attempts in Vietnam, China, and Taiwan, Journal of Adolescent Health, 50, 3 SUPPL., pp. S37-S44, (2012); Peltzer, Karl K., Suicidal behaviors and associated factors among university students in six countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Asian Journal of Psychiatry, 26, pp. 32-38, (2017); Nguyen, Dat Tan, Perspectives of pupils, parents, and teachers on mental health problems among Vietnamese secondary school pupils, BMC Public Health, 13, 1, (2013); Int Perspect Psychol, (2014); Le, Minh T.H., Experience of low mood and suicidal behaviors among adolescents in vietnam: findings from two national population-based surveys, Journal of Adolescent Health, 51, 4, pp. 339-348, (2012); Nguyen, Dat Tan, Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among Vietnamese secondary school students and proposed solutions: A cross-sectional study, BMC Public Health, 13, 1, (2013); Cosma, Alina Paula, Trends in bullying victimization in Scottish adolescents 1994–2014: changing associations with mental well-being, International Journal of Public Health, 62, 6, pp. 639-646, (2017); Schneider, Shari Kessel, Cyberbullying, school bullying, and psychological distress: A regional census of high school students, American Journal of Public Health, 102, 1, pp. 171-177, (2012)","","BioMed Central Ltd. info@biomedcentral.com","","","","","","20507283","","","30885261","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063132112"

Inspired by this computational movement, this study uses Bayesian networks analysis, combining both the frequentist and the Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, to investigate the highly representative elements in the cultural evolution of a Vietnamese city's architecture in the early 20th century. With a focus on the façade design of 68 old houses in Hanoi's Old Quarter (based on 248 photos and 78 data lines), the study argues that it is plausible to look at the aesthetics, architecture, and designs of the house façade to find traces of cultural evolution in Vietnam, which went through more than six decades of French colonization and centuries of sociocultural influence from China. The in-depth technical analysis, though refuting the presumed model on the probabilistic dependency among the variables, yields several results, the most notable of which is the strong influence of Buddhism over the decorations of the house façade. Particularly, in the top 5 networks with the best Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scores and small p-values, the variable for decorations (DC) always has a direct probabilistic dependency on the variable B for Buddhism. The paper then discusses these findings and suggests integrating Bayesian statistics in social sciences in general and for studies of cultural evolution and architectural transformation in particular. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Network; Buddhism; Cultural Evolution; Franco-chinese Style; French Colonialism; Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Hanoi Architecture; House Façade; Old Quarter","","","","","Ecole Superieure Des Beaux Arts De Lindochine, (2016); Blackmore, Susan J., Why we need memetics, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29, 4, pp. 349-350, (2006); Proceedings of the British Academy, (1996); Culture and the Evolutionary Process, (1985); Hanoi Painting, (2012); Bui Xuan Phai Cuoc Di Va Tac Pham, (1998); Encyclopedia of Buddhism, (2004); Cultural Transmission and Evolution A Quantitative Approach, (1981); Chiung, Wi Vun Taiffalo, Language, literacy, and nationalism: Taiwan's orthographic transition from the perspective of Han sphere, Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 28, 2, pp. 102-116, (2007); Kien Truc Dan Gian Truyen Thong Viet Nam Vietnam S Traditional Folk Architecture, (2003)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","25902911","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072597906"

Here, we focus on the Human-scale development (HSD) theory proposed by Chilean economist Max-Neef, in which the following nine fundamental needs are introduced: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, idleness, creation, identity, and freedom. In HSD, an important role is played by satisfiers, which are ways of fulfilling the above-mentioned fundamental needs in a particular context, such as climate and culture. From the standpoint of a producer, satisfiers are regarded as the starting points of product development for SCP. This paper introduces the opposite concept, referred to as a barrier—a factor that interferes with fulfilling fundamental needs. The purpose of this paper is to determine the satisfiers and barriers for younger people in Vietnam based on the results of needs-based workshops. Around 1200 satisfiers and barriers were extracted; however, barriers were largely equivalent to satisfiers. We found that the concept of satisfiers is useful to achieve SCP, because it is comprehensive, realistic, and provides an opportunity for social practice. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human Scale Development (hsd); Living-sphere Approach; Satisfier; Sustainable Consumption And Production (scp); Manufacture; Human Needs; Living-sphere Approach; Satisfier; Scale Development; Social Practices; Sustainable Consumption; Viet Nam; Sustainable Development","Manufacture; Human needs; Living-sphere approach; Satisfier; Scale development; Social practices; Sustainable consumption; Viet Nam; Sustainable development","","","Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-16) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency.

The purpose of this work is to study the characteristic of variable polarity plasma arc pressure with different polarity time and find the key fact to achieve welding process stability and good quality welding joint in the flat position. The arc shape variation, arc pressure evolution and the molten pool behavior were observed and measured to discover the relationship to the weld joint formation. It was found that the small plasma arc pressure in the center with a similar affected region and enough upward shear force of arc plasma are the necessary conditions to get a stable keyhole process, which could drive the liquid metal of the back side weld pool converges at the bottom of the keyhole and flows upward and form a high-quality weld bead. Comparing the welding stability and quality, adjusting polarity time is the good method for completing the necessary conditions. With the variable polarity time decreasing, the stable keyholes process and acceptable weld quality were obtained in the flat position. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aluminum Alloy; Flat Keyhole Welding; Keyhole Stability; Plasma Arc Pressure; Vppa Welding; Aluminum Alloys; Electric Welding; Laser Beam Welding; Plasma Stability; Plasma Torches; Shear Flow; Welds; High Quality Welds; Influence Mechanism; Keyhole Welding; Plasma Arc; Variable Polarity; Variable Polarity Plasma Arc; Welding Process; Welding Stability; Plasma Welding","Aluminum alloys; Electric welding; Laser beam welding; Plasma stability; Plasma torches; Shear flow; Welds; High quality welds; Influence mechanism; Keyhole welding; Plasma arc; Variable polarity; Variable polarity plasma arc; Welding process; Welding stability; Plasma welding","","","Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51875004 ); National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2014zx04001-171 ); State Key Lab of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology ( AWJ-16-M06 ); And supported by the China Scholarship Council for 1 year study at Osaka University.","Welding Handbook, (1991); Zhang, Y.

Comparing with current approaches, generated test cases within our approach contain more detailed information including test steps, test objects within steps, actions of test objects, and test data.

Suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence has been linked to subsequent missed visits. Knowing the determinants of missed visits in Asian patients will allow for appropriate counselling and intervention strategies to ensure continuous engagement in care. A missed visit was defined as having no assessments within six months. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to analyse factors associated with missed visits. A total of 7100 patients were included from 12 countries in Asia with 2676 (37.7%) having at least one missed visit. Patients with early suboptimal self-reported adherence <95% were more likely to have a missed visit compared to those with adherence ≥95% (OR = 2.55, 95% CI(1.81–3.61)). Other factors associated with having a missed visit were homosexual (OR = 1.45, 95%CI(1.27–1.66)) and other modes of HIV exposure (OR = 1.48, 95%CI(1.27–1.74)) compared to heterosexual exposure; using PI-based (OR = 1.33, 95%CI(1.15–1.53) and other ART combinations (OR = 1.79, 95%CI(1.39–2.32)) compared to NRTI+NNRTI combinations; and being hepatitis C co-infected (OR = 1.27, 95%CI(1.06–1.52)). Patients aged >30 years (31–40 years OR = 0.81, 95%CI(0.73–0.89); 41–50 years OR = 0.73, 95%CI(0.64–0.83); and >50 years OR = 0.77, 95%CI(0.64–0.93)); female sex (OR = 0.81, 95%CI(0.72–0.90)); and being from upper middle (OR = 0.78, 95%CI(0.70–0.80)) or high-income countries (OR = 0.42, 95%CI(0.35–0.51)), were less likely to have missed visits. Almost 40% of our patients had a missed clinic visit. Early ART adherence was an indicator of subsequent clinic visits. Intensive counselling and adherence support should be provided at ART initiation in order to optimise long-term clinic attendance and maximise treatment outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adherence; Asia; Hiv; Missed Visit; Anti-hiv Agents; Anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus Agent; Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor; Rna Directed Dna Polymerase Inhibitor; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Antiretroviral Therapy; Article; Cambodia; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; China; Female; Follow Up; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Heterosexuality; High Income Country; Homosexuality; Hong Kong; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; India; Indonesia; Japan; Long Term Care; Major Clinical Study; Malaysia; Male; Middle Income Country; Mixed Infection; Patient Attitude; Patient Compliance; Philippines; Priority Journal; Singapore; South Korea; Taiwan; Thailand; Treatment Outcome; Treatment Response; Viet Nam; Asia; Income; Medication Compliance; Middle Aged; Organization And Management; Outpatient Department; Secondary Prevention; Self Report; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Anti-hiv Agents; Female; Hiv Infections; Humans; Income; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Secondary Prevention; Self Report","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; adult; ambulatory care; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Cambodia; CD4 lymphocyte count; China; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; heterosexuality; high income country; homosexuality; Hong Kong; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; India; Indonesia; Japan; long term care; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle income country; mixed infection; patient attitude; patient compliance; Philippines; priority journal; Singapore; South Korea; Taiwan; Thailand; treatment outcome; treatment response; Viet Nam; Asia; income; medication compliance; middle aged; organization and management; outpatient department; secondary prevention; self report; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Anti-HIV Agents; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Income; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Secondary Prevention; Self Report","","Anti-HIV Agents","The TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database is an initiative of TREAT Asia, a program of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, with support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as part of the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA; U01AI069907).

This interdisciplinary study contributes to the literature through its application of Bayesian statistics in analyzing Vietnamese folklore. By breaking down 307 stories in popular Vietnamese folktales and major story collections and categorizing their core messages under the values or anti-values of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, the study shows how the Bayesian method helps discover an underlying behavioural phenomenon called “cultural additivity.” The term, which is inspired by the principle of additivity in probability, adds to the voluminous works on syncretism, creolization and hybridity in its technical dimension. Here, to evaluate how the values and norms of the aforementioned three religions (“tam giáo” 三教) co-exist, interact, and influence Vietnamese society, the study proposes three models of additivity for religious faiths: (a) no additivity, (b) simple additivity, and (c) complex additivity. The empirical results confirm the existence of “cultural additivity” : not only is there an isolation of Buddhism in the folktales, there is also a higher possibility of interaction or addition of Confucian and Taoist values even when these two religions hold different value systems (β <inf>{VT.VC}</inf> = 0.86). The arbitrary blend of the three religions is an example of the observed phenomenon of Vietnamese people selecting and adding ideas, beliefs, or artefacts—which may sometimes appear contradictory to principles of their existing beliefs—to their culture. The behavioural pattern is omnipresent in the sense that it can also be seen in Vietnamese arts, architecture, or adoption of new ideas and religions, among others. The “cultural additivity” concept, backed by robust statistical analysis, is an attempt to fill in the cultural core pointed out by syncretism and account for the rising complexity of modern societies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank research staff at Vuong & Associates for assistance in collecting and preparing dataset, particularly Dam Thu Ha and Nghiem Phu Kien Cuong.

This study uses data on propensity of general health exam (GHE) spending to show that despite the debate on the necessity of GHE, its objective is clear—to obtain more information and certainty about one’s health so as to minimise future risks. Most studies on this topic, however, focus only on factors associated with GHE uptake and overlook the shifts in behaviours and attitudes regarding different levels of cost. To fill the gap, this study analyses a dataset of 2068 subjects collected from Hanoi (Vietnam) and its vicinities using the baseline-category logit method. We evaluate the sensitivity of Vietnamese healthcare consumers against two groups of factors (demographic and socioeconomic-cognitive) regarding payment for periodic GHE, which is not covered by insurance. Our study shows that uninsured, married and employed individuals are less sensitive to cost than their counterparts because they value the information in reducing future health uncertainty. The empirical results challenge the objections to periodic health screening by highlighting its utility. The relevance of behavioural economics is further highlighted through a look at the bounded rationality of healthcare consumers and private insurance companies in using and providing the service, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Agborsangaya, Calypse B., Multimorbidity prevalence and patterns across socioeconomic determinants: a cross-sectional survey., BMC Public Health, 12, (2012); Agee, Mark D., Lessons from game theory about healthcare system price inflation: Evidence from a community-level case study, Applied Health Economics and Health Policy, 11, 1, pp. 45-51, (2013); Categorical Data Analysis, (2002); Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data, (1984); Becker, Marshall H., The Health Belief Model and Sick Role Behavior, Health Education and Behavior, 2, 4, pp. 409-419, (1977); Boulware, L.

In particular, sliding window automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols are designed so that the window size is determined by the burst duration. This facilitates an effective operation of sliding window protocols with the adaptive rate (AR) transmission over the strong atmospheric turbulence channels. To analyze the performance of the design, the time-varying behavior of the atmospheric turbulence channels, modeled the popular Gamma-Gamma (ΓΓ) distribution, is captured by a finite Markov chain. The channel model is then used to develop the burst error model for the cross-layer performance analysis of sliding window protocol with AR transmission. Numerical results quantitatively demonstrate the impact of atmospheric turbulence on the system performance, and support the optimal selection of system parameters over turbulence conditions. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed to validate the analytical results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Thermodynamics; Error Correction; Intelligent Systems; Markov Processes; Mobile Telecommunication Systems; Monte Carlo Methods; Atmospheric Turbulence Channels; Automatic Repeat Request Protocols; Error Control Protocols; Finite Markov Chain; Performance Analysis; Sliding Window Protocol; Time Varying Behavior; Turbulence Conditions; Atmospheric Turbulence","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Error correction; Intelligent systems; Markov processes; Mobile telecommunication systems; Monte Carlo methods; Atmospheric turbulence channels; Automatic repeat request protocols; Error control protocols; Finite Markov chain; Performance analysis; Sliding window protocol; Time varying behavior; Turbulence conditions; Atmospheric turbulence","","","","Kaushal, Hemani, Optical Communication in Space: Challenges and Mitigation Techniques, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 19, 1, pp. 57-96, (2017); Abou-Rjeily, Chadi, Cooperative diversity for free-space optical communications: Transceiver design and performance analysis, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 59, 3, pp. 658-663, (2011); Djordjević, Ivan Bivan, Adaptive modulation and coding for free-space optical channels, Journal of Optical Communications and Networking, 2, 5, pp. 221-229, (2010); Kiasaleh, Kamran, Hybrid ARQ for FSO communications through turbulent atmosphere, IEEE Communications Letters, 14, 9, pp. 866-868, (2010); Aghajanzadeh, Sahar Molla, Information theoretic analysis of hybrid-ARQ protocols in coherent free-space optical systems, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 60, 5, pp. 1432-1442, (2012); Parthasarathy, Swaminathan, Adaptive HARQ with Channel State Information in Inter-HAP FSO Links, pp. 51-56, (2017); Mai, Vuong V., Cross-layer designs and analysis of adaptive-rate transmission and ARQ for free-space optical communications, IEEE Photonics Journal, 8, 1, (2016); Kazemi, Hossein, Outage analysis of hybrid FSO/RF systems based on finite-state Markov chain modeling, pp. 11-15, (2014); Yun, Jungnam, Markov error structure for throughput analysis of adaptive modulation systems combined with ARQ over correlated fading channels, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 54, 1, pp. 235-245, (2005); Vetelino, Frida Strömqvist, Fade statistics and aperture averaging for Gaussian beam waves in moderate-to-strong turbulence, Applied Optics, 46, 18, pp. 3780-3789, (2007)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence, ICTC 2018","","Jeju Island; Maison Glad Jeju","142722","","9781538650400","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059467956"

In this paper, we use a multi-stream framework which is a combination of separated networks with different kinds of input generated from a unique video dataset. We study various methods for extracting best frames in videos for action representation and find the way to fuse multiple networks for better recognition. We make the following work: first, we propose a method to extract the active frames (called Selected Active Frames - SAF) from videos to build datasets for 3DCNNs in video classification problem. Secondly, we propose a mixed fusing approach called Vote fusion which is considered as an effective fusion method for ensembling multi-stream networks. We evaluate the proposed approach to solving action recognition problem. We carry out this approach on three well-known datasets (KTH, HMDB51, and UCF101).

In this study, we considered mental workload from a secondary task as a potential source of cognitive distraction and aimed to estimate the increased cognitive load on the driver with a four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device by introducing a machine-learning method for hemodynamic data. To produce added cognitive workload in a driver beyond just driving, two levels of an auditory presentation n-back task were used. A total of 60 experimental data sets from the NIRS device during two driving tasks were obtained and analyzed by machine-learning algorithms. We used two techniques to prevent overfitting of the classification models: (1) k-fold cross-validation and principal-component analysis, and (2) retaining 25% of the data (testing data) for testing of the model after classification. Six types of classifier were trained and tested: decision tree, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, the support vector machine, the nearest neighbor classifier, and the ensemble classifier. Cognitive workload levels were well classified from the NIRS data in the cases of subject-dependent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 81.30 to 95.40%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data was 82.18 to 96.08%), subject 26 independent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 84.90 to 89.50%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data increased from 84.08 to 89.91%), and channel-independent classification (classification 82.90%, prediction 82.74%). NIRS data in conjunction with an artificial intelligence method can therefore be used to classify mental workload as a source of potential cognitive distraction in real time under naturalistic conditions; this information may be utilized in driver assistance systems to prevent road accidents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Classification; Cognitive Distraction; Driver Attention; Mental Workload; Near-infrared Spectroscopy; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Attention; Decision Tree; Discriminant Analysis; Driver; Hemodynamics; Human; Human Experiment; N-back Test; Near Infrared Spectroscopy; Prediction; Principal Component Analysis; Support Vector Machine; Traffic Accident; Validation Process; Workload","article; artificial intelligence; attention; decision tree; discriminant analysis; driver; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; n-back test; near infrared spectroscopy; prediction; principal component analysis; support vector machine; traffic accident; validation process; workload","","","This study was partially supported by DENSO CORPORATION and by the Center of Innovation Program (Nagoya University COI: Mobility Innovation Center) from Japan Science and Technology Agency.","Abdelnour, Farras, Real-time imaging of human brain function by near-infrared spectroscopy using an adaptive general linear model, NeuroImage, 46, 1, pp. 133-143, (2009); Aghajani, Haleh, Measuring mental workload with EEG+fNIRS, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 11, (2017); Driver Workload Metrics Task 2 Final Report, (2006); Identification of Cognitive Load in Naturalistic Driving, (2015); J Transp Technol, (2017); Le, Anh Son, Effect of mental workload and aging on driver distraction based on the involuntary eye movement, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 484, pp. 349-359, (2017); Futur Act Saf Technol Towar Zero Traffic Accid Conf, (2017); Le, Anh Son, Towards online detection of driver distraction: Eye-movement simulation based on a combination of vestibulo–ocular reflex and optokinetic reflex models, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 65, pp. 716-729, (2019); Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference University Village, (2016); Proceedings of the 2017 Japan Society Automotive Engineers Annual Congress, (2017)","","Frontiers Media S.A. info@frontiersin.org","","","","","","16625161","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056851514"

Next, an evaluation index system is established by combining the fundamental qualitative characteristics and the enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful financial information. Then, to overcome the weighting difficulties and achieve maximum consensus, this paper applies a distance-based method to determine the evaluators’ weights and a weighted averaging operator to compute the criteria weights. After that, a TOPSIS-based aggregation method is applied to aggregate all ratings. Finally, a practical example of an economic group’s FSQ evaluation is provided, and then this method is compared with other current methods to demonstrate its flexibility further. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assessing Attitude; Financial Statement Quality; Group Decision Making; Hesitant Fuzzy; Multi-criteria Decision Making; Weight Determination","","","","This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71601134]; the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2017M612983]; the Research Center for Systems Science & Enterprise Development [grant number Xq15C01].","Quality of Financial Reporting Measuring Qualitative Characteristics, (2009); Boschetti, Fabio, Assessing attitudes and cognitive styles of stakeholders in environmental projects involving computer modelling, Ecological Modelling, 247, pp. 98-111, (2012); Clatworthy, Mark A., The timeliness of UK private company financial reporting: Regulatory and economic influences, British Accounting Review, 48, 3, pp. 297-315, (2016); Dursun, Mehtap, A fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making framework for evaluating health-care waste disposal alternatives, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 9, pp. 11453-11462, (2011); Financial Accounting and Reporting, (2011); Feng, Bo, Multi-attribute group decision making with aspirations: A case study, Omega (United Kingdom), 44, pp. 136-147, (2014); Habib, Ahsan, Corporate governance and financial reporting quality in China: A survey of recent evidence, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 24, pp. 29-45, (2015); He, Xiaorong, Exploring the Ordered Weighted Averaging Operator Knowledge Domain: A Bibliometric Analysis, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 32, 11, pp. 1151-1166, (2017); Advances in Accounting Incorporating Advances in International Accounting; Iatridis, George Emmanuel, International Financial Reporting Standards and the quality of financial statement information, International Review of Financial Analysis, 19, 3, pp. 193-204, (2010)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","17509661; 17509653","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041823232"

In Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, the situation of groundwater resources is disastrous because the quality has seriously degraded recently. Hence, in this study, a social sustainability assessment framework of groundwater resources with a focus on Hanoi is proposed for the first time. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach was used to generate the main components (aspects and indicators) of this framework, which has been considered one of the most challenging tasks in AHP sustainability applications. To overcome these challenging tasks, we carefully reviewed and explored the current problems of Hanoi groundwater resources to propose 3 main aspects (quantity, quality, and management) and appropriately selected their 13 sustainability indicators for this target area. We introduce a sustainability index function (SIF) for indicators to clarify the relationship between each indicator value and its sustainability index. Furthermore, we consider both the conventional linear relationship, as it is usually developed in the literature, as well as a non-linear SIF to arrive at a reasonable sustainability assessment. For the Hanoi case study, the sustainability indices obtained using a combined linear and non-linear SIF method reflect the current problems well, that is, the social sustainability assessment is closer to reality. The sustainability indices of the quantity, quality, and management aspects of the groundwater were appropriately assessed as good, poor, and acceptable, respectively, resulting in Hanoi being rated at the acceptable level in the final social sustainability assessment. This result reveals that the population of Hanoi is satisfied with the quantity of water but dissatisfied with its current poor quality and its relatively high price. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahp; Groundwater; Hanoi; Indicator; Social Sustainability Assessment; Sustainability Index Function; Groundwater Resources; Hierarchical Systems; Sustainable Development; Water Management; Water Supply; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Case-studies; Hanoi; Index Functions; Social Sustainability; Social Sustainability Assessment; Sustainability Assessment; Sustainability Index; Sustainability Index Function; Viet Nam; Groundwater; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Environmental Indicator; Groundwater; Index Method; Resource Assessment; Sustainability; Water Management; Water Resource; Water Supply","Groundwater resources; Hierarchical systems; Sustainable development; Water management; Water supply; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Case-studies; Hanoi; Index functions; Social sustainability; Social sustainability assessment; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability index; Sustainability index function; Viet Nam; Groundwater; analytical hierarchy process; environmental indicator; groundwater; index method; resource assessment; sustainability; water management; water resource; water supply","","","This study was carried out as a part of the research project “Study on guerrilla rainstorms, flood inundation and water pollution in metropolitan watersheds” supported by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Japan (represented by A.

The protocol is based on the conventional M-ary collision tree (MCT) where tags involving a collision are classified into other M sub-trees. Nevertheless, different from the MCT, we design a transmission mechanism by which each tag only responds to the reader by a small number of bits for a collision detection. The mechanism is relied on a collision window and Manchester encoding that are widely used for RFID systems. Thanks to the mechanism, the number of bits transmitted by tags is significantly reduced, which improves the overall system performance in terms of both time and energy consumption. Performance analysis is investigated to validate the correctness of the mechanism. Computer simulations are also performed using Monte-Carlo method. The obtained results are then compared with those of the MCT to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dense Rfid; Energy-efficient; Identification; Manchester Encoding; Time-efficient; Encoding (symbols); Energy Utilization; Forestry; Identification (control Systems); Monte Carlo Methods; Radio Frequency Identification (rfid); Signal Encoding; Collision Detection; Energy Efficient; Identification Protocol; Manchester Encoding; Performance Analysis; Tag Identification; Time-efficient; Transmission Mechanisms; Energy Efficiency","Encoding (symbols); Energy utilization; Forestry; Identification (control systems); Monte Carlo methods; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Signal encoding; Collision detection; Energy efficient; Identification protocol; Manchester encoding; Performance analysis; Tag identification; Time-efficient; Transmission mechanisms; Energy efficiency","","","This work is supported by Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology under the project DTDLCN.36/17.","Bolić, Miodrag D., RFID Systems: Research Trends and Challenges, (2010); Al-Fuqaha, Ala Isam, Internet of Things: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Protocols, and Applications, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 17, 4, pp. 2347-2376, (2015); Finkenzeller, Klaus, RFID Handbook: Fundamentals and Applications in Contactless Smart Cards, Radio Frequency Identification and near-Field Communication, (2010); Nguyen, Chuyen T., Modified tree-based identification protocols for solving hidden-tag problem in RFID systems over fading channels, IET Communications, 11, 7, pp. 1132-1142, (2017); Chin, Kwan Wu, Aloha-Based Protocols, pp. 179-202, (2010); Namboodiri, Vinod, Energy-aware tag anticollision protocols for RFID systems, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 9, 1, pp. 44-59, (2010); Lai, Yuancheng Lai, A novel query tree protocol with bit tracking in RFID tag identification, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 12, 10, pp. 2063-2075, (2013); Jia, Xiaolin, An efficient anti-collision protocol for RFID tag identification, IEEE Communications Letters, 14, 11, pp. 1014-1016, (2010); Su, Jian, A Time Efficient Tag Identification Algorithm Using Dual Prefix Probe Scheme (DPPS), IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 23, 3, pp. 386-389, (2016); Zhang, Lijuan, Assigned tree slotted aloha RFID tag anti-collision protocols, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 12, 11, pp. 5493-5505, (2013)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Antenna and Propagation Society (APS); IEEE Photonics Society","7th IEEE International Conference on Communications and Electronics, ICCE 2018","","Hue; Saigon Morin Hotel","141951","","9781538636787","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057609262"

Nevertheless, 360 VR video transmission consumes a huge bandwidth. Besides, how to reduce the delay of 360 VR video streaming is another problem. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we introduce an efficient adaptive 360 VR video streaming method over HTTP/2 using stream priority and stream termination features. To support adaptivity, a 360 VR video is divided into multiple faces and each face is chunked into temporal segments. The video is also stored at the server with different levels of quality. In our method, we focus on the low delay scenario and thus all faces are downloaded simultaneously by using priority feature of HTTP/2 and the client decodes them based on the Group of Pictures (GOP). If the bandwidth suddenly drops, the client will break the simultaneity and inform the server to push consecutively the faces based on their priorities. In addition, stream termination feature can be used to terminate the media parts, which will miss the deadline. The experimental results show that, when the initial buffer is set to 0.5s, there is only 0.08% of the number of GOPs in the front face that miss the deadline in our proposed method, compared to the values of 0.75% and 3.34% of two reference methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Http Adaptive Streaming; Http/2; Stream Priority; Stream Termination.; Virtual Reality; Vr Video Streaming; Bandwidth; Http; Image Coding; Image Communication Systems; Virtual Reality; Group Of Pictures; Http Adaptive Streaming; Multimedia Applications; Stream Priority; Stream Termination; Temporal Segments; Video Streaming Over Http; Video Transmissions; Video Streaming","Bandwidth; HTTP; Image coding; Image communication systems; Virtual reality; Group of pictures; Http adaptive streaming; Multimedia applications; Stream priority; Stream termination; Temporal segments; Video streaming over http; Video transmissions; Video streaming","","","","Virtual Reality Market by Component Hardware and Software Technology Non Immersive Semi Fully Immersive Device Type Head Mounted Display Gesture Control Device Application and Geography Global Forecast to 2022, (2017); Tran, Huyen T.T., A subjective study on QoE of 360 video for VR communication, 2017-January, pp. 1-6, (2017); Virtual Reality VR and 360 Videos 101 A Beginner S Guide, (2016); Youtubes Ready to Blow Your Mind with 360 Degree Videos; Internet Connection Speed Recommendations; Nguyen, Minh Ngoc, An adaptive streaming method of 360 videos over HTTP/2 protocol, 2017-January, pp. 302-307, (2017); Average Global Mobile Network Connection Speeds from 2016 to 2021 in Mbps, (2018); Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 Http 2, (2015); Huysegems, Rafael, HTTP/2-based methods to improve the live experience of adaptive streaming, pp. 541-550, (2015); Cong-Thang, Truong, Adaptive streaming of audiovisual content using MPEG DASH, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 58, 1, pp. 78-85, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Antenna and Propagation Society (APS); IEEE Photonics Society","7th IEEE International Conference on Communications and Electronics, ICCE 2018","","Hue; Saigon Morin Hotel","141951","","9781538636787","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057607435"

We have been working for the target temporal resolution of nanosecond order. Then, we named the image sensor »Nano-Second Image Sensor» or »NanoSIS». In the sensor, incident light arrives the sensor on the backside and generates signal electrons. The signals electrons travel to the front side on which five collection gates and a drain gate are placed like petals of a flower of the pixel. At a certain time, the signal electrons are collected by one of the collection gates in turn. The temporal resolution of the sensor is limited by the variation of the travel time of signal electrons. The test sensor is fabricated and under evaluation. The frame rate of 100 Mfps or the temporal resolution of 10 ns is successfully achieved. The sensor can capture 5 consecutive frames with 600 kpixels or 10 consecutive frames with 300 kpixels.

However, this scheme leads to two serious problems: data concentration around the hole boundaries and routing path enlargement. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to address these two problems, wherein a common idea is to form forbidden areas around the holes from which packets are kept to stay away. Unfortunately, most of the protocols proposed so far address only special cases where either the network contains only one hole or the sources and the destinations stay fairly far from the holes. In this paper, we focus on the general case where the network may contain multiple holes and the sources/destinations may stay in the vicinity of the holes. We then propose a hole bypassing protocol which can balance the traffic over the network while ensuring the constant stretch property of the routing path. The theoretical analysis proves that the routing path stretch of the proposed protocol can be controlled to be as small as 1+\epsilon (for any predefined \epsilon\gt0), and the simulation experiments show that our protocol strongly outperforms state-of-the-art protocols in terms of load balancing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disaster Prevention; Hole Concentration; Internet Protocols; Network Routing; Wireless Sensor Networks; Data Concentration; Disaster Management; External Force; Forward Packets; Multiple Holes; Problem Datum; Routing Holes; Routing Path; Routings; Sensor Network Routing; Disasters","Disaster prevention; Hole concentration; Internet protocols; Network routing; Wireless sensor networks; Data concentration; Disaster management; External force; Forward packets; Multiple holes; Problem datum; Routing holes; Routing path; Routings; Sensor network routing; Disasters","","","This work is supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16H02817.","Chen, Dan, Natural disaster monitoring with wireless sensor networks: A case study of data-intensive applications upon low-cost scalable systems, Mobile Networks and Applications, 18, 5, pp. 651-663, (2013); Erdelj, Milan, Wireless Sensor Networks and Multi-UAV systems for natural disaster management, Computer Networks, 124, pp. 72-86, (2017); IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, (2017); Bhosle, Anand S., Forest disaster management with wireless sensor network, pp. 287-289, (2016); Karp, Brad, GPSR: Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing for wireless networks, Proceedings of the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MOBICOM, pp. 243-254, (2000); Trajcevski, Goce, Bypassing holes in sensor networks: Load-balance vs. latency, (2011); Chang, Guey Yun, A hole avoiding routing protocol in wireless sensor networks, pp. 75-79, (2014); Won, Myounggyu, GOAL: A parsimonious geographic routing protocol for large scale sensor networks, Ad Hoc Networks, 11, 1, pp. 453-472, (2013); Nguyen, Phile, Load balanced routing with constant stretch for wireless sensor network with holes, (2014); Won, Myounggyu, A low-stretch-guaranteed and lightweight geographic routing protocol for large-scale wireless sensor networks, ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks, 11, 1, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Disaster Management, ICT-DM 2018","","Sendai","144955","","9781538666388","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062840373"

This preference largely emerges from the relative convenience in data collection and quantification of these approaches, collectively accrue to practitioners’ beliefs that unless explicitly quantified and monetized, these benefits will be negligible. Social aspects of ecosystems contributions to human well-being, on the other hand, are comparatively harder to grasp, thus predominantly overlooked in the general assessment of ES and EDS. To alleviate this imbalance, we presented a case study in exploring relevant ES and EDS within the context of a protected area using non-monetary methods with the aid of the local community. In particular, through deliberative mapping approach, the manuscript strived to locate, quantify, and assess a full range of relevant ES and EDS as perceived by local inhabitants across the landscape of U Minh Thuong National Park (UMTNP), Vietnam. Within the scope of this paper, we also delved into how socio-cultural perceptions and preferences towards these natural resources diverge among groups of respondents. Through the presented research, we strived to consolidate the baseline understanding regarding the ES profile of the research area with relevant social insights, paving the way for the design and implementation of sustainable management strategies.

The study aimed to examine the factor structure and to explore the cross-cultural utility of the MHC-SF using bifactor models and exploratory structural equation modelling. Method: Using multigroup confirmatory analysis (MGCFA) we examined the measurement invariance of the MHC-SF in 38 countries (university students, N = 8,066; 61.73% women, mean age 21.55 years). Results: MGCFA supported the cross-cultural replicability of a bifactor structure and a metric level of invariance between student samples. The average proportion of variance explained by the general factor was high (ECV =.66), suggesting that the three aspects of mental health (emotional, social, and psychological well-being) can be treated as a single dimension of well-being. Conclusion: The metric level of invariance offers the possibility of comparing correlates and predictors of positive mental functioning across countries; however, the comparison of the levels of mental health across countries is not possible due to lack of scalar invariance. Our study has preliminary character and could serve as an initial assessment of the structure of the MHC-SF across different cultural settings. Further studies on general populations are required for extending our findings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-cultural Study; Measurement Invariance; Mental Health Continuum-short Form; Adolescent; Adult; Cultural Factor; Devices; Female; Global Health; Human; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Psychological Rating Scale; Psychometry; Satisfaction; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-cultural Comparison; Female; Global Health; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Young Adult","adolescent; adult; cultural factor; devices; female; global health; human; male; mental health; middle aged; psychological rating scale; psychometry; satisfaction; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Global Health; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Young Adult","","","The work of Jaros\u0142aw P.

This paper presents a framework which exploits the support of social context (user-generated content such as comments or tweets and third-party sources such as relevant documents retrieved from a search engine) to extract high-quality summaries. The extraction was formulated in two steps: sentence scoring and selection. The scoring is modeled as a learning to rank problem, which employs Ranking SVM to mutually exploits sentences, user-generated content, and third-party sources in the form of features to cover summary aspects. For the selection, summaries are extracted by using a score-based or voting method. For evaluation, three datasets of sentence and highlight extraction in two languages were taken as a case study.

The traditional approaches are based on machine learning, and software metrics obtained by computing standard measures of software projects. However, these methods have faced many challenges due to limitations of using software metrics which were not enough to capture the complexity of programs. To overcome the limitations, this paper aims to solve software engineering problems by exploring information of programs' abstract syntax trees (ASTs) instead of software metrics. We propose two combination models between a tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), support vector machines (SVMs) to exploit both structural and semantic ASTs' information. In addition, to deal with high-dimensional data of ASTs, we present several pruning tree techniques which not only reduce the complexity of data but also enhance the performance of classifiers in terms of computational time and accuracy. We survey many machine learning algorithms on different types of program representations including software metrics, sequences, and tree structures. The approaches are evaluated based on classifying 52000 programs written in C language into 104 target labels. The experiments show that the tree-based classifiers dramatically achieve high performance in comparison with those of metrics-based or sequences-based; and two proposed models TBCNN + SVM and TBCNN + kNN rank as the top and the second classifiers. Pruning redundant AST branches leads to not only a substantial reduction in execution time but also an increase in accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abtract Syntax Tree (ast); K-nearest Neighbors (knn); Support Vector Machines (svms); Tree-based Convolutional Neural Networks(tbcnn); Clustering Algorithms; Codes (symbols); Complex Networks; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Cost Engineering; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Motion Compensation; Nearest Neighbor Search; Object Oriented Programming; Semantics; Software Engineering; Support Vector Machines; Syntactics; Trees (mathematics); High Dimensional Data; K Nearest Neighbor (knn); Performance Of Classifier; Program Representations; Support Vector Machine (svms); Syntax Tree; Traditional Approaches; Tree-based; C (programming Language)","Clustering algorithms; Codes (symbols); Complex networks; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cost engineering; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Object oriented programming; Semantics; Software engineering; Support vector machines; Syntactics; Trees (mathematics); High dimensional data; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Performance of classifier; Program representations; Support vector machine (SVMs); Syntax tree; Traditional approaches; Tree-based; C (programming language)","","","","Ugurel, Secil, What's the code?

The single models and k-means clustering are used to build the hybrid forecasting models in different levels of complexity (i.e. ARIMA; hybrid model of ARIMA and ANNs; and hybrid model of k-means, ARIMA, and ANN). To obtain the final forecasting value, the forecasted values of these three models are combined with the weights generated from the discount mean square forecast error (DMSFE) method. The proposed model is applied to three well-known data sets: Wolf's sunspot, Canadian lynx and the exchange rate (British pound to US dollar) to evaluate the prediction capability in three measures (i.e. MSE, MAE, and MAPE). In addition, the prediction performance of the proposed model is compared to ARIMA; ANNs; Khashei and Bijari's model; and the hybrid model of k-means, ARIMA, and ANN. The obtained results show that the proposed model gives the best performance in MSE, MAE, and MAPE for all three data sets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network (ann); Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (arima); Hybrid Model; K-means Clustering; Time Series Forecasting","","","","","Adhikari, Ratnadip, A combination of artificial neural network and random walk models for financial time series forecasting, Neural Computing and Applications, 24, 6, pp. 1441-1449, (2014); Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, (2001); Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Engineering Applications of Neural Networks Ceur Ws284, (2007); Bahrami, Saadat, Short term electric load forecasting by wavelet transform and grey model improved by PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm, Energy, 72, pp. 434-442, (2014); Benmouiza, Khalil, Forecasting hourly global solar radiation using hybrid k-means and nonlinear autoregressive neural network models, Energy Conversion and Management, 75, pp. 561-569, (2013); Box, George E.P., Time series analysis: Forecasting and control: Fourth edition, pp. 1-746, (2013); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A General, (1977); Co, Henry C., Forecasting Thailand's rice export: Statistical techniques vs. artificial neural networks, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 53, 4, pp. 610-627, (2007); De Gooijer, Jan G., 25 years of time series forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting, 22, 3, pp. 443-473, (2006); Deng, Weihui, A novel hybrid water quality time series prediction method based on cloud model and fuzzy forecasting, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 149, pp. 39-49, (2015)","","IGI Global cust@igi-global.com","","","","","","19478216; 19478208","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048331739"

In general, behavioral intention and habits explain the deliberate process and the habitual process of travelers’ behavior, respectively. While behavioral intention is considered as a goal-dependent deliberation, habits are not fully defined due to different views of researchers. The stimulus-response approach describes habits as a goal-independent automaticity, whereas the script-based approach views habits as a goal-dependent automaticity. The controversy in understanding the association between goals and habits necessitates a focus on the establishment of habits in which habits are assumed to appear due to a repetition of behavioral intention. With an aim to understand the process of transformation from intentions to habits, this study focuses on a mediated form of intention that is close to habits. It is hypothesized that the mediated form has characteristics similar to those of habits. Empirical support for the hypothesis was obtained in public transportation domain. The findings of this study are important for the field because they present a possibility that past research has investigated the mediated form of intention instead of habits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic Intention; Bus Service; Habit–intention Relation; Intention; Travel Behavior; Bus Transportation; Automatic Intention; Behavioral Intention; Bus Services; Intention; Public Transportation; Stimulus Response; Travel Behaviors; Transportation","Bus transportation; Automatic intention; Behavioral intention; Bus services; Intention; Public transportation; Stimulus response; Travel behaviors; Transportation","","","","Aarts, Henk J.M., Habits as knowledge structures: Automaticity in goal-directed behavior, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, 1, pp. 53-63, (2000); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen, Icek, Residual Effects of Past on Later Behavior: Habituation and Reasoned Action Perspectives, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6, 2, pp. 107-122, (2002); Attitudes Personality and Behavior, (2005); Ajzen, Icek, Attitudes and the Attitude-Behavior Relation: Reasoned and Automatic Processes, European Review of Social Psychology, 11, 1, pp. 1-33, (2000); Bamberg, Sebastian, Choice of Travel Mode in the Theory of Planned Behavior: The Roles of Past Behavior, Habit, and Reasoned Action, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 25, 3, pp. 175-187, (2003); Bamberg, Sebastian, Incentives, morality, or habit?

However, very few of them have targeted the distribution network operations in Japan. One of the operation methods used to maintain the supply-demand balance at the distribution network level is conservation voltage reduction (CVR), which is an operation method for reducing the active power consumption of the load demands by decreasing the sending end voltage at the distribution substation. Although CVR is a conventional operation method, it has gained much attention in the recent years owing to the emergence of smart meters. In this study, we focus on the applicability of CVR to Japanese distribution networks with large PV generations. First, we analyze the active power consumptions of the load demands and the transmission losses, by changing the sending end voltage at the substation and considering various load characteristics. Then, we evaluate the impact of the decrease in PV power output on the total active power consumption in the distribution network. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conservation Voltage Reduction (cvr); Distribution Network; Load Characteristic; Photovoltaic (pv) Generation; Electric Power Distribution; Electric Substations; Renewable Energy Resources; Active Power; Conservation Voltage Reduction; Conservation Voltage Reductions; Integration Of Renewable Energies; Load Characteristics; Load Demand; Operation Methods; Photovoltaics Generations; Power; Supply/demand Balance; Electric Power Utilization","Electric power distribution; Electric substations; Renewable energy resources; Active power; Conservation voltage reduction; Conservation voltage reductions; Integration of renewable energies; Load characteristics; Load demand; Operation methods; Photovoltaics generations; Power; Supply/demand balance; Electric power utilization","","","This work was partly supported by the Daiko Foundation (1-1-22, Daikou-minami, Higashi-ku, Nagoya 461-0047, Japan), Power Academy (1-3-2 Ootemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8118, Japan), and Meijo Asian Research Center (1-501 Shiogamaguchi, Tempaku-ku, Nagoya 468-8502, Japan).","Present Status and Promotion Measures for the Introduction of Renewable Energy in Japan; National Survey Report of Pv Power Applications in Japan 2007, (2008); Masuta, Taisuke, Impact of forecast error of photovoltaic power output on demand and supply operation in power systems, (2014); Ikeda, Yuichi, A unit commitment model with demand response for the integration of renewable energies, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, (2012); International Conference on Electrical Engineering, (2016); Masuta, Taisuke, Supplementary load frequency control by use of a number of both electric vehicles and heat pump water heaters, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 3, pp. 1253-1262, (2012); Fazelpour, Farivar, Intelligent optimization to integrate a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle smart parking lot with renewable energy resources and enhance grid characteristics, Energy Conversion and Management, 77, pp. 250-261, (2014); Brunner, Marc, PV curtailment reduction with smart homes and heat pumps, (2016); Evaluation of Conservation Voltage Reduction Cvr on A National Level, (2010); Bokhari, Abdullah, Combined Effect of CVR and DG Penetration in the Voltage Profile of Low-Voltage Secondary Distribution Networks, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 31, 1, pp. 286-293, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Lanka Electric Company (LECO) Pvt.

For large datasets, NMF performance depends on some major issues such as fast algorithms, fully parallel distributed feasibility and limited internal memory. This research designs a fast fully parallel and distributed algorithm using limited internal memory to reach high NMF performance for large datasets. Specially, we propose a flexible accelerated algorithm for NMF with all its L<inf>1</inf>L<inf>2</inf> regularized variants based on full decomposition, which is a combination of exact line search, greedy coordinate descent, and accelerated search. The proposed algorithm takes advantages of these algorithms to converges linearly at an over-bounded rate (1-μL)(1-μrL)2r in optimizing each factor matrix when fixing the other factor one in the sub-space of passive variables, where r is the number of latent components, and μ and L are bounded as 12≤μ≤L≤r.

It helps the patient and doctor keep frequent connection, so the quality of medical treatment is enhanced. Two main problems needed to be considered are the security and privacy of patient. Many schemes proposed to satisfy such requirements are not suitable for public medical environment because of their some limitations. For example, the patients identity and password are not protected; time-consuming computations in such schemes take a lot of time in authentication phase. In this paper, we survey some typical previous results in this area to inherit some advantages.

However, this traffic may significantly contend network resources with foreground (FG) traffic which conveys data/content to users. This contention directly affects the QoS and QoE of network services, specifically at the peak times. This paper proposes an integration approach to which delay-insensitive traffic is quickly detected and effectively transferred in accordance with the network conditions hence the best resources are yielded to FG traffic. For the traffic transferring, we propose two methods namely the router centric (RC) and the SDN-based approaches. In the RC method, the edge routers analyze network conditions, compute the suggested sending rates for individual traffic flows and send these values back to clients where the adjustment mechanisms are implemented. In the SDN-based method the course of actions for each traffic flow is computed by a remote controller. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Pollution Control; Quality Of Service; Remote Control; Adjustment Mechanisms; Individual Traffic; Integration Approach; Network Condition; Remote Controllers; System On Devices; Traffic Detection; Traffic Transferring; Routers","Pollution control; Quality of service; Remote control; Adjustment mechanisms; Individual traffic; Integration approach; Network condition; Remote controllers; System on Devices; Traffic detection; Traffic transferring; Routers","","","","Karla, Pramukh R., Identification of class of services in the Internet and a proposed approach to traffic prioritization at layer 3, Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON, (2012); Zhang, Jun, Internet traffic classification by aggregating correlated naive bayes predictions, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 8, 1, pp. 5-15, (2013); Zhang, Jun, Robust Network Traffic Classification, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 23, 4, pp. 1257-1270, (2015); Su, Kai, On the benefit of information centric networks for traffic engineering, pp. 3178-3184, (2014); Gobriel, Sameh, When idle is not quiet: Energy-efficient platform design in presence of network background and management traffic, (2010); Meng, Lei, Characterizing the utility of smartphone background traffic, Proceedings - International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, ICCCN, (2014); Tran-Minh, Quang, Separation of background and foreground traffic based on periodicity analysis, Proceedings - IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM, (2015); Low Extra Delay Background Transport Ledbat, (2012); Konda, Vishnu, RAPID: Shrinking the congestion-control timescale, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 1-9, (2009); Tsugawa, Tomoaki, Background TCP data transfer with Inline network measurement, 2005, pp. 459-463, (2005)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEICE ICM; KICS KNOM","18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium, APNOMS 2016","","Kanazawa; Kanazawa Chamber of Commerce and Industry","124900","","9784885523045","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006375008"

QM is divided into two dimensions: hard QM and soft QM. Quality performance as an intended consequence of QM implementation is also examined as a potential mediator between QM and innovation. A conceptual framework is developed to postulate causal linkages between soft/hard QM, quality performance, and innovation performance. Data collected from 283 plants in eight countries and a technique of structural equation modeling are used to test this framework. The results indicate different paths to innovation from different dimensions of QM. Hard QM affects innovation performance directly and indirectly through its effect on quality performance. Soft QM has indirect effect on innovation performance through its effect on hard QM. This means that quality performance depends directly on hard QM which can be promoted by soft QM. Quality performance shows a partial mediating effect on the relationship between hard QM and innovation performance. Quality and innovation are not a matter of trade-off, but they can coexist in a cumulative improvement model with quality as a foundation. Firms have no need to abandon QM endeavor to achieve innovation.

An adversary can collect these freely available messages and specifically analyze them for privacy leaks, such as the users’ location. Unlike other approaches that try to detect these leaks using complete message streams, we put forward a rule-based approach that works on single and very short messages to detect location leaks. We evaluated our approach based on 2817 tweets from the Tweets2011 data set. It scores significantly better (accuracy = 84.95%) on detecting whenever a message reveals the user’s location than a baseline using machine learning and three extensions using heuristic. Advantages of our approach are not only to apply for online social network messages but also to extend for other areas (such as email, military, health) and for other languages. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Location Leak; Online Social Network; Short Text Message; Artificial Intelligence; Information Systems; Learning Systems; Location; Online Systems; Websites; Data Set; Message Streams; On-line Social Networks; Rule-based Approach; Sensitive Informations; Short Message; Short Text Messages; Social Networking (online)","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Learning systems; Location; Online systems; Websites; Data set; Message streams; On-line social networks; Rule-based approach; Sensitive informations; Short message; Short text messages; Social networking (online)","","","","Finkel, Jenny Rose, Incorporating non-local information into information extraction systems by Gibbs sampling, pp. 363-370, (2005); Ritter, Alan L., Named entity recognition in tweets: An experimental study, pp. 1524-1534, (2011); Proceeddings of the 20th Text Retrieval Conference Trec 2011, (2011); Cheng, Zhiyuan, You are where you tweet: A content-based approach to geo-locating Twitter users, International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings, pp. 759-768, (2010); Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality, (2012); Amitay, Einat, Web-a-where: Geotagging Web content, pp. 273-280, (2004); Fink, Clay R., Geolocating blogs from their textual content, SS-09-08, pp. 25-26, (2009); Kitamoto, Asanobu, Toponym-based geotagging for observing precipitation from social and scientific data streams, pp. 23-26, (2012); Language Detection Library for Java, (2010); Han, Bo, Automatically constructing a normalisation dictionary for microblogs, pp. 421-432, (2012)","Abramowicz, W.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","Institute for Applied Informatics (InfAI); OpenLink Software for supporting the workshop","International Workshops on Business Information Systems Workshops, BIS 2015","","Poznan","158479","18651348; 18651356","9783032045119; 9783642357015; 9783030057664; 9783031602597; 9783662471562; 9783319741604; 9783031616563; 9783031161674; 3642018556; 9783642280818","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952653231"

The 2009 India Code of Corporate Governance also revealed that during the crisis time, there are certain weaknesses although corporate structure is fairly durable. Hence, this paper chooses a different analytical approach and among its aims is to give some systematic opinions. First, it classifies limited South Asian representative corporate governance (CG) standards into two (2) groups: India and Malaysia latest CG principles covered in group 1 and, group 2, including corporate governance principle from Thailand and Indonesia, so-called relative good CG group, while it uses ACCA and OECD and ICGN principles as reference. Second, it, through analysis, identifies differences and advantages between above set of standards which are and have been used as reference principles for many relevant organizations. Third, it establishes a selected comparative set of standards for South Asian representative corporate governance system in accordance to international standards.

Data were collected from 1118 respondents in Japan, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The dependent variable was the intention to use one of three modes for work travel after getting a job: car, public transit, or other modes. The explanatory variables were three attitude factors taken from a previous study, including: 1/symbolic affective, reflecting affective motives of travel mode use; 2/instrumental, referring to functional attributes of travel modes; and 3/social orderliness which represents for environmental friendliness, safety, altruism, quietness et cetera. Several logit model estimates were made using the samples from the six countries separately and together. We obtained three main findings. First, attitude variables about the car were all significant determinants for the entire sample from Asian countries. Second, the social orderliness aspect of public transit was a common concern of respondents from developing countries in selecting this mode for work trips. Third, in countries in which the intent to use a car was not very high, attitude factors about the car were found to be significant determinants of the behavioral intention to commute by car but were less significant in countries in which the desire to use a car was high. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes Toward Travel Modes; Commuting Mode Choice; Mobility Management; Psychological Methods; Developing Countries; Logistic Regression; Commuting Modes; Environmental Friendliness; Explanatory Variables; Mobility Management; Psychological Factors; Psychological Methods; Public Transportation; Travel Modes; Urban Transportation; Altruism; Car Use; Commuting; Developing World; Logit Analysis; Psychology; Public Transport; Transportation Safety; Transportation System; Travel Behavior; China; Indonesia; Japan; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","Developing countries; Logistic regression; Commuting modes; Environmental friendliness; Explanatory variables; Mobility management; Psychological factors; Psychological methods; Public transportation; Travel modes; Urban transportation; altruism; car use; commuting; developing world; logit analysis; psychology; public transport; transportation safety; transportation system; travel behavior; China; Indonesia; Japan; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","","","The survey in this study was supported by the research group for the “Applicability of Ecological Transportation Systems in Developing Countries” of the International Association of Traffic and Safety Science.

Among them, the most significant research questions relate to data confidentiality and user privacy. Encryption was regarded as a solution for data confidentiality. The privacy of a user is characterized by the query he poses to the server and its result. We explore the techniques to execute the SQL query over the encrypted data without revealing to the server any information about the query such as the query type or the query pattern, and its result. By implementing all the relational operators by using the unique selection operator on the server-side database with a constant number of elements in each time of selection, our proposal can defeat against the statistical attacks of the untrusted server compromising data confidentiality and user privacy.

Survey data were collected from 238 plants in three industries across eight countries and structural equation modeling was used to test this framework. The results indicate a dominant role of the internal QM in SCQM which has a positive impact on the other SCQM dimensions and two types of quality performance. Downstream QM is found to mediate the relationship between internal QM and customer satisfaction, while there is a lack of direct impact of upstream QM on either type of quality performance. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Empirical Study; Quality Management; Quality Performance; Supply Chain","","","","Acknowledgments The authors appreciate the financial support for this research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research, No. 22330112.","Adam, Everett E., An international study of quality improvement approach and firm performance, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 17, 9, pp. 842-873, (1997); Ahire, Sanjay L., Impact of design management and process management on quality: An empirical investigation, Journal of Operations Management, 18, 5, pp. 549-575, (2000); International Journal of Quality Science, (1998); Ahire, Sanjay L., Development and validation of TQM implementation constructs, Decision Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 23-56, (1996); Anderson, John C., A Path Analytic Model of a Theory of Quality Management Underlying the Deming Management Method: Preliminary Empirical Findings, Decision Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 637-658, (1995); Arauz, Rita, Measuring changes in quality management: An empirical analysis of Japanese manufacturing companies, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 20, 12, pp. 1337-1374, (2009); Bentler, Peter M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models, Psychological Bulletin, 107, 2, pp. 238-246, (1990); Testing Structural Equation Models, (1993); Carter, Joseph R., The Impact of Interorganizational Alliances in Improving Supplier Quality, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 24, 5, pp. 15-23, (1994); Choi, Thomas Y., The TQM Paradox: Relations among TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction, Journal of Operations Management, 17, 1, pp. 59-75, (1998)","","","","","","","","19369743; 19369735","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878793700"

There is an unknown parameter θ within the coefficients of (X, Y). The aim of this paper is to estimate θ from a regularly spaced sample of the process (X, Y). When the dynamic of X is known, an estimator is constructed by using a moment-based method. We show that our estimators will work if the Blumenthal-Getoor index of the jump part of Y is less than 2. What is perhaps the most interesting is the rate at which the estimators converge: it is 1/√n (as when the underlying processes are not contaminated by jumps) when that index is not greater than 1. When the dynamic of X is unknown, we introduce a spot volatility estimator-based approach to estimate θ. This approach can work even if the sample is contaminated by microstructure noise. © 2010, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

All data were collected from medical files in Japan, and from medical files and self-administered questionnaires in Vietnam. The proportion of mothers without secure feeling of confidence in the present study was 22% in Japan and 66% in Vietnam. Significant factors associated with a lack of confidence were first-time motherhood and unintended pregnancy in the Japanese dataset and younger age in the Vietnamese dataset. In both groups, a higher proportion of mothers who lacked confidence reported negative parenting outcomes than did confident mothers. Among the three psychological measurements (mood, self-efficacy and depression), higher self-efficacy was associated independently with a significantly reduced risk of not having confidence in child rearing. These results suggest the importance of developing parenting support programs to help Japanese and Vietnamese mothers, particularly those who are young, first-time mothers or who became pregnant unexpectedly, improve their self-efficacy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child Rearing; Japan; Maternal Confidence; Self-efficacy; Vietnam","","","","Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Dr. Pham Viet Thanh, Director of Tu Du Obstetrical and Gynecological Hospital for providing permission to conduct this study.

We propose a new heuristic method exploiting the equality constraints in a given POP, and strengthen the SDP relaxation so as to achieve faster convergence to the global optimum of the POP. We can apply this method to both of the dense SDP relaxation which was originally proposed by Lasserre, and the sparse SDP relaxation which was later proposed by Kim, Kojima, Muramatsu and Waki. Especially, our heuristic method incorporated into the sparse SDP relaxation method has shown a promising performance in numerical experiments on large scale sparse POPs. Roughly speaking, we induce valid equality constraints from the original equality constraints of the POP, and then use them to convert the dense or sparse SDP relaxation into a new stronger SDP relaxation. Our method is enlightened by some strong theoretical results on the convergence of SDP relaxations for POPs with equality constraints provided by Lasserre, Parrilo, and Laurent, but we place the main emphasis on the practical aspect to compute more accurate lower bounds of larger sparse POPs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Equality Constraints; Exploiting Sparsity; Global Optimization; Nonlinear Programming; Optimization; Polynomial Optimization; Semidefinite Programming","","","","","undefined, (2008); Henrion, Didier, GloptiPoly: Global Optimization over Polynomials with Matlab and SeDuMi, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 29, 2, pp. 165-194, (2003); Kim, Sunyoung, Generalized lagrangian duals and sums of squares relaxations of sparse polynomial optimization blems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 15, 3, pp. 697-719, (2005); Lasserre, Jean Bernard, An explicit exact SDP relaxation for nonlinear 0-1 programs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2081, pp. 293-303, (2001); Lasserre, Jean Bernard, Global optimization with polynomials and the problem of moments, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 11, 3, pp. 796-817, (2000); Lasserre, Jean Bernard, Polynomials nonnegative on a grid and discrete optimization, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 354, 2, pp. 631-649, (2002); Lasserre, Jean Bernard, Convergent SDP-relaxations in polynomial optimization with sparsity, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 17, 3, pp. 822-843, (2006); Mathematical Programming, (2004); undefined, (2000); An Explicit Construction of Distinguished Representations of Polynomials Nonnegative Over Finite Sets, (2002)","","Operations Research Society of Japan","","","","","","04534514","","JORJA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-44649190445"
