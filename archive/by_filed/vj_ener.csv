Eddy current (EC) testing is widely used due to its non-contact nature and high sensitivity to surface and sub-surface cracks. This study reports a flexible eddy current array (FECA) sensor with six bendable channels designed to detect surface and sub-surface cracks in the weld zones of steel structures. The excitation coils are connected in series to enhance signal intensity, while interleaved detection coils minimize lift-off effects and improve sensitivity. A real-time measurement system was developed by integrating the FECA sensor with a LabVIEW-based digital lock-in amplifier. Experiments using 500 kHz and 5 kHz excitation frequencies demonstrated effective detection of surface and sub-surface cracks, respectively, including under zinc coatings. Despite manual scanning, stable and repeatable signals were recorded across multiple channels. The proposed system offers high sensitivity, real-time capability, and adaptability to complex geometries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. 22H01724 and supported by Fire and Disaster Management Agency Promotion Program for Scientific Fire and Disaster Prevention Technologies Program Grant Number JPJ000255.","Gupta, Mridul, Advances in applications of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT): A review, Advances in Materials and Processing Technologies, 8, 2, pp. 2286-2307, (2022); Katunin, Andrzej, Damage identification in aircraft composite structures: A case study using various non-destructive testing techniques, Composite Structures, 127, pp. 1-9, (2015); Arâmburu, Arthur Behenck, Non-destructive testing techniques for pressure vessels manufactured with polymer composite materials: A systematic review, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 246, (2025); Bensaber, Ahmed, The assessment of concrete subjected to compressive and flexural preloading using nondestructive testing methods, correlation between concrete strength and combined method (SonReb), Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 222, (2023); Fu, Lanling, Artificial neural network-based damage detection of composite material using laser ultrasonic technology, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 220, (2023); Xu, Pengju, Rail crack detection and evaluation at high speed based on differential ECT system, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 166, (2020); Xu, Pengju, Study on high-speed rail defect detection methods based on ECT, MFL testing and ACFM, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 206, (2023); Trung, Le Quang, Crack detection in low carbon steel using Rotating Uniform Eddy Current probe and noise signal filtering based on Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis, Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, 362, (2023); Wang, Xiujing, Response Analysis of MEMS Magnetic Field Sensor Based on Eddy Current Effect, pp. 377-381, (2023); Trung, Le Quang, Crack detection using a cutting-edge flexible eddy current sensor with voltage and phase measurement techniques, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 219, (2024)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","27313395","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011719907"

Two MFCs types were constructed: one with magnetite pre-inoculated anodes (MFCM) and another with sludge-only inoculated anodes (MFCS). Both MFCs were operated with either starch or ethanol as the cosubstrate, and in both cases, MFCM consistently outperformed MFCS. For instance, with starch, MFCM achieved 99 % decolorization and a peak voltage of 380.74 mV within 30 hours, compared to 89 % and negligible, unstable voltage in MFCS. A 1500 Ω resistance was optimal for decolorization and electricity generation in MFCM. Microbial analysis revealed that magnetite pre-inoculation enriched electroactive genera, enhanced diversity and extracellular electron transfer, and stabilized microbial networks across cosubstrates. These findings highlight the potential of magnetite pre-inoculated anodes as a novel practical strategy for early anode biofilm control, with significant implications for scalable MFCs applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Azo Dye; Ethanol; Magnetite Pre-inoculation; Microbial Community Analysis; Microbial Fuel Cells; Starch; Alcohol; Magnetite; Starch; Coloring Agents; Ethanol; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Starch; Wastewater; Anodes; Bioelectric Phenomena; Electron Transitions; Electrophysiology; Gas Fuel Purification; Wastewater Treatment; Azo-dyes; Cell Types; Cosubstrates; Decolourization; Dyeing Wastewater; Dyes Treatment; Magnetite Pre-inoculation; Microbial Community Analysis; Microbials; Reactive Black 5; Ethanol; Microbial Fuel Cells; Starch; Alcohol; Azo Dye; Fuel; Magnetite; Starch; Coloring Agent; Biofilm; Dye; Electricity Generation; Electrode; Fuel Cell; Inoculation; Microbial Community; Wastewater Treatment; Article; Bioenergy; Controlled Study; Decolorization; Electric Potential; Electricity; Electron Transport; Microbial Fuel Cell; Nonhuman; Sewage Treatment; Sludge; Wastewater; Chemistry; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Procedures; Water Management; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biofilms; Coloring Agents; Electricity; Electrodes; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Wastewater; Water Purification","Anodes; Bioelectric phenomena; Electron transitions; Electrophysiology; Gas fuel purification; Wastewater treatment; Azo-dyes; Cell types; Cosubstrates; Decolourization; Dyeing wastewater; Dyes treatment; Magnetite pre-inoculation; Microbial community analysis; Microbials; Reactive black 5; Ethanol; Microbial fuel cells; Starch; alcohol; azo dye; fuel; magnetite; starch; coloring agent; biofilm; dye; electricity generation; electrode; fuel cell; inoculation; microbial community; wastewater treatment; Article; bioenergy; controlled study; decolorization; electric potential; electricity; electron transport; microbial fuel cell; nonhuman; sewage treatment; sludge; wastewater; chemistry; isolation and purification; microbiology; procedures; water management; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biofilms; Coloring Agents; Electricity; Electrodes; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Wastewater; Water Purification","","alcohol, 64-17-5; magnetite, 1309-38-2, 1317-61-9; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Coloring Agents; Ethanol; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Starch; Wastewater","The authors thank Mr. Hirotoshi Netsu for his technical support and Nagaoka Chou Joka Center for providing anaerobic sludge.

Sharply increasing salinity to 5.0 and 15.0 g NaCl/L caused adverse effects on the performance, resulting in loss of active biomass and reduction in organic removal and nitrification capacity. Specifically, the abundance of Proteobacteria declined from 81.5 % at 2.5 g NaCl/L to 56.1 % at 5.0 g NaCl/L and 43.5 % at 15.0 g NaCl/L. Higher salinities (10 – 15 g NaCl/L) promoted irreversible fouling (R<inf>f</inf> was 33.5–40.6 %) due to the increased secretion of soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which adsorbed onto the membrane pores. The presence of Chlorofexi could promote the formation of larger flocs and a decrease in irreversible fouling. Ultimately, the optimal condition for an anoxic MBR treating saline wastewater could be up to 15.0 g NaCl/L, suitable for various industrial applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Microbial Community; Nitrification; Physical Cleaning; Trans-membrane Pressure Recovery; Treatment Performance; Sodium Chloride; Membranes, Artificial; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Biological Water Treatment; Membrane Fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Sodium Chloride; Surface Treatment; Wastewater Treatment; Irreversible Fouling; Long-term Effects; Microbial Communities; Microbial Membranes; Physical Cleanings; Pollutants Removal; Pressure Recovery; Trans-membrane Pressure Recovery; Transmembrane Pressures; Treatment Performance; Bioreactors; Nitrification; Sodium Chloride; Anoxic Conditions; Biomass; Bioreactor; Fouling; Microbial Community; Nitrification; Pollutant Removal; Salinity; Wastewater Treatment; Adsorption; Article; Chloroflexi; Controlled Study; Fouling Control; Nonhuman; Particle Size; Pollutant; Polymerization; Pressure; Proteobacteria; Wastewater; Water Quality; Anaerobic Growth; Artificial Membrane; Biofouling; Chemistry; Devices; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Procedures; Water Management; Water Pollutant; Anaerobiosis; Biofouling; Biomass; Membranes, Artificial; Salinity; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification","Biological water treatment; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Sodium chloride; Surface treatment; Wastewater treatment; Irreversible fouling; Long-term effects; Microbial communities; Microbial membranes; Physical cleanings; Pollutants removal; Pressure recovery; Trans-membrane pressure recovery; Transmembrane pressures; Treatment performance; Bioreactors; Nitrification; sodium chloride; anoxic conditions; biomass; bioreactor; fouling; microbial community; nitrification; pollutant removal; salinity; wastewater treatment; adsorption; Article; Chloroflexi; controlled study; fouling control; nonhuman; particle size; pollutant; polymerization; pressure; Proteobacteria; wastewater; water quality; anaerobic growth; artificial membrane; biofouling; chemistry; devices; isolation and purification; microbiology; procedures; water management; water pollutant; Anaerobiosis; Biofouling; Biomass; Membranes, Artificial; Salinity; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification","","sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1; Membranes, Artificial; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2025-20-16.

However, their practical deployment remains limited due to the lack of compact, flexible, and sustainable energy sources. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs), which convert body heat into electricity, present a promising solution but are typically hindered by small temperature gradients and the requirement of bulky heat sinks that compromise flexibility. To address these challenges, we developed an ultra-thin flexible thermoelectric generator (FTEG) integrated with a radiative cooling (RC) layer that passively enhances heat dissipation under natural convection. The device, fabricated using high-performance thermoelectric materials on a soft silicone substrate, maintained a total thickness of just 2.26 mm. Finite element modeling and experimental validation confirmed that the RC layer effectively increased the temperature gradient across thermoelectric legs, significantly improving the output power compared to conventional graphite-based or no-cooling designs. The FTEG achieved a maximum normalized power density of 3.51 μW/cm2 under temperature conditions representative of wearable use (T<inf>skin</inf> of 32 °C and T<inf>ambient</inf> of 26 °C). The harvested energy was then stored using a power management circuit and capacitor. This stored energy was successfully used to power a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensing module, enabling stable wireless transmission driven entirely by body heat. These results highlight the practical potential of integrating passive radiative cooling into flexible thermoelectric systems, paving the way for high-performance, battery-free wearable electronics and autonomous IoT applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexible Thermoelectric Generator; Harvesting Body Waste Heat; Radiative Cooling; Self-power; Wearable Applications; Cooling Systems; Electronic Cooling; Flexible Electronics; Low Power Electronics; Silicones; Thermal Gradients; Thermal Management (electronics); Thermoelectric Equipment; Thermoelectricity; Wearable Sensors; Body Heats; Flexible Thermoelectric Generator; Harvesting Body Waste Heat; Lower Energies; Power; Radiative Cooling; Self-power; Self-powered; Thermoelectric Generators; Wearable Applications; Radiative Cooling","Cooling systems; Electronic cooling; Flexible electronics; Low power electronics; Silicones; Thermal gradients; Thermal management (electronics); Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Wearable sensors; Body heats; Flexible thermoelectric generator; Harvesting body waste heat; Lower energies; Power; Radiative cooling; Self-power; Self-powered; Thermoelectric generators; Wearable applications; Radiative Cooling","","","Part of this work was carried out at the Electronic and Optoelectronic Device Research Unit, School of Science, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Thailand, and the Micro/Nanomachining Research and Education Center (MNC), Tohoku University , Japan.

The benchmark aims to facilitate code-to-code comparisons in neutronics calculations for light-water cooled small modular reactors (LW-SMRs), driven by growing global interest in their deployment due to advanced technology, licensing progress, and commercial viability. This highlights the need for high-fidelity analyses to assess the design, safety, and operational features of these reactors. This study focuses on performing neutronics benchmarking calculations of the proposed NuScale-like core using SCALE/KENO-VI, evaluating k-eff, control rod worths, and power distributions with ENDF/B-VII.1 continuous energy (CE) and 252-group libraries. The impact of ENDF/B-VII.0, VII.1, and VIII.0 libraries on neutronics results was also assessed using Serpent 2 (v2.1.31). Results show that SCALE/KENO-VI with ENDF/B-VII.1 CE and 252-group libraries aligns well with the reference, with discrepancies within 44 pcm for reactivity prediction and generally less than 2 % for power distribution, except for the all-rods-in scenario using the 252-group library, which shows a reactivity deviation of 139 pcm. In addition, Serpent 2 with ENDF/B-VIII.0 produced notable differences in the k-eff values compared to ENDF/B-VII.0 and VII.1. Consequently, this work provides valuable and significant neutronics reference data for the proposed NuScale-like core model. Moreover, the NuScale-like core model developed here using SCALE/KENO-VI can serve as a basis for future neutronics and core performance analyses for NuScale-like reactors and other similar LW-SMR designs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Endf/b-vii.1; Endf/b-viii.0; Nuscale; Scale/keno-vi; Serpent; Smr","","","","This research is funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam under grant number \u0110TCB.14/22/VKHKTHN .

The first aim is to design a two-level integrated control (TLIC) for frequency support at the level of grid-side VSCs (GSVSC). The first level of TLIC is based on adaptive inertial controller (AIC) and adaptive droop controller (ADC). At this level, by adjusting the coefficients of the AIC and ADC controllers, all wind units (WU) that are in their maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode will work to compensate for the secondary frequency fall (SFF). To achieve this aim, first, WUs are divided into different clusters based on their rotor speed, so that they can be operated sequentially to support the frequency. In the second level, TLIC has been used to establish a fair power flow between GSVSC stations by measuring local frequencies in the onshore power system (OPS), which is called Communication Free Allocation (CFA). In addition to supporting the OPS frequency, this design is able to compensate for the SFF deviation when the WUs are in their MPPT operation. The second aim of this paper is to design a H<inf>∞</inf> resistant controller based on loop shaping at the WSVSC station level. The proposed H<inf>∞</inf> method relies on the mutual characteristic decomposition method (MCDM) for voltage control. DC of MTDC network is designed in such a way that the plant model based on Master-Slave (MS) can reduce MTDC voltage fluctuations under internal and external disturbances. Response the simulation results are evaluated and analyzed in the form of different scenarios that have been done in the MATLAB software environment. Examining these results shows that the proposed plan for damping fluctuations caused by various uncertainties in the power system is very robust. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Controller; Dc Voltage; Frequency Deviation; H∞ Controller; Multi-terminal Direct Current; Power System Stability; Wind Units; Adaptive Control Systems; Control System Stability; Electric Power System Control; Electric Power System Stability; Matlab; Offshore Oil Well Production; Robust Control; Voltage Control; Wind Power; Adaptive Controllers; Dc Voltage; Droop Controllers; Frequency Deviation; H ∞ Controllers; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Multi-terminal Direct Currents; Power; Power Systems Stability; Wind Unit; Controllers","Adaptive control systems; Control system stability; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; MATLAB; Offshore oil well production; Robust control; Voltage control; Wind power; Adaptive controllers; DC voltage; Droop controllers; Frequency deviation; H ∞ controllers; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Multi-terminal direct currents; Power; Power systems stability; Wind unit; Controllers","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP23K03821 .

This paper introduces an innovative management strategy for Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to ensure reliable voltage regulation in distributed power systems with substantial Photovoltaic (PV) integration. The proposed method integrates grid sensitivity factor with Second-Order Cone Programming (SCOP) modeling for power flow. BESS's optimal size and location are determined by minimizing the total cost of operation, voltage deviations, power losses, and peak demands in the distribution network. Additionally, the study explores the impact of Demand Response (DR) on BESS size and placement. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated using a modified IEEE 33-bus system with actual load and PV generation data. By incorporating BESS's optimal charging and discharging into traditional power flow analysis, grid parameters such as voltage and power flow accuracy are validated. Simulation results show the optimization model's effectiveness, emphasizing the benefits of properly coordinating BESS in distribution systems with integrated PV. The numerical results indicate that the integration of BESS allocation with DR demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves a substantial reduction in energy losses (19 %), highlighting the effectiveness of the method in ensuring grid reliability under high PV penetration scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bess Optimization; Demand Response; Distribution Network; Second-order Cone Programming (socp); Sensitivity Analysis; Distributed Wind; Second-order Cone Programming; Sensitivity Analysis; Solar Fuels; Battery Energy Storage System Optimization; Battery Energy Storage Systems; Demand Response; Demand Response Programs; Photovoltaics; Power Flows; Sensitivity Analyzes; System Optimizations; Battery Storage","Distributed Wind; Second-order cone programming; Sensitivity analysis; Solar fuels; Battery energy storage system optimization; Battery energy storage systems; Demand response; Demand response programs; Photovoltaics; Power flows; Sensitivity analyzes; System optimizations; Battery storage","","","","Chamier-Gliszczyński, Norbert, The Influence of Distributed Generation on the Operation of the Power System, Based on the Example of PV Micro-Installations, Energies, 16, 3, (2023); Nour, Ahmed M.M., Review on voltage-violation mitigation techniques of distribution networks with distributed rooftop PV systems, IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution, 14, 3, pp. 349-361, (2020); Marra, Francesco, A decentralized storage strategy for residential feeders with photovoltaics, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 5, 2, pp. 974-981, (2014); Yang, Ye, Sizing strategy of distributed battery storage system with high penetration of photovoltaic for voltage regulation and peak load shaving, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 5, 2, pp. 982-991, (2014); Aichhorn, Andreas, A cost effective battery sizing strategy based on a detailed battery lifetime model and an economic energy management strategy, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, (2012); Ru, Yu, Storage size determination for grid-connected photovoltaic systems, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 4, 1, pp. 68-81, (2013); Xu, Lin, An improved optimal sizing method for wind-solar-battery hybrid power system, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 4, 3, pp. 774-785, (2013); Brekken, Ted K.A., Optimal energy storage sizing and control for wind power applications, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 2, 1, pp. 69-77, (2011); Ravindra, Harsha, Dynamic interactions between distribution network voltage regulators for large and distributed PV plants, Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference, (2012); Zhang, Weiwei, Optimal Allocation of BESS in Distribution Network Based on Improved Equilibrium Optimizer, Frontiers in Energy Research, 10, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524677","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005396790"

In recent years, many resilience measurements have been developed to assess transport network performance under disruptions. However, few of these assessments precisely capture the variations of individuals’ daily activity-travel patterns that arise in response to TN disruptions. Considering the spatio-temporal correlation between activity behaviour and travel behaviour, this paper presents an activity-based space-time accessibility measure for assessing the resilience of TN. This method integrates individuals’ activity and travel choice behaviours, TN, and activity locations into a unified framework. Multiple scenarios are designed concerning various disruption occurrence times, disruption levels, recovery times, activity location plans, service times at activity location, and transit vehicle headways to comprehensively capture the factors influencing TN resilience. The effectiveness of the proposed measure is demonstrated by a case study in Xi'an City, China. The results indicate that the proposed activity-based approach is capable of reflecting the dynamic performance of TN by considering the attraction of activity locations as well as network topology and passenger flow. The measure enables policymakers to accurately quantify resilience and develop contingency plans by considering how individuals’ activity-travel patterns change following disruptions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activity And Travel Choice Behaviours; Activity-based Approach; Network Resilience; Space-time Accessibility; Computer System Recovery; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Location Based Services; Mass Transportation; Motor Transportation; Traffic Control; Transportation Routes; Urban Growth; Urban Transportation; Activity And Travel Choice Behavior; Activity Locations; Activity-based; Activity-based Approach; Network Resilience; Space-time Accessibility; Sustainable Urban Development; Transit Networks; Travel Choice Behaviours; Urban Areas; Location; Accessibility; Public Transport; Sustainable Development; Travel Behavior; Urban Development; China; Shaanxi; Xian","Computer system recovery; Economic and social effects; Economics; Location based services; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Activity and travel choice behavior; Activity locations; Activity-based; Activity-based approach; Network resilience; Space-time accessibility; Sustainable urban development; Transit networks; Travel choice behaviours; Urban areas; Location; accessibility; public transport; sustainable development; travel behavior; urban development; China; Shaanxi; Xian","","","The research work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 42471498 , 42261144745 ).","Ashiru, Olu, Utility of schedules: Theoretical model of departure-time choice and activity-time allocation with application to individual activity schedules, Transportation Research Record, 1894, pp. 84-98, (2004); Baroud, Hiba, Importance measures for inland waterway network resilience, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 62, pp. 55-67, (2014); Ben-Akiva, Moshe E., Integration of an activity-based model system and a residential location model, Urban Studies, 35, 7, pp. 1131-1153, (1998); Berdica, Katja, An introduction to road vulnerability: What has been done, is done and should be done, Transport Policy, 9, 2, pp. 117-127, (2002); Bergantino, Angela Stefania, Assessing transport network resilience: empirical insights from real-world data studies, Transport Reviews, 44, 4, pp. 834-857, (2024); Boura, Georgia, Incorporating geographic interdependencies into the resilience assessment of multimodal public transport networks, Journal of Transport Geography, 118, (2024); Bruneau, Michel, A Framework to Quantitatively Assess and Enhance the Seismic Resilience of Communities, Earthquake Spectra, 19, 4, pp. 733-752, (2003); Cantelmo, Guido, A utility-based dynamic demand estimation model that explicitly accounts for activity scheduling and duration, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 114, pp. 303-320, (2018); Chan, Raymond, Measuring Transportation System Resilience: Response of Rail Transit to Weather Disruptions, Natural Hazards Review, 17, 1, (2016); Chen, Yuan, Assessing accessibility-based service effectiveness (ABSEV) and social equity for urban bus transit: A sustainability perspective, Sustainable Cities and Society, 44, pp. 499-510, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22106707","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011874733"

In this study, we use first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory to explore the effect of strain on the TE performance of 2D vdW heterobilayer MoTe<inf>2</inf>/PtS<inf>2</inf>. A strong Rashba spin-splitting is observed in the valence band, resulting in an increase in the Seebeck coefficient for the p-type. The lattice thermal conductivity of MoTe<inf>2</inf>/PtS<inf>2</inf> is remarkably low, about 0.6 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K, due to large anharmonic scattering. Furthermore, biaxial strain enhances the power factor (PF) by introducing band convergence. At a strain of 2%, the optimal PF for the n-type material reaches 170 μW/cmK2, indicating an approximately 84.78% increase compared to the unstrained state (92 μW/cmK2).

The results demonstrated that rice husk biochar exhibited excellent adsorption performance, with total organic carbon adsorption efficiency ranging from 60 to 80%, depending on the type of wastewater. Also, 50% of total nitrogen, 70% of phosphorus, and about 80% of potassium were adsorbed onto the biochar. Desorption from human urine–adsorbed biochar produced a solution with 236.5 mg/L N, 256.73 mg/L P, and 4.6 mg/L K, which was then used to grow O. basilicum L. in comparison with the Hoagland solution. The growth indexes of the plants were slightly lower but comparable in statistical perspectives. Nevertheless, the nutritional profile was better and the economic efficiency was superior, thanks to the low costs in nutrient preparation.

This paper aims to conduct a rational statistical approach to evaluate the current situation of surface water quality in the Mekong Delta, applying Factor Analysis (FA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) to a database of 3117 samples collected by national and provincial monitoring stations. The results revealed significant contamination with organic pollutants (BOD5: 3.50–172.870 mg/L, COD: 6.493–472.984 mg/L), pesticides (e.g., DDTs: n.d to 1.227 mg/L), trace metals (As: 0.006–0.046 mg/L, Cr: n.d–1.960 mg/L), and microbial indicators (Coliforms: n.d–45,100 MPN/100 mL), often higher than the WHO drinking water threshold. PCA/AHC analysis identified the following five major pollution components: (1) organic pollution and sewage/industrial and deposited chemicals (PCA1—23.08% variance); (2) pesticide and agricultural runoff derived contamination with Hg (PCA2—15.44%); (3) microbial pollution of the water was found to correlate positively with Zn and Cu content (PCA3—8.90%); (4) salinity was found to mobilize As and Cr (PCA4—8.00%); (5) nutrient/microbial pollution presumably from agricultural and sewage inputs (PCA5—7.22%). AHC showed some spatial variability that grouped samples in urban/industrial (Cluster 1), rural/agricultural (Cluster 2), and a highly contaminated one, where water was toxic and presented with microbial and Cd contamination (Cluster 3). Levels of pesticides, Cr, and microbial pollution were higher than reported in previous Mekong Delta studies and exceeded regional trends. These results emphasize the importance of holistic water management strategies, including better wastewater treatment, pesticide control, sustainable farming, and climate-adaptive measures to reduce saltwater intrusion and safeguard drinking water quality for the Mekong Delta. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering; Factor Analysis; Mekong Delta; Principal Component Analysis; Water Quality; Agricultural Runoff; Drinking Water; Pesticide; Salinity; Surface Water; Water Management; Water Quality; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","agricultural runoff; drinking water; pesticide; salinity; surface water; water management; water quality; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Vietnam, through two projects: \u201CStudy on the Mechanism of Transport, Accumulation, and Dispersion of Pollutants in Coastal Waters from Vung Tau to Kien Giang\u201D (Project Code: \u0110T\u0110L.CN-57/21), and \u201CStudy on the Development of Characteristic Lines of Meteoric, Surface, and Groundwater to Determine the Contribution Ratio of Upstream Water Sources to the Mekong Delta\u201D (Project Code: \u0110T\u0110L.CN-54/22).

Yet, this heritage is rapidly declining: from over 240 structures in 2000, fewer than 100 remain today. This study introduces a heritage-based evaluation framework to assess and preserve French colonial buildings using Le Loi Street, Hue’s historic “Western quarter” as a pilot site. Fourteen colonial-era buildings were systematically assessed through field surveys and expert consultation. A total of 40 specialists participated in the criteria development process, and eight selected experts conducted detailed building evaluations. The final framework includes three main categories and nine specific criteria, based on a 100-point scale, incorporating architectural integrity, historical and cultural significance, contextual fit, and adaptive reuse potential.

RESULTS: The synthesis of an iron oxides/zeolite X composite (IOZX) was investigated at room temperature with an iron salt to zeolite X ratio of 10 wt%, an ion exchange time of 5 h and 15% NaOH. With a surface area of 312 m2 g−1, the obtained IOZX also comprised SiO<inf>2</inf> (40.96%), Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (32.08%), Na<inf>2</inf>O (24.07%) and Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (2.72%). Besides, the uniform distribution of iron oxide particles in the composite was determined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. IOZX exhibited excellent CV removal performance at concentrations ranging from 200 to 500 mg L−1. After 30 min, 96.87% of CV was removed at the optimal conditions such as pH 7, a catalyst dose of 0.5 g L−1, 10 mmol L−1 H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentration and a 300 mg L−1 CV concentration. The degradation followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, with R2 close to 0.99. The catalytic activities were effectively retained after 10 reaction cycles, indicating the robust performance of IOZX. CONCLUSION: The key success of the current work was the formation of an IOZX catalyst derived from affordable and commonly available byproducts, leading to cost reductions and supporting sustainable practices. The synthesized catalyst could be further advanced and potentially applied for the remediation of cationic dye from aqueous solution. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline Agents; Crystal Violet; Heterogeneous Fenton-like; Iron Oxides/zeolite X Composite; Rice Husk Ash; Aluminum Oxide; Crystal Violet; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron Oxide; Silicon Dioxide; Sodium Hydroxide; Alkalinity; Bioremediation; Catalyst Activity; Catalyst Supports; Catalytic Oxidation; Chemical Industry; Concrete Construction; Cost Reduction; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Salt Removal; Alkaline Agent; Alkalines; Crystal Violet; Fenton Likes; Heterogeneous Fenton; Heterogeneous Fenton-like; Iron Oxide/zeolite X Composite; Rice-husk Ash; Zeolite X; ]+ Catalyst; Sodium Hydroxide; Aluminum Oxide; Crystal Violet; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron Oxide; Iron Salt; Silicon Dioxide; Sodium Hydroxide; Zeolite; Adsorption; Article; Ash; Catalysis; Catalyst; Chemical Composition; Chemical Reaction Kinetics; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Degradation; Fenton Reaction; Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Ion Exchange; Kinetics; Mass; Ph; Physical Chemistry; Pore Size; Pore Volume; Rice Husk; Room Temperature; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Surface Area; Synthesis; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction","Alkalinity; Bioremediation; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical industry; Concrete construction; Cost reduction; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Salt removal; Alkaline agent; Alkalines; Crystal violet; Fenton likes; Heterogeneous fenton; Heterogeneous fenton-like; Iron oxide/zeolite X composite; Rice-husk ash; Zeolite X; ]+ catalyst; Sodium hydroxide; aluminum oxide; crystal violet; hydrogen peroxide; iron oxide; iron salt; silicon dioxide; sodium hydroxide; zeolite; adsorption; Article; ash; catalysis; catalyst; chemical composition; chemical reaction kinetics; comparative study; controlled study; degradation; Fenton reaction; field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; ion exchange; kinetics; mass; pH; physical chemistry; pore size; pore volume; rice husk; room temperature; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction","","aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; crystal violet, 467-63-0, 548-62-9; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; iron oxide, 1332-37-2; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2","","Valizadeh, Kamran, Magnetized inulin by Fe3O4 as a bio-nano adsorbent for treating water contaminated with methyl orange and crystal violet dyes, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Shinde, Rohit Shankar, Study of Fe3O4 and Cu2+ doped modified Fe3O4 nano catalyst for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and eriochrome black-T dyes: Synthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial assessment, Inorganic Chemistry Communications, 170, (2024); Yan, Tong, A highly efficient Co-based catalyst for peroxymonosulfate activation for rapid degradation of RhB over a wide pH range, Inorganic Chemistry Communications, 170, (2024); Sun, Pengfei, Efficient removal of crystal violet using Fe3O4-coated biochar: The role of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and modeling study their adsorption behavior, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Chen, Chiingchang, Degradation of crystal violet by an FeGAC/H 2O 2 process, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 196, pp. 420-425, (2011); Liang, Huan, Diatomite coated with Fe2O3 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for degradation of organic pollutant, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers, 49, pp. 105-112, (2015); Ghasemi, Homa, Decolorization of wastewater by heterogeneous Fenton reaction using MnO2-Fe3O4/CuO hybrid catalysts, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 9, 2, (2021); Vu, Anh Tuan, Preparation of mesoporous Fe2O3·SiO2 composite from rice husk as an efficient heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst for degradation of organic dyes, Journal of Water Process Engineering, 28, pp. 169-180, (2019); Le, Van Thuan, Efficient photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet under natural sunlight using Fe3O4/ZnO nanoparticles embedded carboxylate-rich carbon, Materials Letters, 283, (2021); Abdelrahman, Ehab A., Facile synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticles from Egyptian insecticide cans for efficient photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and crystal violet dyes, Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy, 222, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10974660; 02682575","","JCTBD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001816194"

Moreover, existing linear economy has also worsened status of plastic pollution. Thus, controlling plastic pollution and transitioning from linear economy to circular economy are becoming urgent. Municipal solid waste management plays a fundamental role in plastic pollution control and transition to circular economy. This study aimed at understanding status of plastic leakage and clarifying reversed logistic system in Danang city, Vietnam. The waste flow diagram (WFD) and material flow analysis (MFA) based on principle of mass balance were applied in this study. Yearly unmanaged plastic waste was estimated at 2198 tonnes. The amount of plastic waste leaked into aquatic environment was estimated at 0.99 kg/cap/year. Majority of unmanaged plastic waste mainly originated from uncollected waste (78.05% of total unmanaged plastic waste) and collection service (21.36% of total unmanaged plastic waste). Regarding informal reversed logistic system, itinerant buyers and waste pickers considerably contributed to recyclable waste recovery, collecting with about 69.34 tonnes (79.32% of total recovered recyclable waste) of recyclable material on a daily basis. Despite potential for circulation, other types of recyclable waste — glass, textile and leather, wood, as well as rubber — have not been widely collected for recovery. Results of this study offer scientific base for managers, policymakers, decision makers and related stakeholders of solid waste management system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular Economy; Informal Sector; Material Flow Analysis (mfa); Vietnam; Waste Flow Diagram (wfd); Bioremediation; Energy Conservation; Land Fill; Plastic Recycling; Wood Wastes; Circular Economy; Informal Sector; Material Flow Analyze; Materials Flow Analysis; Plastic Pollutions; Plastics Waste; Recyclable Wastes; Viet Nam; Waste Flow Diagram; Waste Flow Diagrams; Municipal Solid Waste","Bioremediation; Energy conservation; Land fill; Plastic recycling; Wood wastes; Circular economy; Informal sector; Material flow analyze; Materials flow analysis; Plastic pollutions; Plastics waste; Recyclable wastes; Viet Nam; Waste flow diagram; Waste flow diagrams; Municipal solid waste","","","The authors would like to be grateful to Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) for offering scholarship to first author.

The WO<inf>3</inf> film (denoted as WO<inf>3</inf>(w-Oxa)) prepared with Oxa was composed of relatively large layered-sheets with 2-5 μm length with predominant growth of the (202) plane (parallel to the substrate), in contrast to small layered-sheets with 1-2 μm length with predominant growth of the (020) or (200) planes for the WO<inf>3</inf>(w/o-Oxa) film prepared without Oxa. Although the photocurrents were generated above 0.6 V vs. RHE for WO<inf>3</inf>(w-Oxa) and WO<inf>3</inf>(w/o-Oxa) electrodes, the incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE<inf>420</inf> = 38%) at 420 nm and 1.23 V vs. RHE for the former was 2.7 times higher than that (14%) of the latter. The higher IPCE<inf>420</inf> for WO<inf>3</inf>(w-Oxa) is ascribed to higher charge separation (η<inf>sep</inf> = 50%) and catalytic (η<inf>cat</inf> = 95%) efficiencies compared to those (η<inf>sep</inf> = 19% and η<inf>cat</inf> = 82%) for the WO<inf>3</inf>(w/o-Oxa) electrode. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) measurement suggested effective bulk charge transport in the WO<inf>3</inf>(w-Oxa) electrode compared to the WO<inf>3</inf>(w/o-Oxa) electrode, with advantages suppression of charge recombination, being responsible for the higher η<inf>sep</inf>, eventually causing a higher IPCE for the WO<inf>3</inf>(w-Oxa) electrode. The WO<inf>3</inf>(w-Oxa) electrode showed high photocurrent stability (95% maintained for 7 h) and a Faraday efficiency (FE<inf>O<inf>2</inf></inf>) of 95% for water oxidation. The high stability and FE<inf>O<inf>2</inf></inf> for the WO<inf>3</inf>(w-Oxa) electrode result from the suppression of the competed photo-oxidation of the surface by the attenuated hole accumulation due to efficient water oxidation at the (202) facet surface, which is supported by surface energy calculation of the exposed (202), (020) and (200) facets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrochemical Oxidation; Fluorine Doped-tin Oxides; High Charges; Highly Stables; Hydrothermal Methods; Monoclinics; Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation; Structure Directing Agents; Synthesised; Tin Oxide Electrodes; Water Oxidation; Crystal Growth From Melt","Electrochemical oxidation; Fluorine doped-tin oxides; High charges; Highly stables; Hydrothermal methods; Monoclinics; Photoelectrochemical water oxidation; Structure directing agents; Synthesised; Tin oxide electrodes; Water oxidation; Crystal growth from melt","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP21H02042 and JP22K18309.

This study explores 20 two-dimensional Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterobilayers for efficient water splitting. Using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we screen them based on band gaps and intrinsic electric fields to identify promising candidates, then further assess carrier mobility and surface chemistry to fully evaluate their overall performance. By examining the alignment of synthetic and internal electric fields, we distinguish between Type-I, Type-II, and Z-scheme configurations, enabling the targeted design of optimal photocatalytic materials. Furthermore, we employ the Fröhlich interaction model to quantify the mobility contributions from the longitudinal optical phonon mode, providing detailed insights into how carrier mobility, influenced by phonon scattering, affects photocatalytic performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Janus-based Z-scheme systems to overcome existing limitations in photocatalytic water splitting by optimizing the electronic and structural properties of 2D materials, highlighting a viable pathway for advancing clean energy generation through enhanced photocatalytic processes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carrier Mobility; Fröhlich Interaction; Janus Tmdc; Photocatalyst; Water-splitting; Design For Testability; Ferroelectricity; Ionization Of Gases; Light Sensitive Materials; Molecular Dynamics; Photocatalytic Activity; Photolysis; Redox Reactions; Synthetic Metals; Density-functional Theory Calculations; Fröhlich Interaction; Janus Transition-metal Dichalcogenide; Performance; Rational Design; Redox Potentials; Redoxpotential; Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (tmd); Two-dimensional; Water Splitting; Surface Chemistry","Design for testability; Ferroelectricity; Ionization of gases; Light sensitive materials; Molecular dynamics; Photocatalytic activity; Photolysis; Redox reactions; Synthetic metals; Density-functional theory calculations; Fröhlich interaction; Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide; Performance; Rational design; Redox potentials; Redoxpotential; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Two-dimensional; Water splitting; Surface chemistry","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number NCM2024-50-01.","van Thanh, Vuong, Janus γ-GeSSe Monolayer as a High-Performance Material for Photocatalysis and Thermoelectricity, ACS Applied Energy Materials, 6, 2, pp. 910-919, (2023); Trang, Ton Nu Quynh, Manipulating the morphology and charge accumulation driven- Schottky functionalized type II-scheme heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and SERS detection, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 322, (2024); Trang, Ton Nu Quynh, Multifunctional engineering on the ultrasensitive driven-dual plasmonic heterogenous dimer system of 1D semiconductor for accurate SERS sensitivity and quantitation, Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices, 9, 1, (2024); Wang, Wang, S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts based on 2D materials, Materials Today, 81, pp. 137-158, (2024); Ma, Linan, Two-Dimensional van der Waals β-AsP/InS Heterostructure for Photocatalysts, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 128, 43, pp. 18247-18254, (2024); Li, Yu, Photocatalyst design based on two-dimensional materials, Materials Today Chemistry, 11, pp. 197-216, (2019); Roy, Soumyabrata, Engineered Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Energy Conversion and Storage, Chemical Reviews, 124, 16, pp. 9376-9456, (2024); Yuan, Gang, First-Principles Calculations of 2D Janus WSSiN2 Monolayer for Photocatalytic Water Splitting, ACS Applied Nano Materials, 6, 3, pp. 1956-1964, (2023); Tuan Hung, Nguyen, Symmetry breaking in 2D materials for optimizing second-harmonic generation, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 57, 33, (2024); Yuan, Haidong, Tuning the intrinsic electric field of Janus-TMDs to realize high-performance β-Ga2O3 device based on β-Ga2O3/Janus-TMD heterostructures, Materials Today Physics, 21, (2021)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","25740962","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003676098"

This study examined the contribution of Hg release due to artisanal small-scale gold mining in contaminating the sediment of the watershed in Indonesia. Different from other methods, we measured Hg pollution using the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. This report is the first time analytical reports in Indonesia since most papers focus primarily on only detecting heavy metals in river water and sediments, neglecting deep research on Hg pollution and resources. The findings of this study indicate that artisanal and small-scale gold mining activities, located in the upstream areas of the tributaries that act as point sources, are the primary source of mercury in the sediment of the Ciujung watershed. The isotopes δ13C and δ15N successfully trace the Hg-contaminated sediment in the Ciujung watershed derived from the Cisimeut and Ciberang Rivers based on soil organic matter. The biological effect showed the Hg concentration in most of the sampling sites exceeded the effects-range medium and probable effect limit values. The risk quotient values of Hg indicated the Hg pollution had a possibility effect on the benthic organism. Several limitations have also been added in this study and needs for further investigation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artisanal Small-scale Gold Mining; Ciujung; Mercury; Sediment","","","","","Jurnal Teknologi Reaktor Nuklir, (2012); Advances in Social Science Education and Humanities Research Proceedings of the 1st International Multidisciplinary Conference on Education Technology and Engineering, (2019); J Water Sustain, (2013); Libassi, Matthew, Indonesia: Adaptation and Differentiation in Informal Gold Mining, pp. 321-338, (2020); Getriana, Astri, Behavioral mercury exposure of people in artisanal and small-scale gold mining site area at lebaksitu village, 2017, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development, 9, 6, pp. 433-438, (2018); Fundamental Toxicological Sciences, (2020); Böse-O'Reilly, Stephan, A preliminary study on health effects in villagers exposed to mercury in a small-scale artisanal gold mining area in Indonesia, Environmental Research, 149, pp. 274-281, (2016); Hong, Young-seoub, Methylmercury exposure and health effects, Journal of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, 45, 6, pp. 353-363, (2012); Kim, Tae-hun, Methylmercury determination in fish by direct mercury analyzer, Journal of AOAC International, 103, 1, pp. 244-249, (2021); Gutiérrez-Mosquera, Harry, Distribution of chemical forms of mercury in sediments from abandoned ponds created during former gold mining operations in Colombia, Chemosphere, 258, (2020)","","Saint-Petersburg Mining University","","","","","","24113336; 25419404","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005887110"

This study introduces for the first time a sustainable fabrication of porous carbon from Kraft lignin using K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> as an environment-friendly activator via a spray drying approach and carbonization process. K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> offers a low-toxic, low-corrosive, and eco-friendly alternative to KOH, making it safer for long-term equipment use and more suitable for large-scale applications. Furthermore, K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> effectively creates a microporous structure for CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption while simplifying waste management due to its benign and recyclable carbonate residues. Unlike conventional two-step activation, our approach integrates carbonization and activation into a single step, reducing production time and enhancing efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications. Porous carbon materials obtained through this novel process exhibited a CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption capacity of 4.54 mmol/g at 298 K, comparable to those activated with KOH and outperforming many previously reported adsorbents. Additionally, the effects of K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> concentration and carbonization temperature were systematically studied to optimize CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption performance.

This paper presents a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) approach to solve the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in microgrids, focusing on the combined use of RES, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and Incentive-Based Demand Response (IBDR) programs. The proposed model optimizes power generation scheduling for both grid-connected and isolated microgrid modes. To assess customer satisfaction in IBDR programs, a Fuzzy Logic Model evaluates key factors like load demand, freedom of time, electricity prices, and incentives. This model aims to minimize operating costs when IBDR is not applied or maximize social welfare when IBDR is implemented. Results, obtained using Matlab/Simulink for customer satisfaction modeling and the CPLEX solver in Python for UC optimization, demonstrate that integrating BESS and IBDR enhances system flexibility and resilience to RES fluctuations. In optimal grid-connected operation, the model achieves a 22.27% reduction in operating costs and a 28.95% increase in social welfare compared to isolated operations. Although customer electricity bills rise by 15.35%, increased satisfaction, and system stability underscore the overall benefits of integrating BESS and IBDR for both operators and consumers. These findings demonstrate the potential of this approach to significantly enhance microgrid performance and ensure greater reliability in practical implementations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battery Energy Storage System; Fuzzy Logic Model; Incentives-based Demand Response; Microgrid; Renewable Energy Sources; Unit Commitment; Battery Storage; Integer Programming; Microgrids; Mixed-integer Linear Programming; Quadratic Programming; Uranium Carbide; Battery Energy Storage Systems; Customers' Satisfaction; Demand Response Programs; Fuzzy Logic Modeling; Incentive-based Demand Response; Integration Of Renewable Energies; Microgrid; Renewable Energy Source; Social Welfare; Unit Commitment; Customer Satisfaction","Battery storage; Integer programming; Microgrids; Mixed-integer linear programming; Quadratic programming; Uranium carbide; Battery energy storage systems; Customers' satisfaction; Demand response programs; Fuzzy logic modeling; Incentive-based demand response; Integration of renewable energies; Microgrid; Renewable energy source; Social welfare; Unit Commitment; Customer satisfaction","","","","Cired Workshop, (2018); Technical Report Nrel Tp 6a20 79236, (2021); U S Benefits of Demand Response in Electricity Markets and Recommendations for Achieving Them, (2005); Scheller, Fabian, Provoking Residential Demand Response Through Variable Electricity Tariffs - A Model-Based Assessment for Municipal Energy Utilities, Technology and Economics of Smart Grids and Sustainable Energy, 3, 1, (2018); Morales-España, Germán Andrés, Classifying and modelling demand response in power systems, Energy, 242, (2022); Wang, Liying, Demand response comprehensive incentive mechanism-based multi-time scale optimization scheduling for park integrated energy system, Energy, 270, (2023); Štrbac, Goran, Demand side management: Benefits and challenges, Energy Policy, 36, 12, pp. 4419-4426, (2008); Aghaei, Jamshid, Contribution of emergency demand response programs in power system reliability, Energy, 103, pp. 688-696, (2016); N., A fuzzy chance-constrained program for unit commitment problem considering demand response, electric vehicle and wind power, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 65, pp. 201-209, (2015); Mansourshoar, Paria, Impact of implementing a price-based demand response program on the system reliability in security-constrained unit commitment problem coupled with wind farms in the presence of contingencies, Energy, 255, (2022)","","Springer","","","","","","27318087","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218207805"

This study demonstrates a cascading use of biochar associated with phytolith, first for H<inf>2</inf>S removal from biogas and subsequently as a slow-release source of Si, S and P. Biochar associated with phytolith, referred to as ‘CharPhyt’, was prepared through anaerobic pyrolysis of rice straw and subsequently tested for its capacity to remove H<inf>2</inf>S from farm biogas. The resulting S-sorbed charPhyt, referred to as charPhytS, was then used to track the release of Si, S, P and other nutrient elements. CharPhyt demonstrated effective performance in H<inf>2</inf>S removal by converting H<inf>2</inf>S gas into a solid form. This solid S layer likely acted to reduce the release rates of Si and P. After a 7-day batch experiment, the release rates of Si and P from charPhytS were 9.65 and 0.04 mg/L, respectively. These release rates were ca. 4 and 10 times (respectively) lower than those from charPhyt, which were 39.6 and 0.4 mg/L. The enrichment of S on the surface of charPhyt is proposed as an underlying mechanism through which S likely inhibits the releases of Si and P. In contrast, S maintains an acidic environment, promoting protonation and cation exchange processes, which in turn enhance the release of K, Ca, Mg and Mn.

However, practical application of TEGs is constrained by the limited thermoelectric performance of traditional materials like bismuth telluride (Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf>)-based thermoelectric materials. Thick thermoelectric films frequently suffer from cracking, leading to reduced reliability and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this study investigates the incorporation of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) into Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf>-based thermoelectric films. CNF, a sustainable and biodegradable material, was hypothesized to improve thermoelectric performance by reducing thermal conductivity through enhanced phonon scattering while maintaining favorable electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. Crack-free CNF-Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf> composite films (400 μm thick) were synthesized using a pulsed electrodeposition method. Structural analysis confirmed that CNF introduced significant microstructural improvements, including grain refinement, enhanced grain boundary scattering, and optimized carrier transport pathways. At an optimal CNF concentration of 0.06 wt%, the ZT value of the composite films reached 0.76, representing a 625% improvement over the pure Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf> film. This remarkable enhancement was achieved through a significant reduction in thermal conductivity and balanced improvements in electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. These results highlight the potential of CNF as an effective additive for improving both the thermoelectric efficiency and structural integrity of Bi<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>3</inf>-based materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bismuth Telluride; Cellulose Nanofibers; Micro-thermoelectric Generator; Nanocomposite; Thermoelectric Materials; Cellulose Films; Electrochemical Deposition; Grain Boundaries; Nanocellulose; Nanocomposite Films; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Tellurium Compounds; Thermal Conductivity Of Solids; Thick Films; Waste Heat Utilization; Bismuth Telluride; Cellulose Nanofibers; Electrical Conductivity; Micro-thermoelectric Generator; Thermal; Thermo-electric Materials; Thermoelectric Film; Thermoelectric Generators; Thermoelectric Material; Thermoelectric Performance; Grain Refinement; Bismuth; Efficiency; Grain; Materials; Performance; Scattering; Tellurium Compounds; Thermal Conductivity","Cellulose films; Electrochemical deposition; Grain boundaries; Nanocellulose; Nanocomposite films; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Tellurium compounds; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thick films; Waste heat utilization; Bismuth telluride; Cellulose nanofibers; Electrical conductivity; Micro-thermoelectric generator; Thermal; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermoelectric film; Thermoelectric generators; Thermoelectric material; Thermoelectric performance; Grain refinement; Bismuth; Efficiency; Grain; Materials; Performance; Scattering; Tellurium Compounds; Thermal Conductivity","","","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant No. 23K03706), the Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Area (Grant No. 24H02231), the JST/ASPIRE Program (Grant No. JPMJAP2413), and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (Grant No. JP21zf0127001).

Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with Central Composite Design (CCD) was employed to optimize the cultivation conditions for Brassica juncea using the composted fertilizer. Results demonstrated that Trichoderma spp. significantly accelerated decomposition and improved fertilizer quality. Among the tested parameters, composting duration and fertilization rate significantly influenced plant growth, particularly leaf length and width, while microbial inoculant concentration had no notable effect. Microbial analysis confirmed that Coliform, E. coli, and Salmonella levels were below regulatory limits (ND 108/2017/ND-CP), with none detected in fertilizers produced with Trichoderma spp.. RSM optimization identified the optimal composting conditions as 18 days, 4 wt.% Trichoderma spp., and 50 v/v% fertilizer volume fraction.

Bimetallic Co–Cu catalysts were loaded onto HY Zeolite supports at varying molar ratios of the metals and used for catalytic cracking. The effects of varying parameters, such as reaction temperatures from 140 to 200 °C and reaction times between 1 and 4 h, on the catalytic activity were investigated. The synergistic interactions between Co and Cu regulate the catalytic reactions by balancing the oxidative and hydrolytic pathways for cleaving the intermolecular bonds of lignin. At 180 °C temperature and 2 h of reaction time, the total yield of the compounds obtained from lignin derivatives (phenolics, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) increased to approximately 34.25 % for the Co:Cu molar ratio of 4:1. Further, the phenol yield remarkably increased from 0.45 to 2.86 % by changing the Co:Cu molar ratio from 1:1 to 4:1, respectively. This synergistic effect enhanced product yields and improved metal dispersion and catalytic stability, contributing to a more efficient biomass conversion process. The reusability studies revealed that the yield of lignin-derived compounds was approximately 90 % of the initial run, even after four consecutive cycles, confirming the long-term applicability of the catalyst. Hence, this catalyst system can be a promising alternative for biomass conversion for synthesizing phenolic compounds owing to its several advantages, including the high yield of lignin derivatives and remarkable catalytic stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Co–cu Catalyst; Fractionation; Lignin; Oxidation; Bioconversion; Copper; Molar Ratio; Bimetallics; Catalytic Stability; Co-cu Catalysts; Lignin Derivatives; Liquid-phase Oxidation; Palm Kernel Shells; Waste Biomass; [co/cu]; ]+ Catalyst; Biomass; Catalyst; Fractionation; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lignin; Oxidation; Waste Technology; Biomass; Conversion; Lignins; Shells; Stability; Wastes; Yield","Bioconversion; Copper; Molar ratio; Bimetallics; Catalytic stability; Co-cu catalysts; Lignin derivatives; Liquid-phase oxidation; Palm kernel shells; Waste biomass; [Co/Cu]; ]+ catalyst; biomass; catalyst; fractionation; hydrogen peroxide; lignin; oxidation; waste technology; Biomass; Conversion; Lignins; Shells; Stability; Wastes; Yield","","","","Liu, Xiaoqing, Heterogeneous photocatalytic conversion of biomass to biofuels: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 476, (2023); Feng, Juan, Utilization of agricultural wastes for co-production of xylitol, ethanol, and phenylacetylcarbinol: A review, Bioresource Technology, 392, (2024); Verma, Ashwani Kumar, Bioprospecting lignin for biorefinery: Emerging innovations and strategies in microbial technology, Biomass and Bioenergy, 181, (2024); Xu, Quanzhou, Structure regulation of lignin-derived N-doped carbon-supported Ni catalyst for efficient upgrading of ethanol to higher alcohols, Chemical Engineering Journal, 489, (2024); Ding, Tao, Promoted Production of Phenolic Monomers from Lignin-First Depolymerization of Lignocellulose over Ru Supported on Biochar by N,P-co-Doping, ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, 10, 7, pp. 2343-2354, (2022); Das, Anindita, Optimization of lignin extraction from bamboo by ultrasound-assisted organosolv pretreatment, Bioresource Technology, 376, (2023); Midhun Kumar, M., Selective production of guaiacol from lignin via catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis using Ru-Cu/Zirconia, Molecular Catalysis, 530, (2022); Lee, Doyeon, Recent progress in the catalytic thermochemical conversion process of biomass for biofuels, Chemical Engineering Journal, 447, (2022); Totong, Sansanee, Catalytic depolymerization of alkaline lignin to value-added phenolic-based compounds over Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst synthesized with a one-step chemical reduction of Ni species using NaBH4 as the reducing agent, Fuel Processing Technology, 198, (2020); Wu, Yun, Efficient Lignin Depolymerization Process for Phenolic Products with Lignin-Based Catalysts and Mixed Solvents, Energy and Fuels, 37, 7, pp. 5206-5219, (2023)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18732909; 09619534","","BMSBE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214322877"

The reaction was investigated using a tandem micro-reactor connected to a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) system, encompassing both in-situ and ex-situ studies. Fe oxide/HY and Cu oxide/HY catalysts, prepared via a metal–organic framework (MOF)-incorporated technique, demonstrated excellent metal dispersion and enhanced electron density. The Cu oxide/HY catalyst showed significant production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, reaching up to 28% in in-situ studies. Owing to its strong acid sites, this catalyst facilitated the formation of aromatic compounds. In ex-situ studies, furan and acetaldehyde were consumed through the Diels–Alder reaction. The increase in aromatic compounds was highlighted by a synergistic effect percentage as high as 175%. The mechanism of aromatic formation was elucidated through dealkylation, Diels–Alder, and aromatization reactions. The Cu oxide/HY catalyst, combined with the MOF-incorporated preparation technique presents a promising system for catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and HDPE.

However, the adoption of organic fertilizers among farming households has been slow, spontaneous, and fragmented. The absence of credible information and advisory sources is reported to be a critical constraint. The sharing of information and experiences among social networks is expected to play an important role in overcoming this constraint, although strong causal evidence remains scarce. Therefore, this study employs an instrumental variable approach with observational village-census data to identify the causal impacts of social networks on the adoption of organic fertilizers and explores the underlying information-sharing mechanism within social networks, providing rich information about existing social networks for both men and women separately. The estimation results show that in farming households, the wife's social networks have a positive and significant effect on the diffusion of organic fertilizers.

The capability to predict electricity demand that captures stochastic variances and uncertainties is significantly important in the planning, operation and regulation of national electricity markets. This study has proposed an explainable deeply-fused nets electricity demand prediction model that factors in the climate-based predictors for enhanced accuracy and energy market insight analysis, generating point-based and confidence interval predictions of daily electricity demand. The proposed hybrid approach is built using Deeply Fused Nets (FNET) that comprises of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BILSTM) Network with residual connection. The study then contributes to a new deep fusion model that integrates intermediate representations of the base networks (fused output being the input of the remaining part of each base network) to perform these combinations deeply over several intermediate representations to enhance the demand predictions. The results are evaluated with statistical metrics and graphical representations of predicted and observed electricity demand, benchmarked with standalone models i.e., BILSTM, LSTMCNN, deep neural network, multi-layer perceptron, multivariate adaptive regression spline, kernel ridge regression and Gaussian process of regression. The end part of the proposed FNET model applies residual bootstrapping where final residuals are computed from predicted and observed demand to generate the 95% prediction intervals, analysed using probabilistic metrics to quantify the uncertainty associated with FNETS objective model. To enhance the FNET model's transparency, the SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) method has been applied to elucidate the relationships between electricity demand and climate-based predictor variables.

Breed-and-burn systems, in particular, have the potential to efficiently utilize uranium fuel, which could lead to a reduction in nuclear waste and eliminate the need for expensive fuel reprocessing facilities. In this paper, we design a core for a Rotational Fuel-shuffling Breed-and-Burn reactor with Silicide fuel and Sodium coolant (RFBB-SS). To demonstrate the core’s fuel cycle features, we then analyze the reactor burnup parameters through neutronic calculations. Then, to reveal its safety features, the control rod assembly worth and the maximum temperatures of the reactor domains were estimated. The results showed that a small start-up core for an RFBB-SS design is feasible and that the maximum temperatures of the fuel cell domains in a hot channel can be kept well below their safety limits. Hence, the reactor could achieve a subcritical state when all control rod assemblies are inserted into the core. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Breed-and-burn Fast Reactor; Burnup Performance; Control Rod Assembly; Rfbb; Rotational Fuel Shuffling Scheme; Silicide Fuel; Sodium Coolant; Lawrencium; Mendelevium; Nuclear Fuels; Reactor Cores; Reactor Refueling; Reactor Startup; Silicides; Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors; Breed And Burns; Breed-and-burn Fast Reactor; Burn Up; Burnup Performance; Burnups; Control Rod Assembly; Performance; Rfbb; Rotational Fuel Shuffling Scheme; Silicide Fuel; Sodium Coolant; Control Rods","Lawrencium; Mendelevium; Nuclear fuels; Reactor cores; Reactor refueling; Reactor startup; Silicides; Sodium-cooled fast reactors; Breed and burns; Breed-and-burn fast reactor; Burn up; Burnup performance; Burnups; Control rod assembly; Performance; RFBB; Rotational fuel shuffling scheme; Silicide fuel; Sodium coolant; Control rods","","","The work was supported by the\u00A0National University of Mongolia [P2023\u20134611].","Proc Int Congress Adv Nucl Power Plants, (2010); Gilleland, John, The Traveling Wave Reactor: Design and Development, Engineering, 2, 1, pp. 88-96, (2016); Hejzlar, Pavel, Terrapower, LLC traveling wave reactor development program overview, Nuclear Engineering and Technology, 45, 6, pp. 731-744, (2013); López-Solís, Roberto Carlos, The breed and burn nuclear reactor: A chronological, conceptual, and technological review, International Journal of Energy Research, 42, 3, pp. 953-965, (2018); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, A new reactor burnup concept “candle”, (2000); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, CANDLE: The new burnup strategy, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 139, 3, pp. 306-317, (2001); Arwif 2001, (2001); Light A Candle, (2010); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, Application of CANDLE burnup strategy for future nuclear energy utilization, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 47, 1-4, pp. 91-98, (2005); Osato, Hiroki, Initial core design of CANDLE burning fast reactor using plutonium from LWR spent fuel, Annals of Nuclear Energy, 120, pp. 501-508, (2018)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","00223131; 18811248","","JNSTA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216479195"

However, the hybrid quantum-classical model can recover this weakness by using the advantage of qubits. In this study, we upgrade a quantum image compression algorithm within parameterized quantum circuits. Our approach encodes image data as unitary operator parameters and applies the quantum compilation algorithm to emulate the encryption process. By utilizing first-order Taylor expansion, we significantly reduce both the computational cost and loss, better than the previous version. Experimental results on benchmark images, including Lenna and Cameraman, show that our method achieves up to 86% reduction in the number of iterations while maintaining a lower compression loss, better for high-resolution images. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm provides an efficient and scalable image compression mechanism, making it a promising candidate for future image processing applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Image Encryption; Quantum Compilation; Quantum Image Processing; Taylor Approximation; Cryptography; Expansion; Image Quality; Iterative Methods; Quantum Optics; Qubits; Taylor Series; Classical Modeling; Image Compression Algorithms; Image Compression Methods; Images Encryptions; Quantum Compilation; Quantum Image Processing; Quantum Images; Quantum-classical; Taylor Approximation; Taylor's Expansion; Image Compression","Cryptography; Expansion; Image quality; Iterative methods; Quantum optics; Qubits; Taylor series; Classical modeling; Image compression algorithms; Image compression methods; Images encryptions; Quantum compilation; Quantum image processing; Quantum images; Quantum-classical; Taylor approximation; Taylor's expansion; Image compression","","","This work is supported by the VNUHCM-University of Information Technology's Scientific Research Support Fund under Grant No. D1-2023-48.","Discrete Cosine Transform in Jpeg Compression, (2021); Shensa, Mark J., The Discrete Wavelet Transform: Wedding the À Trous and Mallat Algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 40, 10, pp. 2464-2482, (1992); Liu, Jerry, Conditional Entropy Coding for Efficient Video Compression, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12362 LNCS, pp. 453-468, (2020); Lv, Chuanfeng, A universal PCA for image compression, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3824 LNCS, pp. 910-919, (2005); Selimovic, Alena, Analysis of Content-Aware Image Compression with VGG16, (2018); Mentzer, Fabian, Practical full resolution learned lossless image compression, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019-June, pp. 10621-10630, (2019); Zhang, Xi, Ultra High Fidelity Deep Image Decompression with l∞-Constrained Compression, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 30, pp. 963-975, (2021); Toderici, George D., Full resolution image compression with recurrent neural networks, 2017-January, pp. 5435-5443, (2017); Supervised Learning with Quantum Computers, (2018); Khatri, Sumeet, Quantum-assisted quantum compiling, Quantum, 3, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","22nd International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2025","","Bangkok; Montien Hotel Surawong","211211","","9798331522230","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014398853"

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved the accuracy of ECG disease classification. However, existing CNN-based accelerators face challenges such as high area usage due to large parameter counts and slow processing speeds. This paper introduces the Tiny InceptionNet Accelerator (TINA), a fast and memory-efficient CNN accelerator for ECG classification, which reduces the parameter count by 43.42% compared to the smallest existing 1-D CNN. TINA incorporates three novel features: a dual Processing Element Array (D-PEA) for parallel processing of 80 multiply-accumulation (MAC) operations in the convolutional layer and other necessary operations in subsequent layers, a shared pixel distributor (SPD) for dynamic data coordination, and shared pixel memory between the PEAs to optimize area usage. TINA has been successfully implemented and verified on the ZCU102 FPGA.

By facilitating Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading, the proposed platform ensures mutually beneficial outcomes, particularly in the presence of advanced energy resources such as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) and Demand Response Programs (DRPs). From the perspective of power systems, P2P energy trading enhances local energy balancing and promotes self-sufficiency within MG networks. Unlike traditional noncooperative game models, where participants act independently, this study adopts a cooperative game approach that aligns with the autonomous and self-interested nature of MGs. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the platform, demonstrating that MGs can engage in energy trading while achieving economic benefits. Fur-thermore, the platform determines optimal pricing and energy trading volumes, ensuring that participants gain measurable eco-nomic advantages in the P2P market.

However, the upper flange must be reinforced from below due to the presence of slabs on the upper surface. Recently, carbon fiber has been used as a reinforcement material, but the vertical stiffeners installed beneath the upper flange hinder the continuous application of carbon fiber along the girder axis. The study proposed a reinforcement method for the underside of the upper flange, even in areas with vertical stiffeners, by bonding CFRP molded plate with notches designed to bypass the vertical stiffeners. Bending tests were performed on steel girder specimens reinforced using the proposed method to evaluate the reinforcement effect.

In this study, we utilized a designed Mott–Schottky material, Au/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, developed in conjunction with a low-cost and robust material: carbon cloth. The findings revealed that 30 min of ultraviolet exposure is optimal for depositing Au nanoparticles, achieving the best balance between maximizing the Au loading content and minimizing the potential photochemical corrosion of Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>. The CC-30 material exhibited low overpotentials of 121 mV for the HER and 160 mV for the OER in 1.0 M KOH. Consequently, the overall water-splitting process necessitated a low cell voltage of 1.51 V. Remarkably, the electrode maintained excellent durability, with a negligible increase of 0.06 V after 100 h of continuous electrolysis in a 3 M KOH solution. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis during the reaction demonstrated that Au promotes faster charge transfer and stabilizes a higher Co2+ ratio during the HER, facilitating redox transformations. Notably, in the OER, the Au/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> interface accelerates the transition from Co3+ to Co4+, promoting the formation of a –C=O intermediate and enabling –O–O– detachment, which enhances gas evolution kinetics. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation revealed that various Au(111) and Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>(111) interface structures result in opposite charge redistributions at the interface. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gold Nanoparticles; Photodegradation; Redox Reactions; A-carbon; Bifunctional Electrocatalysts; Carbon Cloths; Catalytic Materials; Evolution Reactions; Hydrogen Evolution Reactions; Hydrogen-evolution; Mott-schottky; Oxygen Evolution; Water Splitting; Potassium Hydroxide","Gold nanoparticles; Photodegradation; Redox reactions; A-carbon; Bifunctional electrocatalysts; Carbon cloths; Catalytic materials; Evolution reactions; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Hydrogen-evolution; Mott-Schottky; Oxygen evolution; Water splitting; Potassium hydroxide","","","We would like to thank CM Thi Laboratory, HUTECH University, for supporting facilities in this study.

However, the effectiveness of Q-ratio diminishes in the low-energy region (below 150 keVee) due to overlapping signal, leading to a suboptimal figure of merit (FOM). In this study, we use machine-learning (ML) technique, particularly the 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), to enhance the neutron/gamma discrimination and compares the results with the traditional charge integration ratio in the low-energy region. Our investigation focuses on the EJ-276 plastic scintillator, a commercial product of ELJEN technology known for its good separation of gamma and fast neutron signals based on timing characteristics. Experimental data were acquired using 252Cf and 60Co radioisotope sources. A comprehensive comparative analysis between the traditional Q-ratio method and ML algorithms is conducted for the low-energy region.

The previous single-material diffusion bonded loop heat pipes were made of copper, leading to a high heat leak due to high thermal conductivity, causing a reduction in efficiency. This research used a new approach that separated the evaporator from the loop heat pipe while using diffusion bonding to manufacture a loop heat pipe using two materials, copper and stainless steel. This separation allowed for lower thermal conductivity materials to be used to help reduce the heat leak. Two evaporators with different wicks were tested, one made of copper and the other made of polytetrafluoroethylene. Both designs were tested in multiple orientations and operated for a range of 15 W to 45 W with an evaporator to condenser thermal resistance ranging from 2.18 °C/W to 0.004 °C/W. Additionally, a numerical model was developed to predict the performance of both evaporators, with an average temperature difference ranging from 5.5 °C to 6.6 °C for all thermocouple locations. The heat leak ratio was analyzed using the model, and a heat leak ratio of 7.6% to 8.0% and 13.6% to 16.0% for the copper wick and polytetrafluoroethylene wick loop heat pipe was calculated, respectively. This research demonstrates that diffusion bonding copper with a lower thermal conductivity material and using low thermal conductivity sealing material can help reduce the heat leak within diffusion bonded loop heat pipes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heat Pipes; Heat Resistance; Sealing (finishing); Thermal Conductivity Of Solids; Thermocouples; % Reductions; Experimental Investigations; Heat Leaks; High Thermal Conductivity; Loop Heat Pipe; Low Thermal Conductivity; Manufacturing Techniques; Numerical Investigations; Property; Thermal; Diffusion Bonding","Heat pipes; Heat resistance; Sealing (finishing); Thermal conductivity of solids; Thermocouples; % reductions; Experimental investigations; Heat leaks; High thermal conductivity; Loop Heat Pipe; Low thermal conductivity; Manufacturing techniques; Numerical investigations; Property; Thermal; Diffusion bonding","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [Grant Number 23H00211].","Koengkan, Matheus, The Impact of Battery-Electric Vehicles on Energy Consumption: A Macroeconomic Evidence from 29 European Countries, World Electric Vehicle Journal, 13, 2, (2022); Dong, Xue, CO2 emission of electric and gasoline vehicles under various road conditions for China, Japan, Europe and world average-prediction through year 2040, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 9, 11, (2019); Canals Casals, Lluc, Sustainability analysis of the electric vehicle use in Europe for CO2 emissions reduction, Journal of Cleaner Production, 127, pp. 425-437, (2016); Li, Lifu, Acceleration curve optimization for electric vehicle based on energy consumption and battery life, Energy, 169, pp. 1039-1053, (2019); Okamoto, Atsushi, On-orbit Experiment Plan of Loop Heat Pipe and the Test Results of Ground Test, Microgravity Science and Technology, 31, 3, pp. 327-337, (2019); Wang, Xianling, Visualization study of a flat confined loop heat pipe for electronic devices cooling, Applied Energy, 322, (2022); Zhao, Xudong, Theoretical investigation of the performance of a novel loop heat pipe solar water heating system for use in Beijing, China, Applied Thermal Engineering, 30, 16, pp. 2526-2536, (2010); Huang, Bin Juine, Low-cost manufacturing of loop heat pipe for commercial applications, Applied Thermal Engineering, 126, pp. 1091-1097, (2017); Aono, Yoshitada, Development of a loop heat pipe with kW-class heat transport capability, Applied Thermal Engineering, 183, (2021); Wu, Tong, Experimental investigation on the start-up performance of a loop heat pipe with three flat disk evaporators combined, Applied Thermal Engineering, 216, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","13594311","","ATENF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205148999"

A semi-structured interview survey was conducted with 27 candidates in Vietnam. Interview items included reasons for choosing the training program in Japan, the desired length of stay, expectations, and career advancement after returning home. Descriptive statistics and K-means clustering were used to analyze the data. Survey results showed that all participants independently decided to pursue care worker training in Japan; 44% had considered other countries; most wanted to stay in Japan for as long as possible; and 37% wanted to live in Japan permanently. The K-means method revealed three clusters: a Japanophile cluster (preferred Japan for its landscape, culture, and national character); a word-of-mouth cluster (influenced by personal referrals); and an intellectual cluster (influenced by Japan’s economic development and care levels). Our findings indicate that support for obtaining qualifications, Japanese language skills, and caregiving skills are important to secure the stability of foreign care workers.

This energy poverty, particularly among the elderly, continues to affect well-being and health as the population ages. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty on the life satisfaction of elderly individuals, using data from the 2011 Vietnam National Aging Survey. As one of the first studies to explore this relationship in Vietnam, it contributes to the literature by providing valuable empirical evidence of the causal link between energy poverty and life satisfaction, shedding light on the mechanisms behind the observed effects. By adopting a multidimensional approach, we measure energy poverty across three distinct thresholds. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we employ a two-stage least squares regression, using provincial-level information and communications technology infrastructure as an instrumental variable. Our findings consistently demonstrate that energy poverty significantly and negatively impacts the life satisfaction of the elderly across all three measures. To ensure the robustness of our results, we conduct additional tests, including alternative constructions of energy poverty and the use of different instrumental variables, such as the number of Internet users per 100 population at the provincial level. We further validate our conclusions through other methods, including plausible exogenous instrumental variables and double/debiased machine learning, confirming the stability and reliability of our findings. Additionally, we identify two key pathways through which energy poverty affects life satisfaction: physical health and mental health.

We propose a set of indicators suitable to Vietnam’s social-ecological conditions based on the IUCN concepts of management effectiveness and the consultation dialogues with relevant BR stakeholders. This set includes 58 indicators, 20 headline indicators according to 6 management elements of BR: Context, Planning, Inputs, Process, Outputs and Outcomes. Management effectiveness value is divided into 5 levels (0, 25, 50, 75, 100) and thereafter categorised into 4 ranges according to the corresponding value (Very low: 0–25 points; Low: 25–50 points; Average: 50–75 points; High: 75–100 points) with the higher the value, the greater the effectiveness. Based on the indicators, we evaluated the management effectiveness of Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An BR (designated in 2009). The results of evaluating management effectiveness for this BR have determined that the overall management effectiveness for the whole BR is 78.2 out of 100 scores, equivalent to high management effectiveness. Results for management elements: element 1 (Context-85.8 score), element 2 (Planning-83.5 score), element 3 (Inputs-73.4 score), element 4 (Process-76.3 score), element 5 (Outputs-68.3 score) and element 6 (Outcomes-81.9 score). Although the indicators presented a useful analysis of management effectiveness in this particular case, owing the diversity of BRs in Vietnam in terms of socio-ecological conditions, total area, governance model and administration, caution should be applied in the treatment and/or selection of these indicators for all BR cases and the 58 indicators should be used as a guide for each specific BR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biosphere Reserves; Cu Lao Cham-hoi An; Evaluation; Management Effectiveness Indicators; Sustainable Development; Vietnam; Biosphere; Environmental Planning; Management Practice; Nature Reserve; Sustainable Development; Unesco; Viet Nam","biosphere; environmental planning; management practice; nature reserve; sustainable development; UNESCO; Viet Nam","","","We thank the Project \u201CResearch on the theoretical and practical basis and propose a guiding framework for management of world biosphere reserves recognized by UNESCO in Vietnam\u201D Code DTDLXH-06/21 and \u201CThe Japan Prize Heisei Memorial Grant\u201D (PI: Toshinori Tanaka) for financial and technical support to conduct this research.","Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, (1996); German Commission for Unesco Management Manual for Unesco Biosphere Reserves in Africa A Practical Guide for Managers, (2015); Unesco Mab Technical Guidelines for Biosphere Reserves, (2021); Unesco Mab Madrid Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves, (2008); Unesco Mab Mab Strategic Action Plan 20152025, (2015); Lima Action Plan, (2016); World Network of Biosphere Reserves, (2024); Evaluating Effectiveness A Framework for Assessing the Management of Protected Areas, (2000); International Journal of Unesco Biosphere Reserves, (2017); Unesco Biosphere Reserves Supporting Biocultural Diversity Sustainability and Society, (2019)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629984","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202731923"

However, the poor quality of input data, which is very common in practical circumstances owing to the low-cost measurement and data acquisition devices, poses an enormous challenge for the predictive model to deeply extract the spatial and temporal correlation of the input data. This study proposes a Multi Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN) for short-term PV power forecast embedded with Laplacian Attention mechanism. By viewing the input sequences in a 2D form, the input map is constructed, and the interconnected feature among variables can be captured by convolution operation. Moreover, with the multiple CNN layers working in parallel architecture, different representations hidden inside the input map can be detected, enabling the proposed model to bring out promising performance across forecast time-step without modifying its initial parameters. In order to reduce the decay impact of irrelevant variables existing inside the input data, the Laplacian Attention mechanism is employed. The Attention matrix is dynamically modified during the training process to produce an accurate attention matrix, which represents the correlation between variables. Therefore, the model is able to focus on informative features and ignore negative ones. The experiments conducted on two different datasets with opposite characteristics provide deep insights into the strength of the proposed model over the baseline model, which strongly demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed model, especially when dealing with datasets bearing tough characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d-cnn; Laplacian Attention Mechanism; Multi-convolution; Multi-horizon; Pv Power Forecast; Data Acquisition; Forecasting; Input Output Programs; Laplace Transforms; Matrix Algebra; Parallel Architectures; Power Quality; 2d-cnn; Attention Mechanisms; Input Datas; Laplacian Attention Mechanism; Laplacians; Multi-convolution; Multi-horizon; Photovoltaic Power; Photovoltaic Power Forecast; Power Forecast; Convolution","Data acquisition; Forecasting; Input output programs; Laplace transforms; Matrix algebra; Parallel architectures; Power quality; 2d-CNN; Attention mechanisms; Input datas; Laplacian attention mechanism; Laplacians; Multi-convolution; Multi-horizon; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaic power forecast; Power forecast; Convolution","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam under project number T2022-PC-001.","Agga, Ali, CNN-LSTM: An efficient hybrid deep learning architecture for predicting short-term photovoltaic power production, Electric Power Systems Research, 208, (2022); Ahmed, Razin, A review and evaluation of the state-of-the-art in PV solar power forecasting: Techniques and optimization, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 124, (2020); Bondugula, Rohit Kumar, Intelligent analysis of multimedia healthcare data using natural language processing and deep-learning techniques, pp. 335-358, (2022); Das, Utpal Kumar, SVR-based model to forecast PV power generation under differentweather conditions, Energies, 10, 7, (2017); Ding, Dong, Non-intrusive load monitoring method with inception structured CNN, Applied Intelligence, 52, 6, pp. 6227-6244, (2022); Fantidis, J.

This study examines the heating dynamics and critical self-ignition temperatures (CSITs) of Baiyinhua lignite stockpiles through wire-mesh basket (WMB) tests at two scales. The CSC process in coal stockpiles unfolds in four stages. Notably, Stage II is notable for significant moisture evaporation between 43 and 84 °C, while Stage IV marks the onset of self-heating. Moisture evaporation absorbs heat, linearly prolonging the Stage II duration, which accounts for 0%–70 % of the total time. Conversely, larger particle sizes enhance pore seepage, effectively shortening the heating time. The time for d = 20 mm (particle size) coal sample to reach ambient temperature is roughly half that of 1.5 mm. CSITs of raw coal increase by 10–15 °C compared to the dry coal, and CSIT of coal samples with d = 50 mm has increased by 17.5 °C compared to 10 mm. Therefore, both an increase in particle size and moisture content increase the CSIT, thereby reducing the propensity for CSC. Frank-Kamenetskii theory and dimensionless analysis predict spontaneous combustion risks in field-scale coal stockpiles. This investigation contributes valuable insights to the estimation and prevention of CSC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lignite; Moisture; Particle Size; Spontaneous Combustion; Wire-mesh Basket Test; Coal Combustion; Concrete Construction; Lignite; Risk Analysis; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Spontaneous Combustion; %moisture; Coal Sample; Coal Spontaneous Combustion; Coal Stockpiles; Combustion Characteristics; Moisture Evaporation; Particles Sizes; Self-ignition Temperature; Wire Meshes; Wire-mesh Basket Test; Coal Industry; Coal Combustion; Evaporation; Heating; Lignite; Moisture Content; Particle Size; Temperature Effect; Testing Method","Coal combustion; Concrete construction; Lignite; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Spontaneous combustion; %moisture; Coal sample; Coal spontaneous combustion; Coal stockpiles; Combustion characteristics; Moisture evaporation; Particles sizes; Self-ignition temperature; Wire meshes; Wire-mesh basket test; Coal industry; coal combustion; evaporation; heating; lignite; moisture content; particle size; temperature effect; testing method","","","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (52304220, 52250410338), Scientific research project of Education Department of Liaoning Province (LJKMZ20220667), Research Funding of Liaoning Education Department, 2021(LJKQZ2021132), Joint Funding of the Department of Science & Technology of Liaoning Province (2023JH2/101700008).","Zhang, Xun, Experimental study on effect of mudstone on spontaneous combustion of coal, Energy, 285, (2023); Zhang, Hemeng, Catalyzing net-zero carbon strategies: Enhancing CO2 flux Prediction from underground coal fires using optimized machine learning models, Journal of Cleaner Production, 441, (2024); Li, Jinliang, Thermodynamics of oxygen-containing intermediates and their role in coal spontaneous combustion, Energy, 260, (2022); Wang, Yongjun, Numerical study on calculation model of airflow temperature and humidity prediction in humid airway, Energy Science and Engineering, 11, 6, pp. 1985-1997, (2023); Bai, Zujing, Study on the mechanism of lignite oxidation inhibition by antioxidant resveratrol, Energy, 273, (2023); Onifade, Moshood, Countermeasures against coal spontaneous combustion: a review, International Journal of Coal Preparation and Utilization, 42, 10, pp. 2953-2975, (2022); Zhang, Yuanbo, Investigation of thermal behavior and hazards quantification in spontaneous combustion fires of coal and coal gangue, Science of the Total Environment, 843, (2022); Jie, Dingfei, The future of coal supply in China based on non-fossil energy development and carbon price strategies, Energy, 220, (2021); Ngo, Ichhuy, Enhancing fly ash utilization in backfill materials treated with CO2 carbonation under ambient conditions, International Journal of Mining Science and Technology, 33, 3, pp. 323-337, (2023); Ngo, Ichhuy, Sol–gel-stabilized CO2 foam for enhanced in-situ carbonation in foamed fly ash backfill materials, Geomechanics and Geophysics for Geo-Energy and Geo-Resources, 10, 1, (2024)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03605442; 18736785","0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808","ENEYD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203868168"

Using firm-level data from six Southeast Asian economies from 2012 to 2021, we find robust evidence that FITs substantially boosted firms' investment in RE. Moreover, the impact of FITs on RE investment in Southeast Asian economies varies across different RE technologies and firm characteristics. We find that the significant and positive impact of FITs on RE is largely driven by solar FITs on promoting investment in solar RE, but such effects are insignificant for other RE technologies including wind and biomass, geothermal, and hydro. Further, the impact of FITs on RE investments is more pronounced among younger and smaller firms than in older and larger firms. Our empirical evidence has implications for policy makers to design FITs in a cost-effective manner to promote more private sector investment in RE. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feed-in Tariff; Firm Level; Green Investment; Renewable Energy; Southeast Asia; Cost Effectiveness; Geothermal Energy; Energy Feed; Feed-in Tariff; Firm Level; Green Investment; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Investments; Renewable Energy Technologies; Smaller Firms; Southeast Asia; Southeast Asian Economies; Investments; Alternative Energy; Cost Analysis; Energy And Power Technology; Energy Policy; Firm Size; Industrial Investment; Private Sector; Solar Power","Cost effectiveness; Geothermal energy; Energy feed; Feed-in tariff; Firm level; Green investment; Renewable energies; Renewable energy investments; Renewable energy technologies; Smaller firms; Southeast Asia; Southeast Asian economies; Investments; alternative energy; cost analysis; energy and power technology; energy policy; firm size; industrial investment; private sector; solar power","","","","Asia in the Global Transition to Net Zero Asian Development Outlook 2023 Thematic Report, (2023); undefined, (2023); World Development Indicators 1999, (2005); Asean Energy in 2022 Outlook Report Asean Centre for Energy, (2022); Renewable Energy Outlook for Asean Towards A Regional Energy Transition, (2022); Asean Feed in Tariff Fit Mechanism Report Asean Centre for Energy, (2018); Zhang, Libo, The impact of feed-in tariff reduction and renewable portfolio standard on the development of distributed photovoltaic generation in China, Energy, 232, (2021); Boomsma, Trine Krogh, Renewable energy investments under different support schemes: A real options approach, European Journal of Operational Research, 220, 1, pp. 225-237, (2012); Liu, Cengceng, On the impact of FIT policies on renewable energy investment: Based on the solar power support policies in China's power market, Renewable Energy, 94, pp. 251-267, (2016); Polzin, Friedemann, How do policies mobilize private finance for renewable energy?—A systematic review with an investor perspective, Applied Energy, 236, pp. 1249-1268, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18729118; 03062619","","APEND","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200105165"

This study gives a comprehensive analysis of large-scale electrolyzer plants when providing frequency support to power systems. First, the authors present a model predictive control (MPC)-based secondary frequency controller, combined with a droop controller as the primary frequency controller and a virtual inertia controller. Additionally, the study introduces a universal system frequency response (U-SFR) modeling approach that enables high accuracy, low computation burden, and reduced initial parameters as a testbed. Finally, an in-depth analysis is conducted, focusing on different technical aspects of large-scale electrolyzer plants when providing frequency support services. Case studies integrating PEM and Alkaline electrolyzers into the modified IEEE 39-bus system with over 50% wind power penetration are conducted. It is found that the proposed U-SFR model achieves high accuracy with lower computational time compared to detailed physical models. Additionally, model predictive controllers improve frequency quality more effectively than PID and PID-FLC methods. PEM electrolyzers are found to be more efficient in providing grid frequency support than alkaline electrolyzers due to their technical characteristics. Finally, smaller hydrogen tanks may frequently breach storage constraints, negatively impacting the system's frequency response capability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline Electrolyzer; Frequency Regulation Ancillary Services; Hydrogen; Pem Electrolyzer; Wind Power; Bode Diagrams; Electrolytic Tanks; Frequency Stability; Invariance; Proportional Control Systems; Wind Power Integration; Alkaline Electrolyze; Alkalines; Ancillary Service; Electrolyzers; Frequency Regulation Ancillary Service; Frequency Regulations; Large-scales; Pem-electrolyzer; Power; System Frequency; Predictive Control Systems","Bode diagrams; Electrolytic tanks; Frequency stability; Invariance; Proportional control systems; Wind power integration; Alkaline electrolyze; Alkalines; Ancillary service; Electrolyzers; Frequency regulation ancillary service; Frequency regulations; Large-scales; PEM-electrolyzer; Power; System frequency; Predictive control systems","","","This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2023-PC-031.

Using a GIS-based Analytic Hierarchy Process with multi-criteria decision-making (AHP-MCDM), this research integrates stakeholders’ opinions, environmental considerations, and technical factors to assess land suitability for wind energy development. The analysis reveals that Jamaica has the potential to increase its wind power output by 8.99% compared to the current production of 99 MW. This expansion could significantly contribute to offsetting fossil fuel-based energy consumption and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It identifies sites across several parishes, including Westmoreland, Clarendon, St. Mary, and St. James, as highly suitable for utility-scale wind farm development.

However, the unpredictable and intermittent nature of available resources poses challenges for optimal MG scheduling. Hybrid AC–DC microgrids provide a solution, seamlessly integrating renewables while reducing energy losses and improving power grid reliability. Additionally, incentive-based demand response programs promote flexible energy consumption, further mitigating the variability of renewable generation and enhancing grid stability. This paper investigates the challenges and potential of high renewable penetration in hybrid AC–DC MGs, analysing the role of demand response programs in system optimization. The microgrid's energy management is modelled using MILP, while a Stackelberg game represents the demand response program.

Nonetheless, the most significant drawback of Photovoltaic is its intermittence, making it an obvious source of power fluctuation. This study proposes a novel scheme for real-time or intraday PV power forecasting by adopting two predictive models, namely, White-box and Combination. The White-box model is implemented employing mathematical calculations and statistics called Exceedance Probability. Meanwhile, the Combination model is an aggregation of several predictive models' outputs including the White-box model and benchmark ones by dynamically adjusting the weight coefficient of each model based on their forecasting accuracy. The experimental results, which are verified on two PV systems corresponding to two case studies located at Vietnam and Australia, indicate that the two proposed models outperform other referenced models as (Formula presented.) improves approximately 40% and 38% in terms of the first and second case study, respectively. In particular, the White-box model shows superiority by updating the forecast every 10 min, which can adapt to the fluctuation of weather conditions whereas the Combination one yields acceptable precision, indicating its flexible application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Forecasting Theory; Solar Photovoltaic Systems; Statistical Analysis; Adaptive Methods; Australia; Case-studies; Forecasting Theory; Power Forecasting; Predictive Models; Real- Time; Solar Photovoltaic System; Viet Nam; White-box Models; Prediction Models","Adaptive methods; Australia; Case-studies; Forecasting theory; Power forecasting; Predictive models; Real- time; Solar photovoltaic system; Viet Nam; White-box models; Prediction models","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under Project Number T2022\u2010PC\u2010001.","Renewables 2022, (2022); Limouni, Tariq, Accurate one step and multistep forecasting of very short-term PV power using LSTM-TCN model, Renewable Energy, 205, pp. 1010-1024, (2023); Ahmed, Razin, A review and evaluation of the state-of-the-art in PV solar power forecasting: Techniques and optimization, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 124, (2020); Böök, Herman, Site-specific adjustment of a NWP-based photovoltaic production forecast, Solar Energy, 211, pp. 779-788, (2020); Sharadga, Hussein, Time series forecasting of solar power generation for large-scale photovoltaic plants, Renewable Energy, 150, pp. 797-807, (2020); Yang, Dazhi, Operational photovoltaics power forecasting using seasonal time series ensemble, Solar Energy, 166, pp. 529-541, (2018); Gaboitaolelwe, Jwaone, Machine Learning Based Solar Photovoltaic Power Forecasting: A Review and Comparison, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 40820-40845, (2023); Nguyen, Duc Tuyen, Forecasting I-V characteristic of PV modules considering real operating conditions using numerical method and deep learning, pp. 544-549, (2020); Nguyen-Trong, Thanh, Short-term PV power forecast using hybrid deep learning model and Variational Mode Decomposition, Energy Reports, 9, pp. 712-717, (2023); Agga, Ali, Short-term self consumption PV plant power production forecasts based on hybrid CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM models, Renewable Energy, 177, pp. 101-112, (2021)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","17521424; 17521416","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204917778"

Circumventing scaling relations is an effective strategy to break through the bottleneck of natural seawater splitting. Herein, by DFT calculation, we demonstrated that the interface boundaries between Ni<inf>2</inf>P and MoO<inf>2</inf> play an essential role in the self-relaxation of the Ni–O interfacial bond, effectively modulating a coordination number of intermediates to control independently their adsorption-free energy, thus circumventing the adsorption-energy scaling relation. Following this conceptual model, a well-defined 3D F-doped Ni<inf>2</inf>P-MoO<inf>2</inf> heterostructure microrod array was rationally designed via an interfacial engineering strategy toward urea-assisted natural seawater electrolysis. As a result, the F-Ni<inf>2</inf>P-MoO<inf>2</inf> exhibits eminently active and durable bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER in acid, alkaline, and alkaline seawater-based electrolytes. By in-situ analysis, we found that a thin amorphous layer of NiOOH, which is evolved from the Ni<inf>2</inf>P during anodic reaction, is real catalytic active sites for the OER and UOR processes.

However, research on the impacts of ETS in Vietnam is still unclear, especially since there is no study on ETS revenue redistribution policies. By developing a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this paper simulates the potential impacts of the ETS with different revenue redistribution options. The results indicate that to achieve Vietnam's target of 15.8% carbon emission reduction, the carbon price would significantly affect the economy with a GDP drop of 3.7% and a welfare loss of 2.89% of GDP. The revenue redistribution policies would lighten these negative impacts. While transferring to government activities reduces GDP loss, reducing income tax policy results in welfare improvement. At the sectoral level, the electricity sector is most negatively affected and also plays a key role in reducing carbon emissions in Vietnam. The revenue redistribution for government activities could improve outputs for the construction and some heavy industries while the revenue redistribution policy for households creates improvements for light industries and the electricity industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cge; Economics; Environment; Ets; Redistribution Policy; Vietnam; Carbon Emission; Computable General Equilibrium Analysis; Emission Control; Emissions Trading; Environmental Economics; Gross Domestic Product; Viet Nam","carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; Viet Nam","","","","Adams, Philip David, An emissions trading scheme for Australia: National and regional impacts, Economic Record, 90, 290, pp. 316-344, (2014); Choi, Yongrok, The economy impacts of Korean ETS with an emphasis on sectoral coverage based on a CGE approach, Energy Policy, 109, pp. 835-844, (2017); Futures, (2015); Fiscal Policies for Paris Climate Strategiesfrom Principle to Practice Policy Paper no 19 136 Issue May, (2019); Jia, Zhijie, What kind of enterprises and residents bear more responsibilities in carbon trading?

Similarly, Co<inf>2</inf>CrGe, with a magnetic moment of 4.00 μB, transitions to a paramagnetic state at a higher temperature of 952 K, demonstrating enhanced thermal durability. Moreover, Cr<inf>2</inf>VGe, notable for its robust magnetic moment of 2.81 μB, retains its ferromagnetic characteristics until an exceptional 2412 K, making it extremely valuable for thermally intensive environments.

PVA-gel beads with 5 % magnetite and 0.5 % starch were optimal for physical strength and treatment performance. A pair of 2 L-up-flow anaerobic sludge blankets (UASB), one with the bead (UB) and another without (U) as a controller, operated continuously at 30 °C and an HRT of 11–24 h for 302 days. UB showed better performance than U in most phases, especially with influent dye of 200 mg·L−1, suggesting a greater tolerance to dye toxicity of UB than U. Microbial analysis revealed that the PVA/Fe/starch gel beads successfully captured the dye degrader Clostridium. Diversity indices indicated that PVA/Fe/Starch gel beads effectively support microbial diversity and resilience under varying dye concentrations.

Generally, pyrolysis is carried out in an inert atmosphere; however, reactive catalytic pyrolysis has emerged as an alternative technique for achieving high catalytic efficiency. Herein, NiCe/CN catalysts with different Ni:Ce ratios were developed, and their catalytic efficiency in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of palm kernel shells in a CO<inf>2</inf> atmosphere was evaluated. The effects of reaction conditions, including the reaction temperature (400–600 °C) and ratio of Ni:Ce (10:0, 10:1, 10:3, 10:5, and 10:10), on the product yields were studied using in situ and ex situ analyses. NiCe/CN50 exhibited enhanced oxygen removal efficiency owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies in CeO<inf>x</inf>. In addition, the acidic site of the catalyst promoted the highly selective demethoxylation of alkylphenols. The presence of Ce promoted the Boudouard reaction (C + CO<inf>2</inf> → 2CO), which reduced coke deposition on the spent catalyst. Our results indicate that the NiCe/CN50 catalyst exhibited good catalytic efficiency, achieving the highly selective production of alkylphenols and acetic acid and low deactivation. Therefore, NiCe/CN50 can be used as an alternative catalyst for phenol production from biomass via catalytic fast pyrolysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Co2 Utilization; N-doped Activated Carbon; Ni Catalyst; Pyrolysis; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysts; Cerium; Doping (additives); Efficiency; Palm Oil; Pyrolysis; Bio-oils; Catalytic Efficiencies; Co2 Utilization; Fast Pyrolysis; N-doped; N-doped Activated Carbon; Ni Catalysts; Palm Kernel Shells; Selective Production; ]+ Catalyst; Activated Carbon","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Cerium; Doping (additives); Efficiency; Palm oil; Pyrolysis; Bio-oils; Catalytic efficiencies; CO2 utilization; Fast pyrolysis; N-doped; N-doped activated carbon; Ni catalysts; Palm kernel shells; Selective production; ]+ catalyst; Activated carbon","","","This study was financially supported by the National Research Council of Thailand [contract no.

However, their practical capacity is limited, leading to low specific energy. Furthermore, the low electrical conductivity combined with a decline in capacity upon prolonged cycling (>1000 cycles) related to the loss of active material-carbon conducting contact regions contributes to moderate rate performance and cycling stability. The need for high specific energy cathodes that meet practical electrochemical requirements has prompted a search for new materials. Herein, we introduce a new carbon-coated Na<inf>3</inf>VFe<inf>0.5</inf>Ti<inf>0.5</inf>(PO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>3</inf> (NVFTP/C) material as a promising candidate in the NASICON family of cathodes for SIBs. With a high specific energy of ∼457 Wh kg−1 and a high Na+ insertion voltage of 3.0 V versus Na+/Na, this cathode can undergo a reversible single-phase solid-solution and two-phase (de)sodiation evolution at 28 C (1 C = 174.7 mAh g−1) for up to 10,000 cycles.

The bacterial monoculture could not utilize the pretreated bamboo, but the co-culture with P2 was successful.

One mechanism for promotion of economic development is government-driven policy. The problem is that it is not clear whether public-led economic promotion attracts consumers and which promotion factors are relatively significant for boosting particular goods. This paper examines attributes of green tea products likely influencing consumer preferences, focusing on the Thai Nguyen area in Vietnam as an example. In this area, the “One Commune, One Product” (OCOP) project has been implemented by the local government. This study employs randomized conjoint analysis based on data collected from 450 randomly selected consumers in several local supermarkets. Interestingly, the results show that online style sales have a negative preference for the purchase of green tea products, while transparency, such as the traceability of the product and product information, and reliability, such as certification, enhance the purchase of these products by consumers. However, this finding is not necessarily robust because our results indicate that approximately 90% of consumers tend to choose the default pair, which means that they do not actively prefer the product, possibly implying that this kind of public-led promotion is not yet broadly familiar to all people. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attributes For Preference; Causal Inference; Conjoint Analysis; Green Tea; Ocop; Thai Nguyen; Certification; Conjoint Analysis; Consumption Behavior; Economic Development; Local Government; Marketing; Perception; Public Attitude; Tea; Thai Nguyen; Viet Nam","certification; conjoint analysis; consumption behavior; economic development; local government; marketing; perception; public attitude; tea; Thai Nguyen; Viet Nam","","","","World Tea Production and Trade Current and Future Development 2015; Hong, Nguyen Bich, Improvement in irrigation water use efficiency: a strategy for climate change adaptation and sustainable development of Vietnamese tea production, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 19, 4, pp. 1247-1263, (2017); Munasinghe, Mohan, Economic, social and environmental impacts and overall sustainability of the tea sector in Sri Lanka, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 12, pp. 155-169, (2017); Deka, Nabajyoti, Organic cultivation and sustainable value chain development for tea smallholders: Findings from Assam, India, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 32, pp. 562-579, (2022); Hong, Nguyen Bich, Environmental efficiency and economic losses of Vietnamese tea production: Implications for cost savings and environmental protection, Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, 61, 2, pp. 383-390, (2016); Global Market Report Cocoa, (2019); Biggs, Eloise M., The tea landscape of Assam: Multi-stakeholder insights into sustainable livelihoods under a changing climate, Environmental Science and Policy, 82, pp. 9-18, (2018); Ganbold, Narangerel, An evaluation of subsidy policy impacts, transient and persistent technical efficiency: A case of Mongolia, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 7, pp. 9223-9242, (2022); Crops and Livestock Products, (2024); Nguyen-Thi-Lan, Huong, Crop farming and technical efficiency of tea production nexus: An analysis of environmental impacts, Journal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences, 22, 3, pp. 158-164, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195807782"

The research yields the following findings. First, we find that GHG emission intensity exerts a significantly negative impact on CFP measured by return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). This effect is consistently substantiated across different measurements of GHG emission intensity and CFP. Second, our analysis includes a series of stringent robustness assessments, all of which affirm the stability and resilience of our primary findings. Third, following the Paris Agreement, a decrease in GHG emission intensity correlates with a further rise in ROA and ROE. Additionally, we emphasize the pivotal role of industry-specific characteristics and regional variables in shaping the connection between GHG emission intensity and CFP. Our findings underscore that the influence of GHG intensity on a firm's financial performance is particularly pronounced within high-emission sectors in contrast to their low-emission counterparts. Furthermore, we show that the impacts of GHG emission intensity on CFP are primarily driven by firms operating in Southern Africa. Fourth, to recognize potential endogeneity concerns within the GHG emission-CFP relationship, we employ a two-stage least-squares regression (2SLS) approach. This method utilizes industry-level GHG emission intensity as the principal instrumental variable (IV), and in order to further mitigate endogeneity issues, we incorporate both lagged GHG intensity and the instrument proposed by Lewbel (2012) based on heteroskedasticity as additional IVs alongside the kinky least squares method by Kiviet (2020). The results derived from our 2SLS estimates consistently corroborate the negative effect of GHG emission intensity on CFP. Finally, our empirical findings carry significant implications for both corporations and policymakers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Africa; Emission Intensity; Environmental Performance; Financial Performance; Ghg Emissions; Paris Agreement; Environmental Management; Finance; Gas Emissions; Least Squares Approximations; Africa; Corporate Financial Performance; Emissions Intensity; Environmental Performance; Financial Performance; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Greenhouses Gas; Paris Agreement; Return On Assets; Return On Equity; Greenhouse Gases","Environmental management; Finance; Gas emissions; Least squares approximations; Africa; Corporate financial performance; Emissions intensity; Environmental performance; Financial performance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Paris agreement; Return on assets; Return on equity; Greenhouse gases","","","","Aboud, Ahmed, The impact of social, environmental and corporate governance disclosures on firm value: Evidence from Egypt, Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies, 8, 4, pp. 442-458, (2018); Adhikary, Anirban, Impact of buyer-supplier network complexity on firms’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: An empirical investigation, International Journal of Production Economics, 230, (2020); Ddml Double Debiased Machine Learning in Stata, (2023); Summary for Policymakers, (2018); Azhgaliyeva, Dina, Firm Investment in Renewable Energy: An Empirical Evidence from the People’s Republic of China, Energy Proceedings, 25, (2022); Investment in Renewable Energy Environmental Pollution and Covid 19 A Firm Level Empirical Evidence from Prc, (2023); Baiocchi, Giovanni, The Impact of social factors and consumer behavior on carbon dioxide emissions in the United Kingdom, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 14, 1, pp. 50-72, (2010); Blind, Knut, The influence of regulations on innovation: A quantitative assessment for OECD countries, Research Policy, 41, 2, pp. 391-400, (2012); Regulation and Its Reform, (1982); Busch, Timo, How hot is your bottom line? linking carbon and financial performance, Business and Society, 50, 2, pp. 233-265, (2011)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","23525509","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192242638"

Our findings are three-fold. First, provincial income clustering in Vietnam follows patterns of club convergence towards multiple equilibria. Seven convergence clubs encompassing 61 provinces are identified. Second, spatial autocorrelation encourages neighboring provinces to converge toward shared income equilibria. High-income clusters are observed in the Northern and Southern Key Economic Regions, while low-income clusters are concentrated in the mountainous areas of Northern Vietnam. Finally, both internal and external factors significantly affect the formation of convergence clubs. Vital internal factors include localities’ initial conditions of physical capital and structural change. Meanwhile, external factors refer to spatial externalities among neighboring provinces. We highlight spatial complementarity in physical capital accumulation and spatial competition in industrial intensification among neighboring provinces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Club Convergence; Income Clustering; O40; O47; R10; R11; Spatial Dependence; Spatial Externalities; Structural Changes; Vietnam","","","","","Aginta, Harry, Spatial dynamics of consumer price in Indonesia: convergence clubs and conditioning factors, Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science, 5, 2, pp. 427-451, (2021); Anselin, Luc E., Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA, Geographical Analysis, 27, 2, pp. 93-115, (1995); Bartkowska, Monika, Regional convergence clubs in Europe: Identification and conditioning factors, Economic Modelling, 29, 1, pp. 22-31, (2012); Bentzen, Jan, Regional income convergence in an emerging Asian economy: empirical evidence from Vietnam, Post-Communist Economies, 33, 1, pp. 64-78, (2021); Cutrini, Eleonora, Economic integration, structural change, and uneven development in the European Union, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 50, pp. 102-113, (2019); Le, Thi Thu Diem, Fiscal decentralization and income convergence: evidence from Vietnam, Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy, 29, 3, pp. 1513-1532, (2024); Revilla Diez, Javier, Vietnam 30 years after Doi Moi: Achievements and challenges, Zeitschrift fur Wirtschaftsgeographie, 60, 3, pp. 121-133, (2016); Du, Kerui, Econometric convergence test and club clustering using stata, Stata Journal, 17, 4, pp. 882-900, (2017); Spatial Econometrics from Cross Sectional Data to Spatial Panels, (2014); Esiyok, Bulent, A SPATIAL REGRESSION APPROACH to FDI in Vietnam: PROVINCE-LEVEL EVIDENCE, Singapore Economic Review, 62, 2, pp. 459-481, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","25097954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189915492"

Photovoltaic energy is influenced by weather conditions and cloud movement, constituting the primary factors contributing to stochastic characteristics and uncertainty in predictive accuracy. Consequently, recent studies have focused on developing forecasting methods that utilize weather factors or nearby farms as multi-variable inputs. This study introduces several challenges, and one of the most significant goals is to capture the correlation between data series (spatial feature) and temporal correlation within each series (temporal feature) simultaneously. However, most previous work has concentrated solely on the time or frequency domain. This work presents a novel approach based on the spectral and frequency domain, which efficiently captures spatial–temporal correlations via Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). In this manner, spatial correlations are clearly represented via the adjacency matrix of GFT, and temporal correlations are clarified via DFT. The study provides specific evidence concerning the interpretability and extraction efficiency of the adjacency matrix in the context of multi-variable, single-site, and multi-site data. Simultaneously, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the representation approach in the spectral domain. The results pointed out the forecasting method proposed has higher forecasting accuracy than the benchmark model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Neural Networks; Graph Signal Processing; Machine Learning; Photovoltaic (pv) Forecasting; Spectral Domain; Time Series Forecasting; Convolution; Forecasting; Frequency Domain Analysis; Graph Neural Networks; Machine Learning; Matrix Algebra; Signal Processing; Stochastic Systems; Strain Measurement; Wind Power; Graph Signal Processing; Machine-learning; Multi-site; Photovoltaic Forecasting; Photovoltaics; Signal-processing; Single Sites; Spectral Domains; Time Series Forecasting; Discrete Fourier Transforms","Convolution; Forecasting; Frequency domain analysis; Graph neural networks; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Signal processing; Stochastic systems; Strain measurement; Wind power; Graph signal processing; Machine-learning; Multi-site; Photovoltaic forecasting; Photovoltaics; Signal-processing; Single sites; Spectral domains; Time series forecasting; Discrete Fourier transforms","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-001 .","Forecasting Solar Power Generation Utilizing Machine Learning Models in Lubbock, (2023); Zheng, Lingwei, Historical PV-output characteristic extraction based weather-type classification strategy and its forecasting method for the day-ahead prediction of PV output, Energy, 271, (2023); Brester, Christina, Evaluating neural network models in site-specific solar PV forecasting using numerical weather prediction data and weather observations, Renewable Energy, 207, pp. 266-274, (2023); Mayer, Martin János, Comparing global and regional downscaled NWP models for irradiance and photovoltaic power forecasting: ECMWF versus AROME, Applied Energy, 352, (2023); Böök, Herman, Site-specific adjustment of a NWP-based photovoltaic production forecast, Solar Energy, 211, pp. 779-788, (2020); Ren, Xiaoying, Quad-kernel deep convolutional neural network for intra-hour photovoltaic power forecasting, Applied Energy, 323, (2022); Zang, Haixiang, Day-ahead photovoltaic power forecasting approach based on deep convolutional neural networks and meta learning, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 118, (2020); Zhen, Hao, Photovoltaic power forecasting based on GA improved Bi-LSTM in microgrid without meteorological information, Energy, 231, (2021); Gao, Mingming, Day-ahead power forecasting in a large-scale photovoltaic plant based on weather classification using LSTM, Energy, 187, (2019); Wang, Lining, Accurate solar PV power prediction interval method based on frequency-domain decomposition and LSTM model, Energy, 262, (2023)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524677","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188712695"

The segregation of these solute atoms into dislocation loops has attracted attention as a mechanism to accelerate solute clustering. In this study, the behaviors of solute Mn and Ni atoms in Fe-0.6wt.%Ni, Fe-1.4wt.%Mn, and Fe-1.4wt.%Mn-0.6wt.%Ni alloys irradiated at 400 °C up to 3 dpa were analyzed using three-dimensional atom probe tomography. Solute atom clusters were observed in all materials, and their shapes were spherical, flat, and torus in FeNi, FeMn, and FeMnNi, respectively. In ternary alloy FeMnNi, Mn and Ni atoms were concentrated in the sample in the form of arcs, and the orientation of the plane containing the arcs was estimated by comparing field desorption images. The size, number density, and orientation of this structure were found to be in good agreement with those of both types of dislocation loops, namely, b = 1/2 〈1 1 1〉 and b = 〈1 0 0〉, identified in a previous study using the same material. The positions of Ni and Mn enrichment did not fully overlap. Ni atoms tended to be concentrated more in the inner part of the loop than the Mn atoms. Mn atoms were enriched only in the vicinity of the dislocation loops, whereas Ni atoms showed a higher concentration inside the dislocation loops than in the bulk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atom Probe Tomography; Dislocation Loop; Reactor Pressure Vessel; Solute Cluster; Atoms; Binary Alloys; Manganese Alloys; Neutron Irradiation; Nickel Alloys; Pressure Vessels; Probes; Ternary Alloys; Atom-probe Tomography; Dislocation Loop; Fe-ions; Iron-based Alloy; Mn Atoms; Ni Atoms; Nickel Atoms; Reactor Pressure Vessel; Solute Atoms; Solute Cluster; Iron Alloys","Atoms; Binary alloys; Manganese alloys; Neutron irradiation; Nickel alloys; Pressure vessels; Probes; Ternary alloys; Atom-probe tomography; Dislocation loop; Fe-ions; Iron-based alloy; Mn atoms; Ni atoms; Nickel atoms; Reactor Pressure Vessel; Solute atoms; Solute cluster; Iron alloys","","","","Odette, George Robert, On the dominant mechanism of irradiation embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel steels, Scripta Metallurgica, 17, 10, pp. 1183-1188, (1983); Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, (1985); Odette, George Robert, Recent progress in understanding reactor pressure vessel steel embrittlement, Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids, 144, 1-4, pp. 189-231, (1998); Koyama, Toshiyuki, Computer simulation of phase decomposition in Fe-Cu-Mn-Ni quaternary alloy based on the phase-field method, Materials Transactions, 46, 6, pp. 1187-1192, (2005); Styman, Paul D., Precipitation in long term thermally aged high copper, high nickel model RPV steel welds, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 57, pp. 86-92, (2012); Murakami, Kenta, Influence of copper precipitates on clustering behavior of alloying elements observed in Japanese reactor pressure vessel surveillance materials using atom probe tomography, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 542, (2020); Wells, Peter B., Evolution of manganese-nickel-silicon-dominated phases in highly irradiated reactor pressure vessel steels, Acta Materialia, 80, pp. 205-219, (2014); Shu, Shipeng, Thermodynamics and kinetics of core-shell versus appendage co-precipitation morphologies: An example in the Fe-Cu-Mn-Ni-Si system, Acta Materialia, 157, pp. 298-306, (2018); Gupta, Kinkar Prasad, The Mn-Ni-Si (manganese-nickel-silicon) system, Journal of Phase Equilibria and Diffusion, 27, 5, pp. 529-534, (2006); Castin, Nicolas, The dominant mechanisms for the formation of solute-rich clusters in low-Cu steels under irradiation, Materials Today Energy, 17, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23521791","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188517052"

In the proposed method, both capacitance and dc-offset voltage of the decoupling capacitors are designed unbalanced with the bottom capacitor having a dominant effect over the top one, which reduces the decoupling capacitance requirements compared to the previous works. In addition, the effect of lower dc-link capacitance in reducing power rating of the precharge resistor, typically used in OBC applications, is presented. This effect, overlooked in previous literature, leads to reducing volume and cost of the OBC. A small signal model of the HSC-PD is introduced, and a modified feedback control strategy is proposed, offering lower memory usage and calculation effort for the digital signal processor (DSP) microcontroller when compared with conventional proportional resonant (PR) controllers. The comparisons of the proposed method with other HSC-PD counterparts as well as with the conventional E-cap method are given. Finally, a 7.4-kW prototype of an 820-V interleaved totem-pole power factor correction (PFC) with an HSC-PD is built and tested to verify the superior performance of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","800-v Electric Vehicles; Electrolytic Capacitor (e-cap); Half-bridge Split Capacitor; On-board Battery Charger (obc); Power Decoupling (pd); Capacitance; Controllers; Digital Control Systems; Electric Machine Control; Electric Power System Control; Electric Vehicles; Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors; Secondary Batteries; 800v Electric Vehicle; Battery; Capacitor Power; Electrolytic Capacitor;; Frequency Control; Half-bridge; Half-bridge Split Capacitor; Obc;; Power Decoupling; Power Decoupling;; Electrolytic Capacitors","Capacitance; Controllers; Digital control systems; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric vehicles; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; Secondary batteries; 800v electric vehicle; Battery; Capacitor power; Electrolytic capacitor;; Frequency control; Half-bridge; Half-bridge split capacitor; OBC;; Power decoupling; Power decoupling;; Electrolytic capacitors","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DN2022-20-04.","Barroso, Daniel Goretti L., Electrified Automotive Propulsion Systems: State-of-the-Art Review, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 8, 2, pp. 2898-2914, (2022); Park, Yongwan, DAB Converter for EV Onboard Chargers Using Bare-Die SiC MOSFETs and Leakage-Integrated Planar Transformer, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 8, 1, pp. 209-224, (2022); Yilmaz, Murat, Review of battery charger topologies, charging power levels, and infrastructure for plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 5, pp. 2151-2169, (2013); Global Ev Outlook 2022, (2022); Khaligh, Alireza, Global Trends in High-Power On-Board Chargers for Electric Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 68, 4, pp. 3306-3324, (2019); Oh, Chang-yeol, A high-efficient nonisolated single-stage on-board battery charger for electric vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 12, pp. 5746-5757, (2013); Li, Bin, Bi-directional on-board charger architecture and control for achieving ultra-high efficiency with wide battery voltage range, Conference Proceedings - IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC, pp. 3688-3694, (2017); Zhang, Zhengda, High-Efficiency High-Power-Density CLLC Resonant Converter with Low-Stray-Capacitance and Well-Heat-Dissipated Planar Transformer for EV On-Board Charger, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 35, 10, pp. 10831-10851, (2020); Lu, Jiangheng, Dynamic Strategy for Efficiency Estimation in a CCM-Operated Front-End PFC Converter for Electric Vehicle Onboard Charger, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 3, 3, pp. 545-553, (2017); Musavi, Fariborz, Evaluation and efficiency comparison of front end AC-DC plug-in hybrid charger topologies, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 1, pp. 413-421, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23327782","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166782732"

Moreover, Vietnam ranks as one of the top five countries most severely affected by climate change, with 1/3 of residents facing flood risks. This study presents a model to identify flood susceptibility using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in the GIS environment for Hanoi, Vietnam. Nine flood-conditioning factors were selected and used as initial data. The AHP analysis was utilized to determine the priority levels of these factors concerning flood susceptibility and to assess the consistency of the obtained results to develop a flood-susceptibility map. The performance of the model was found to be significant based on the AUC value for the obtained receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The flood-susceptibility map has five levels of flood susceptibility: the area with a very high susceptibility to flooding accounts for less than 1% of the map, high- susceptibility areas for nearly 11%, moderate-susceptibility areas for more than 65%, low- susceptibility areas for about 22%, and very low-susceptibility areas for 2%.

However, it has been hypothesized that the FQ’s adsorption capability is strongly influenced by the pyrolysis temperature at which the CCBC is formed. Different pyrolysis temperatures (600 °C, 700 °C, 900 °C) and residence times (1 h and 2 h) were examined to characterize the CCBC’s adsorption property. For the first time, Bayesian non-linear regression based on the Langmuir adsorption model was applied to accurately estimate the adsorption capacity of the FQs ciprofloxacin (CFX) and delafloxacin (DFX). The results showed that the biochar produced at 900 °C in 2 h of pyrolysis had the best iodine adsorption capacity, with the estimated maximum surface area CCBC of 2918 m2 g−1. The CFX and DFX adsorption capacity were similarly at their highest with biochar generated at 900 °C and 2 h of pyrolysis. However, the adsorption of CFX was greater than DFX and this was estimated by the micropore structure of CCBC. Infrared spectra (FTIR) detected the carboxyl group and ester group which could be explained by the high value of K<inf>L</inf> in the Langmuir model. The results have shown the capability of the Corn cob biochar in removing FQs from the environment and it is a cost-effective material that can be developed for other emerging contaminants as well. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption Isotherm; Bayesian; Corncob Biochar; Delafloxacin; Fluoroquinolones; Adsorption; Antibiotics; Cost Effectiveness; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Adsorption Capacities; Bayesian; Biochar; Condition; Corn Cob; Corncob Biochar; Delafloxacin; Fluoroquinolones; Pyrolysis Temperature; S Adsorptions; Pyrolysis","Adsorption; Antibiotics; Cost effectiveness; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Adsorption capacities; Bayesian; Biochar; Condition; Corn cob; Corncob biochar; Delafloxacin; Fluoroquinolones; Pyrolysis temperature; S adsorptions; Pyrolysis","","","","Ohoro, Chinemerem Ruth, Distribution and chemical analysis of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environmental systems: A review, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 17, (2019); Manaia, Celia, Antibiotic resistance in urban aquatic environments: can it be controlled?, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 100, 4, pp. 1543-1557, (2016); Liu, Yurong, In situ SAXS studies of the pore development in biochar during gasification, Carbon, 172, pp. 454-462, (2021); Chowdhury, Arif, Activated carbon loaded with Ni-Co-S nanoparticle for superior adsorption capacity of antibiotics and dye from wastewater: Kinetics and isotherms, Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects, 611, (2021); Gracia-Lor, Emma, Occurrence and removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants at the Spanish Mediterranean area of Valencia, Chemosphere, 87, 5, pp. 453-462, (2012); Cherniak, Samuel L., Conventional and biological treatment for the removal of microplastics from drinking water, Chemosphere, 288, (2022); Chan, Sooksin, Recent advances biodegradation and biosorption of organic compounds from wastewater: Microalgae-bacteria consortium - A review, Bioresource Technology, 344, (2022); Trawiński, Jakub, Comparative analysis of in vivo and in silico toxicity evaluation of the organoiodine compounds towards D. magna using multivariate chemometric approach: A study on the example of amiodarone phototransformation products, Chemosphere, 292, (2022); Albolafio, Sofía, Strategies for mitigating chlorinated disinfection byproducts in wastewater treatment plants, Chemosphere, 288, (2022); Walpen, Nicolas, Application of UV absorbance and electron-donating capacity as surrogates for micropollutant abatement during full-scale ozonation of secondary-treated wastewater, Water Research, 209, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21906823; 21906815","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136482649"

This study introduces an innovative approach by integrating the production of syngas and CO<inf>2</inf> adsorbent during the gasification process of rice straw, departing from the conventional focus solely on improving gasification efficiency. Results showed that the gasification of rice straw, conducted in the 20 kWe commercial gasification system (PP20 All Power Lab), attained a thermal conversion efficiency of 58.7%. Syngas produced exhibited consistent composition, with CO and H<inf>2</inf> content ranging from 12.1% to 15%, CO ranging from 16.9% to 22.1%, and CH<inf>4</inf> ranging from 1.9% to 3.9% throughout the operation, demonstrating relative stability. Notably, a considerable amount of residual char, accounting for 22.1 wt% of the initial feedstock, was generated. Characterized by notable traits such as high surface basicity, aromaticity, and a dense concentration of (ultra-)micropores, the residual char demonstrates suitability for applications in CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption. In controlled laboratory conditions (25 °C, 1 atm, without heat-mass transfer limitations), the adsorption capacity reached 1.2 mmol g−1. Transitioning to more practical conditions (40 °C, 1 atm, within a 2-cm adsorbent bed subject to diffusion constraints), the CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption capacity of the residual char ranged between 2% and 4.8% of the adsorbent's weight, while the CO<inf>2</inf>/N<inf>2</inf> selectivity measured between 25.5 and 29.7.

With the direct coupled system, the power loss and external price on auxiliary devices are avoided. However, the adaptability of the direct coupled system to fluctuate solar irradiance and ambient temperature is reduced significantly compared to systems with DC-DC converters. To maximise the system efficiency, the optimal electrolyser (ELY) cell configuration is identified using an optimal sizing approach or operating strategy. This paper applied the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to find the optimal configuration for the two approaches, namely the Sizing technique and Operating strategy under different PV systems: faults, degradation and partial shading conditions. Additionally, a large-scale system is simulated to describe the characteristics of a large-scale direct coupled PV-electrolyser system with actual operating faults and phenomena. Simulations of the large-scale direct coupling system were conducted using measured irradiance and temperature data for a typical day period. Based on the collected output, it is found that compared to the optimal sizing approach, the optimal operating strategy allows the direct coupled system to increase its coupling efficiency from 0.17% to 4.47%. In contrast, the amount of hydrogen production when applying the two methods witnessed different trends, depending on the type of faults. The differences are even more significantly presented during multiple short-circuit fault scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Direct Coupling; Electrolyser; Hydrogen; Partial Shading; Pv Faults","","","","The authors of this article want to express their gratitude to the individuals from the 100% Renewable Energy Lab at Hanoi University of Science and Technology for their support during the article's drafting phase.

Here, the phase separation and water channels of poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSSA)-grafted poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene) (ETFE) polymer electrolyte membranes (ETFE-PEMs) are characterized by a newly applying method based on electron density fluctuation, F, in the small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles. The ETFE-PEMs exhibit an increase in phase separation in the ion exchange capacity of 0–0.7 mmol/g as qualitatively determined by the increase in the SAXS invariant. The increase in the SAXS invariant is attributed to the evolution of the newly separated phase between the surfaces of crystalline ETFE backbones and the side chains of PSSA grafts. This phase separation allows the formation of water channels upon low relative humidity (RH). The ionic-domain spacing is around 1.52 nm at dry condition and then increases to 1.69 nm at low RH of 10%, reflecting the ion-water aggregation to make larger aggregate size. At 30% relative humidity, the highly ordered lamellar proton-conducting nanochannels (water channels) are formed in the membrane, which correspond to the dramatic increase in proton conductivity. It is interesting to note that these conducting nanochannels remain unchanged upon 30–70% RH. Also, in this range of RH the similar signatures in the pair distribution function suggests that the molecular packing and local structures are highly similar. Above features of phase separation and water channels can elucidate important characteristics of the ETFE-PEMs, especially the high proton conductivity at low RH. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Phase Separation; Polymer Electrolyte Membrane; Radiation Grafting; Water Channel","","","","This work was funded by Vingroup Big Data Institute (VINBIGDATA) , Vingroup and supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under project code VINIF .2020.DA08.","Shahbaz, Ahmad, An overview of proton exchange membranes for fuel cells: Materials and manufacturing, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 47, 44, pp. 19086-19131, (2022); Aminudin, Muhammad Akmal, An overview: Current progress on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 48, 11, pp. 4371-4388, (2023); Pramuanjaroenkij, Anchasa, The fuel cell electric vehicles: The highlight review, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 48, 25, pp. 9401-9425, (2023); Okonkwo, Paul C., Nafion degradation mechanisms in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system: A review, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 46, 55, pp. 27956-27973, (2021); Karimi, Mohammad Bagher, Recent approaches to improve Nafion performance for fuel cell applications: A review, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 44, 54, pp. 28919-28938, (2019); Nasef, Mohamed Mahmoud, Radiation-grafted membranes for polymer electrolyte fuel cells: Current trends and future directions, Chemical Reviews, 114, 24, pp. 12278-12329, (2014); Gubler, Lorenz, Polymer design strategies for radiation-grafted fuel cell membranes, Advanced Energy Materials, 4, 3, (2014); Golubenko, D.

Fish communities are ecologically important components of coastal ecosystems and are affected by multiple environmental factors. Despite their importance, determining the effects of environmental factors on seasonal variations in fish species diversity and community dynamics remains a challenge. The advent of environmental DNA (eDNA) technology, an environmentally conscious approach, has resulted in considerable advancements in recent years and has been progressively adopted for marine fish population monitoring. Here, we used environmental DNA metabarcoding to study seasonal variations in fish community structure on a coastal island, and we assessed the effects of environmental factors in structuring these communities. Our findings revealed a rich diversity of 72 fish species across 40 families and 23 orders in the seawater surrounding an island of the Seto Inland Sea (SIS), Western Japan. Notably, the composition of fish communities varied significantly between seasons, with seawater temperature, salinity, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentration identified as important factors correlated with fish communities’ structures. In conclusion, our study provides useful information of fish diversity, and we suggest that eDNA is a valuable technique for monitoring fish diversity in coastal areas.

The GCMS analysis identified various products from the oxidative conversion including phenol derivatives (Butylated hydroxytoluene, 1,2-Benzenediol, etc.), phenolic aldehydes (Vanillin, Syringaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, etc.), and carboxylic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid etc.). At a reaction temperature of 180 °C with a 2 h reaction time, Co/Zeolite HY catalyst yielded 9.81% and Cu/Zeolite HY catalyst yielded 13.53% for phenol derivatives. The optimal yield of lignin-derived compounds was achieved with a 5 wt% catalyst loading in the context of biomass weight, particularly with a 10% metal loading of Co and Cu over Zeolite HY support. Additionally, the total yield of lignin-derived compounds obtained was 32.85% for 10%Co/Zeolite HY and 23.89% for 10%Cu/Zeolite HY, catalysts respectively.

FeNi nanoparticles were obtained by a single-potentiostatic-step from the mixture of Fe(III) and Ni(II) ions dissolved in the deep eutectic solvent. The experimental evidence for the formation of the alloy nanoparticles was verified by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (element mapping), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These permalloy nanoparticles have shown outstanding magnetic properties, which are better than those of their individual components (Fe and Ni) obtained in the same eutectic solvent. The enhancement in magnetic properties of the obtained alloy was explained by theoretical studies using molecular dynamic simulations and hysteresis modeling. The origin of this enhancement is due to the presence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, which shows the minimum value along the ([001]) magnetic easy direction in the permalloy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Binary Alloys; Chlorine Compounds; Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy; Eutectics; Iron Compounds; Magnetic Properties; Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy; Molecular Dynamics; Nanomagnetics; Nickel Alloys; Nickel Compounds; Nucleation; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Solvents; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Choline Chloride; Deep Eutectic Solvents; Diffusion Controlled Growth; Electrochemical Characterizations; Electrochemical Nucleation; Fe-ni Nanoparticles; Kinetic Behavior; Permalloy Nanoparticles; Potentiostatics; Solvent Based; Iron Alloys","Binary alloys; Chlorine compounds; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Eutectics; Iron compounds; Magnetic properties; Magnetocrystalline anisotropy; Molecular dynamics; Nanomagnetics; Nickel alloys; Nickel compounds; Nucleation; Scanning electron microscopy; Solvents; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Choline chloride; Deep eutectic solvents; Diffusion controlled growth; Electrochemical characterizations; Electrochemical nucleation; Fe-ni nanoparticles; Kinetic behavior; Permalloy nanoparticles; Potentiostatics; Solvent based; Iron alloys","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.02-2019.28.

In the proposed control strategy, low-pass filters are integrated into each virtual control input, and a powerful backstepping controller with integrated tracking error action is utilized. An integral backstepping control (IBSP) integrator is added to improve the system’s robustness to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The low pass filter of dynamic surface control (DSC) based on an integral backstepping algorithm is adopted, from which the proposed control strategy improves steady-state accuracy and eliminates the derivative explosion phenomenon. Furthermore, non-linear lumped disturbance observers (NLDO) are used for axial displacement and rotation speed control loop to improve system stability by minimizing the impact of disturbances such as parameter uncertainties, unknown load torque and force, and unmodeled dynamics acting on the control system. Finally, the effectiveness, feasibility, and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation evaluation.

Multimetallic MOFs have emerged as excellent materials for several applications; however, it remains a significant challenge to synthesize and characterize these materials. In this work, we report a facile approach to synthesizing a series of multimetallic MOF nanosheet-assembled hierarchical flower-like morphologies as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for natural seawater electrolysis. Simultaneously, their three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures and multimetallic components can provide abundant active sites, improve intrinsic catalytic activity, and facilitate electron transfer. Consequently, the obtained RhCoNi-MOF exhibits overpotentials as low as 40, 48, and 50 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline freshwater, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater. In natural seawater, the RhCoNi-MOF also offers an outstanding performance comparable to Pt/C. Impressively, a two-electrode overall seawater electrolysis device using RhCoNi-MOF as a bifunctional catalyst requires a voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm-2 and can stably maintain over 80 h. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the superior electrocatalytic activity of the RhCoNi-MOF can be attributed to the synergistic effects of introducing Co and Rh metal ions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dft Calculation; Hydrogen Evolution Reaction; Multimetallic Mofs; Overall Seawater Splitting; Seawater Electrolysis; Alkalinity; Catalyst Activity; Chemical Modification; Density Functional Theory; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Metal Ions; Nanosheets; Organometallics; Seawater; Alkalines; Dft Calculation; Hydrogen Evolution Reactions; Industrial Scale; Metallics; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Multimetallic Mof; Overall Seawater Splitting; Seawater Electrolysis; Splittings; Electrocatalysts","Alkalinity; Catalyst activity; Chemical modification; Density functional theory; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Metal ions; Nanosheets; Organometallics; Seawater; Alkalines; DFT calculation; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Industrial scale; Metallics; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Multimetallic MOF; Overall seawater splitting; Seawater electrolysis; Splittings; Electrocatalysts","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM), under grant number A2023-50-01.

When considering wind turbine-based power facilities, the ability of these systems to stay connected to the grid throughout a fault or prolonged voltage drop is known as Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT). This paper suggests an approach to improve this capability, focusing on Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (PMSG) wind turbines based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller. The Model Predictive Control unit will enhance the turbine's response using a predictive algorithm, which feeds the predicted signals into a cost function that brings them into compliance with the desired reference value. By using an iterative loop to investigate the switching states of the Grid-Side Converter (GSC), the proposed controller assists the grid-side converter in providing the best switching signal to accelerate voltage recovery on the DC-link voltage, provide additional reactive power as well as ensure good output power quality to support the grid. The results of the method have been verified through Simulink/Matlab simulation software. The benefits of the proposed approach are better wind turbine responsiveness during the start and end of the fault, and successful LVRT management utilizing the modified grid-side converter. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lvrt; Mpc; Pmsg; Wind Turbine; Electric Motor Generator Sets; Matlab; Predictive Control Systems; Speed Regulators; Synchronous Generators; Wind Turbine Generators; Windmill; Grid Reliability; Grid Stability; Intermittent Renewables; Large-scales; Lower Voltage Ride Through; Model-predictive Control; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator; Power; Renewable Energy Source; Ridethrough Capability; Model Predictive Control","Electric motor generator sets; MATLAB; Predictive control systems; Speed regulators; Synchronous generators; Wind Turbine Generators; Windmill; Grid reliability; Grid stability; Intermittent renewables; Large-scales; Lower Voltage Ride Through; Model-predictive control; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Power; Renewable energy source; Ridethrough capability; Model predictive control","","","","Ahmed, Shakir D., Grid Integration Challenges of Wind Energy: A Review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 10857-10878, (2020); Global Wind Report 2023, (2023); Nasiri, Mojtaba, A review of low-voltage ride-through enhancement methods for permanent magnet synchronous generator based wind turbines, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 47, pp. 399-415, (2015); Proc of the International Conference on Electrical Machines ICEM, (2006); Wu, Yuankang, Design of a Large Commercial PMSG-based Wind Generator, pp. 5-8, (2019); Liserre, Marco, Overview of multi-MW wind turbines and wind parks, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 58, 4, pp. 1081-1095, (2011); García, Carlos E., Model predictive control: Theory and practice-A survey, Automatica, 25, 3, pp. 335-348, (1989); Predictive Control with Constraints, (2002); Taher, Seyed Abbas, Improving Fault Ride Through Capability of Full-Scale WRSG Wind Turbines Using MPC-Based DVR, pp. 863-867, (2019); Huchel, Łukasz, A Parallel Capacitor Control Strategy for Enhanced FRT Capability of DFIG, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 6, 2, pp. 303-312, (2015)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES); University of Kurdistan","11th International Conference on Power and Energy Systems Engineering, CPESE 2024","","Nara City","206243","","9798350377439","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217827484"

This paper proposes a new strategy to achieve voltage regulation in distributed power systems in the presence of solar sources and BESSs. The goal is to find the minimum size of the BESSs and their corresponding position in the network based on the size and location of the integrated solar generation. The proposed method formulates the problem by combining grid sensitivity coefficient analysis and modeling second-order cone programming (SOCP) in power flow analysis. Using reactive power to adjust voltage regulation is not always the optimal solution in distribution systems in which R/X is large. Therefore, the study only considers the minimum size and best BESS location achieved by optimizing the amount of solar-curtailed active power through BESS based on the grid topology and R/X ratios in the distribution system.

Many experts see microgrids as pivotal players in this shift. Microgrids offer enhanced reliability and resilience, along with cleaner energy. They are designed to operate in conjunction with distributed energy resources such as solar panels, fuel cells, and battery storage. These DERs are often more dependable and environmentally friendly compared to traditional energy sources. Among available energy storage systems, hydrogen emerges as a suitable solution due to its high power density and potential for bidirectional energy flow. It helps to enhance the electrical grid by employing gas-to-power solutions through fuel cells and storing excess electrical energy via power-to-gas electrolyzers. This paper introduces an islanded microgrid model comprising a controllable fuel cell system connected to an AC load through power electronic devices. The system undergoes operation under varying load conditions to assess the performance of fuel cells as grid-forming units and the microgrid's stability under the designed control structure. The results demonstrate that the proposed fuelcell system can operate autonomously without reliance on the main grid, in various conditions, from no-load to short-term overload. Moreover, they also verified the system performance of the proposed system under unbalanced load scenario. Overall, the results proved that the designed PEMFC distributed generator can remain stable under various working condition and temporary electrical faults. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Grid-forming; Hydrogen Storage System; Islanded Microgrid; Overloading; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (pemfc); Asynchronous Generators; Battery Storage; Clean Energy; Distributed Energy; Distributed Power Generation; High Energy Forming; Metal Castings; Microgrids; Renewable Energy; Uninterruptible Power Systems; Condition; Fuel Cell System; Grid-forming; Hydrogen Storage System; Hydrogen System; Islanded Microgrid; Microgrid; Overloading; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell; Proton-exchange Membranes Fuel Cells; Hydrogen Storage","Asynchronous generators; Battery storage; Clean energy; Distributed energy; Distributed power generation; High energy forming; Metal castings; Microgrids; Renewable energy; Uninterruptible power systems; Condition; Fuel cell system; Grid-forming; Hydrogen storage system; Hydrogen system; Islanded microgrid; Microgrid; Overloading; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell; Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells; Hydrogen storage","","","This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2023-PC-031.","Nguyen, Khai Manh, A comprehensive technical analysis on optimal sizing and operating strategy for large-scale direct coupled PV–electrolyser systems, considering PV system faults, degradation and partial shading conditions, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 59, pp. 492-506, (2024); Tayab, Usman Bashir, A review of droop control techniques for microgrid, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 76, pp. 717-727, (2017); Phan-Van, Long, A comprehensive review of direct coupled photovoltaic-electrolyser system: Sizing techniques, operating strategies, research progress, current challenges, and future recommendations, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 48, 65, pp. 25231-25249, (2023); Zhong, Qingchang, Current-Limiting Droop Control of Grid-Connected Inverters, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 64, 7, pp. 5963-5973, (2017); Heylen, Evelyn, Challenges and opportunities of inertia estimation and forecasting in low-inertia power systems, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 147, (2021); Alam, Mohammad Aslam, Comparative Analysis of TPS and EPS of IBDC for Power Management, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 723 LNEE, pp. 627-637, (2021); Phan-Van, Long, Review of hydrogen technologies based microgrid: Energy management systems, challenges and future recommendations, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 48, 38, pp. 14127-14148, (2023); Phan-Van, Long, An improved state machine-based energy management strategy for renewable energy microgrid with hydrogen storage system, Energy Reports, 9, pp. 194-201, (2023); Phan-Van, Long, A comparison of different metaheuristic optimization algorithms on hydrogen storage-based microgrid sizing, Energy Reports, 9, pp. 542-549, (2023); Sabir, Adeel, A novel low-voltage ride-through capable energy management scheme for a grid-connected hybrid photovoltaic-fuel cell power source, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 29, 2, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES); University of Kurdistan","11th International Conference on Power and Energy Systems Engineering, CPESE 2024","","Nara City","206243","","9798350377439","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217803048"

As DC-powered appliances like refrigerators and LED lighting become more common, transformer-based AC/DC converters, which avoid switching noise and reduce costs, are a promising solution. However, conventional 6-phase transformers used in these systems produce large DC voltage ripple and input current harmonics after rectification, often requiring polyphasing to mitigate these issues. This approach can increase transformer size and cost due to additional secondary windings. To address this, the authors propose a transformer with a special winding structure that minimizes secondary-side wiring complexity in multiphasing configurations. This study investigates the application of these transformers for AC/AC and hybrid AC/DC-AC/AC conversions, demonstrating improved conversion efficiency, reduced ripple, and enhanced power stability.

Unfortunately, existing RISC-V designs for lightweight cryptography still suffer from low performance and hardware efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a RISC-V architecture, referred to as LI-RV, to handle various lightweight algorithms with enhanced performance and hardware efficiency. Particularly, LI-RV applies two key optimal ideas to achieve these goals, including dual ALUs and multi-level custom function units. Notably, LI-RV is the first RISC-V architecture utilizing dual concatenable 32-bit ALUs to perform two 32-bit parallel calculations or combine them to perform one 64bit calculation. Real-time performance evaluation on the ZCU102 FPGA shows that LI-RV provides a 1.7-3.0 times improvement in processing speed and a 1.6-2.5 times improvement in the power-delay product compared to the software implementation. Compared with related RISC-V designs, LI-RV outperforms them by 1.2-7.9 times in throughput. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fpga; Lightweight Cryptography; Risc-v; Soc; Cryptography; Parallel Architectures; System-on-chip; Co-processors; Hardware Development; Hardware Efficiency; High Speed; High-low; Light-weight Cryptography; Low-power Consumption; Lower-power Consumption; Performance Efficiency; Risc-v; Coprocessor","Cryptography; Parallel architectures; System-on-chip; Co-processors; Hardware development; Hardware efficiency; High Speed; High-low; Light-weight cryptography; Low-power consumption; Lower-power consumption; Performance efficiency; RISC-V; Coprocessor","","","This work was supported by JST-ALCA-Next Program Grant Number JPMJAN23F5, Japan.

The AFE had a broad bandwidth, low noise, adjustable gain, high input impedance, could handle a variety of sensor inputs, and convert them to digital signal for biomedical recording systems. This design was developed based on the following blocks. The Buffer or Burrent-to-Voltage converter block (BCV), which could be set to operate as a buffer or a current-to-voltage converter circuit, achieved high input impedance and work with sensor signal types. A chopper capacitively-coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) was as the main amplifier stage of the AFE to reduce input-referred noise and balance the impedance of the overall AFE system. A programmable gain amplifier (PGA) allowed the overall gain of the AFE to be adjusted. A Successive Approximation Register Analog-to-Digital Converter (SAR ADC) with Single-Ended algorithm structure permited the conversion of biomedical signals after preprocessing into a high-resolution digital sequence. The suggested AFE operated in a wide frequency range of 0.5 Hz to 2 kHz with a high input impedance bigger than 2TΩ. With the lowest 100-dB CMRR and low input-referred noise of 1.8 μVrms, the AFE can achieve low noise efficiency. Moreover, the SAR ADC had an rail-to-rail input range and an output resolution of 12-bit with a maximum sampling rate of 2.5-MS/s. The ADC achieved SNDR of 57.32dB, SFDR of 62.05dB, helping to ensure that the biomedical signal after converting to digital signal with high quality. The design incorporated new features such as the BCV, the IRN, the CMRR and the ADC to achieve the diverse functions of converting in comparison to prior research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","180nm Cmos Process; Adc; Analog Front-end; Biomedical Signal Acquisition; Configurable Gain; High Input Impedance; Low Noise; Multi-channel System; Breath Controlled Devices; Buffer Amplifiers; Buffer Circuits; Chopper Amplifiers; Choppers (circuits); Dc-dc Converters; Direct Coupled Amplifiers; Electric Inverters; Eye Controlled Devices; Frequency Converter Circuits; Integrated Circuit Design; Low Noise Amplifiers; Negative Resistance; System-on-chip; Variable Gain Amplifiers; 180nm Cmos Process; Adc; Analog Front End; Biomedical Signal; Biomedical Signal Acquisition; Configurable Gain; High Input Impedance; Lower Noise; Multichannel System; Successive Approximation Register Analog-to-digital Converter; Cmos Integrated Circuits","Breath controlled devices; Buffer amplifiers; Buffer circuits; Chopper amplifiers; Choppers (circuits); DC-DC converters; Direct coupled amplifiers; Electric inverters; Eye controlled devices; Frequency converter circuits; Integrated circuit design; Low noise amplifiers; Negative resistance; System-on-chip; Variable gain amplifiers; 180nm CMOS process; ADC; Analog front end; Biomedical signal; Biomedical signal acquisition; Configurable gain; High input impedance; Lower noise; Multichannel system; Successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter; CMOS integrated circuits","","","","Journal of the Institute of Industrial Applications Engineers, (2022); Javaid, Mohd, Significance of sensors for industry 4.0: Roles, capabilities, and applications, Sensors International, 2, (2021); Tǎutan, Alexandra Maria, Signal quality in dry electrode EEG and the relation to skin-electrode contact impedance magnitude, pp. 12-22, (2014); Huynh, Hai Au, A 53GΩ@DC Input Impedance Multi-Channel Neural Recording Amplifier with 0.77 μvrms Input-Referred Noise for Deep Brain Implants, Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2021-April, (2021); Zheng, Jiawei, Chopper Capacitively Coupled Instrumentation Amplifier Capable of Handling Large Electrode Offset for Biopotential Recordings, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, 64, 12, pp. 1392-1396, (2017); Simoen, Eddy Roger, On the flicker noise in submicron silicon MOSFETs, Solid-State Electronics, 43, 5, pp. 865-882, (1999); Song, Haryong, Fully integrated biopotential acquisition analog front-end IC, Sensors, 15, 10, pp. 25139-25156, (2015); Wu, Chungyu, An 8-channel chopper-stabilized analog front-end amplifier for EEG acquisition in 65-nm CMOS, (2016); Programmable Gain Amplifier with Amplifier Common Mode Sampling System, (2014); Liu, Chuncheng, A 10-bit 50-MS/s SAR ADC with a monotonic capacitor switching procedure, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 45, 4, pp. 731-740, (2010)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2024 IEEE Region 10 Symposium, TENSYMP 2024","","New Delhi; WelcomHotel Dwarka","204286","","9798350364866","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211950627"

The conventional submerged paddy ecosystems not only consume water excessively but also constitute a major source of methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf> O), two highly potent greenhouse gases (GHG). The main objective of this study is to investigate the alternate wetting and draining (AWD) method as an emerging water-saving strategy for Asian countries, which could potentially minimise GHG emissions while maintaining crop productivity. Seasonal CH<inf>4</inf> and N<inf>2</inf> O emissions from Sri Lankan and Indian experimental sites under the AWD method were compared with emissions from the conventional completely flooded (CF) method, while Japanese experimental sites were used to examine. CH<inf>4</inf> ebullition under CF conditions. Emission measurements were conducted in both wet and dry seasons with no alterations to country-specific applications of fertiliser and soil amendments. Overall results revealed that AWD could potentially suppress CH<inf>4</inf> emissions by 32 to 43% without a significant statistical contrast (p > 0.05) in the crop yield. Measurements in Japan revealed that ebullition accounted for 60% of the total methane emissions at the heading stage under CF conditions.

Relative humidity (RH) cycling tests using hydrogen gas and air were conducted on a PEMFC embedded membrane NRE211 at the current density of 0 (i.e. open circuit voltage (OCV)), 0.05, and 0.3 Acm−2. After every 200 RH cycles, catalytic combustion was analyzed during OCV measurement using the thermal imaging method, employing a high-transmittance glass on the cathode side. Hotspots created due to combustion were successfully captured, with a maximum temperature rise of approximately 16 °C compared to the operating temperature of 80 °C. The heat transfer model predicts the GDL’s temperature rise fairly well and indicates that the combustion heat is predominantly transferred to the hydrogen stream due to the high convective heat transfer coefficient. During OCV measurements, the membrane temperature is increased but remains well below its auto-ignition temperature of 300 °C. However, the formation of pinholes in the scanning electron microscope images at the current density of 0 Acm−2 revealed the instant occurrence of accidental combustion during the RH cycling test when the infrared camera was not employed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Combustion; Pemfc; Thermal Imaging Method; Density Of Gases; Gas Permeable Membranes; Ignition; Thermal Diffusion In Gases; Thermography (imaging); Catalytic Combustion; Gas Diffusion Layers; Heat Transfer Model; Humidity Cycling; Imaging Method; Membrane Fuel Cells; Polymer Electrolyte Membranes; Temperature Rise; Thermal Imaging Method; Thermal-imaging; Electrolytes","Density of gases; Gas permeable membranes; Ignition; Thermal diffusion in gases; Thermography (imaging); Catalytic combustion; Gas diffusion layers; Heat transfer model; Humidity cycling; Imaging method; Membrane fuel cells; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Temperature rise; Thermal imaging method; Thermal-imaging; Electrolytes","","","This work was supported by The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology, code number of Project: T2023-02-27.","Mathias, M.

These methods find applications in diverse fields, including 3D modeling, robotics, rehabilitation, and physiotherapy. However, each approach necessitates a significant number of sensors for accurate hand kinematic measurement. Data gloves, in particular, are prone to calibration issues, and they may encounter missing information due to fault sensors. Defects in these sensors can lead to safety and accuracy issues, especially in the context of using hand kinematics to control robots, particularly in remote surgery as shown that hand kinematic reconstruction is significant to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of hand kinematic analysis across various applications. This paper focuses on hand kinematic signals reconstruction from fault sensors using only measured signals, employing a compressed sensing technique. The proposed sparse sensor placement technique aims to reconstruct all fault signals with suitable accuracy by utilizing measured signals. To evaluate the performance of proposed methods, The Percentage Root-Mean-Square Difference (PRD) used to compare reconstructed signals with ground truth. The results of average PRD shown that the number of faulty sensors directly affects the quality of the reconstruction.

However, practical applications face challenges as the actual number of states is often unknown, and observed variables may be limited. Additionally, unstable systems present further difficulties, as their outputs rapidly diverge or saturate, hindering long-term measurement. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel input-aware modeling method for unstable linear systems using data-driven Koopman analysis. Unlike traditional Koopman analysis which focuses solely on state dynamics, our method explicitly incorporates the influence of the input function u(t). This enables us to accurately capture the complete behavior of the system, even under the influence of external control signals. By leveraging Koopman operator theory on augmented state-input data, we capture both the intrinsic dynamics and the sensitivity to external control, crucial for accurate prediction and control of unstable systems. This input-aware approach extends the capabilities of data-driven Koopman analysis to improve modeling and control of complex unstable systems in various applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Havok Algorithm; Sparse Modeling; System Identification; Religious Buildings; Control Techniques; Data Driven; External Control; Havok Algorithm; Input Output Map; Modern Control; Sparse Models; System-identification; Unstable Linear Systems; Unstable System; Linear Systems","Religious buildings; Control techniques; Data driven; External control; HAVOK algorithm; Input output map; Modern control; Sparse models; System-identification; Unstable linear systems; Unstable system; Linear systems","","","","Liu, Kunzhi, Model-Based Dynamic Event-Triggered Control for Systems with Uncertainty: A Hybrid System Approach, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 66, 1, pp. 444-451, (2021); Liu, Yuezhi, Dynamic Memory Event-Triggered Adaptive Control for a Class of Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, 69, 8, pp. 3470-3474, (2022); Crenna, Francesco, A global approach to assessing uncertainty in biomechanical inverse dynamic analysis: Mathematical model and experimental validation, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 70, (2021); Fischer, Andreas, Signature Verification Based on the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements, IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems, 47, 2, pp. 169-180, (2017); Shafi, Sobia, Observer based state feedback controller design of a DC servo motor using identified motor model: An experimental study, (2023); Fouka, Majda, Full Order Observer With Unmatched Constraint: Unknown Parameters Identification, IEEE Control Systems Letters, 3, 4, pp. 1026-1031, (2019); Discovering Governing Equations from Partial Measurements with Deep Delay Autoencoders, (2022); Audoly, Stefania, Global identifiability of nonlinear models of biological systems, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 48, 1, pp. 55-65, (2001); Audoly, Stefania, Global identifiability of linear compartmental models - A computer algebra algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 45, 1, pp. 36-47, (1998); Wei, Yusheng, Parameter Identification of Discrete-time Linear Time-invariant Systems Using State and Input Data, International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems, 22, 1, pp. 333-346, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology Association (ECTI Association); IEEE Computer Thailand Chapter; IEEE Thailand Section","21st International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2024","","Khon Kaen; Science Park, Khon Khan University","201421","","9798350381559","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201143560"

The goal is to build upon the resonance state observed in previous adaptive-tuned vibration absorber research by integrating a converter to transform mechanical energy into electrical energy. The system dynamically tunes itself in response to varying excitation frequencies. In this design, a Cone CVT is installed between the pendulum stem and the dynamo. Additionally, a conventional PID controller is employed to adjust the wheel position. A mathematical model is developed to predict system response and performance for different design parameters. MATLAB ODE45 and ODE23 solvers are utilized for simulation, generating data for dynamic system analysis. The analytical model is validated by tuning the frequency within the range of 1 to 5.24 rad/s. The outcomes demonstrate that, following the tuning algorithm, the pendulum enters a resonance state, leading to a significant increase in output voltage, approximately 10 times compared to the initial value. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auto-tuning Harvester; Cone Continuous Variable Transmission; Energy Harvesting; Pid Controller; Renewable Energy; Tunable Frequency; Electric Control Equipment; Electric Power Transmission; Matlab; Pendulums; Three Term Control Systems; Tuning; Vibrations (mechanical); Auto-tuning Harvester; Autotuning; Cone Continuous Variable Transmission; Continuous Variable Transmissions; Energy Harvester; Pid Controllers; Renewable Energies; Resonance State; Tunable Frequency; Tunables; Energy Harvesting","Electric control equipment; Electric power transmission; MATLAB; Pendulums; Three term control systems; Tuning; Vibrations (mechanical); Auto-tuning harvester; Autotuning; Cone continuous variable transmission; Continuous variable transmissions; Energy Harvester; PID controllers; Renewable energies; Resonance state; Tunable frequency; Tunables; Energy harvesting","","","","Pecunia, Vincenzo, Roadmap on energy harvesting materials, JPhys Materials, 6, 4, (2023); Chen, Jiatong, Pendulum Energy Harvesters: A Review, Energies, 15, 22, (2022); Punyakaew, Surat, Adaptively tuned vibration absorber using cone based continuously variable transmission, Cogent Engineering, 9, 1, (2022); Ouakad, Hassen M., Vibration-Based Energy Harvesters: New Ways to Scavenge Energy, Energies, 16, 13, (2023); Modern Control Systems, (1998); Ahmed, Salman, A review on the integration of radiative cooling and solar energy harvesting, Materials Today Energy, 21, (2021); Vullers, Ruud J.M., Micropower energy harvesting, Solid-State Electronics, 53, 7, pp. 684-693, (2009); Beeby, Stephen P., Energy harvesting vibration sources for microsystems applications, Measurement Science and Technology, 17, 12, pp. R175-R195, (2006)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology Association (ECTI Association); IEEE Computer Thailand Chapter; IEEE Thailand Section","21st International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2024","","Khon Kaen; Science Park, Khon Khan University","201421","","9798350381559","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201142254"

However, as the EV population expands, issues pertaining to power quality, such as voltage stability and load profiles, have emerged. Various solutions have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of EV charging. One such approach involves the amalgamation of renewable energy sources (RES) within charging infrastructure, coupled with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. In this article, a new method is presented that utilizes RES in conjunction with the Forward Dynamic Programming Algorithm to lower the cost of charging all EVs.

The in-teractions among the entities involved are modelled using the Stackelberg game, while Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) is achieved through a distributed algorithm utilizing local information only. The numerical analysis indicates that demand response (DR) programs play a crucial role in enabling the GO to operate the power system reliably and economically. Moreover, a comparison between the two case studies reveals that implementing shorter timeframes for DR programs can yield enhanced demand reduction by residential consumers (RCs), resulting in potential cost savings and increased revenue for service providers facilitated by effective incentives.

Recently, non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensor based on metal oxides have been paid attention to develop thank to their outstanding behaviours. In most of these studies, metal oxides were synthesized individually and subsequently deposited on the electrode surface using a binder. In this study, we aim at developing a non-enzymatic glucose sensor based on NiO nanoflowers directly grown on a commercial pencil graphite electrode. NiO matetials were deposited on the electrode without a binder via a facile and low-cost chemical procedure. The synthesised materials’ morphologies and components of were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses. Electrocatalytic performance was recorded by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The resulting NiO nanoflowers, characterized by funnel-shaped structures measuring 500-600 nm in diameter and 20 nm in thickness, were formed on the pencil graphite electrode. The fabricated electrode showed a remarkably high sensitivity of 337 μA mM−1 cm−2, a low limit of detection of 4 μM, and good selectivity. The fabricated electrode can be a potential candidate for clinically medical applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chronoamperometry; Cyclic Voltammetry; Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy; Field Emission Microscopes; Glucose; Glucose Sensors; Graphite Electrodes; Medical Applications; Nanoflowers; Scanning Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction Analysis; Direct Growth; Electrochemical Glucose Sensors; Glucose Measurements; Glucose Sensing; Metal-oxide; Non-enzymatic; Nonenzymatic Sensor; One-step Methods; Pencil Graphite Electrode; Synthesised; Nickel Oxide","Chronoamperometry; Cyclic voltammetry; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Field emission microscopes; Glucose; Glucose sensors; Graphite electrodes; Medical applications; Nanoflowers; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Direct growth; Electrochemical glucose sensors; Glucose measurements; Glucose sensing; Metal-oxide; Non-enzymatic; Nonenzymatic sensor; One-step methods; Pencil graphite electrode; Synthesised; Nickel oxide","","","This research is funded by the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) under project number B2022-BKA-25 CTVL.","Lu, Wangdong, CuO nanothorn arrays on three-dimensional copper foam as an ultra-highly sensitive and efficient nonenzymatic glucose sensor, RSC Advances, 6, 20, pp. 16474-16480, (2016); Wang, Xiaolin, Electrochemical co-reduction synthesis of graphene/nano-gold composites and its application to electrochemical glucose biosensor, Electrochimica Acta, 112, pp. 774-782, (2013); Meng, Shangjun, Cobalt oxide nanosheets wrapped onto nickel foam for non-enzymatic detection of glucose, Nanotechnology, 27, 34, (2016); Heller, Adam, Electrochemical glucose sensors and their applications in diabetes management, Chemical Reviews, 108, 7, pp. 2482-2505, (2008); Chawla, Mohit, Effect of composition and calcination on the enzymeless glucose detection of Cu-Ag bimetallic nanocomposites, Materials Today Communications, 26, (2021); Wang, Joseph, Glucose biosensors: 40 Years of advances and challenges, Electroanalysis, 13, 12, pp. 983-988, (2001); Wilson, Robert, Glucose oxidase: an ideal enzyme, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 7, 3, pp. 165-185, (1992); Shamsabadi, Amir Shahin, Electrochemical non-enzymatic sensing of glucose by gold nanoparticles incorporated graphene nanofibers, Materials Today Communications, 24, (2020); Safavi, Afsaneh A., Fabrication of a glucose sensor based on a novel nanocomposite electrode, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 24, 6, pp. 1655-1660, (2009); Singer, Natasha, Nanostructured nickel oxide electrodes for non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensing, Microchimica Acta, 187, 4, (2020)","","Institute of Physics","","","","","","19457111; 00134651","","JESOA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182878201"

Attainment of net zero requires accelerated systemic decarbonization measures to catalyze fundamental changes across multiple societal systems simultaneously. Yet the extant literature has not conceptually clarified conditions leading to accelerated systemic decarbonization in cities. This research therefore aims to: (1) conceptualize strategies that contribute to accelerated systemic decarbonization at the sub-national level and develop a framework for empirically identifying these; and (2) assess the extent to which CAPs in cities known for progressive climate policies embody these characteristics. This involved examination of evidence from CAPs and related documents in six cities: Copenhagen, Leeds, Oslo, San Francisco, Australian Capital Territory and Kyoto. Findings show that San Francisco's climate actions are the most indicative of accelerated systemic decarbonization. In other cities, although many ingredients for accelerated systemic decarbonization are in place, several missed opportunities to achieve more rapid and transformative decarbonization outcomes were identified. These include lack of consideration of scope 3 emissions and limited participatory governance measures as well as absence of economic planning, climate budgets and financial indicators to estimate the benefits or costs of various climate-mitigation actions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accelerated Decarbonization; City Climate Policy; Climate Action Plans; Emission Reduction Measures; Net Zero Targets; Systemic Change; Budget Control; Emission Control; Accelerated Decarbonization; Action Plan; City Climate Policy; Climate Action Plan; Climate Policy; Decarbonisation; Emission Reduction; Emission Reduction Measure; Net Zero Target; Reduction Measures; Systemic Change; Decarbonization; Emission Control; Environmental Planning; Environmental Policy; Mitigation; Australia; California; Copenhagen [(cty) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; England; Honshu; Hovedstaden; Japan; Kinki; Kyoto [kinki]; Kyoto [kyoto (prf)]; Leeds [england]; Leeds [leeds (dst)]; Norway; Oslo [norway]; Oslo [oslo (cnt)]; San Francisco [california]; United Kingdom; United States","Budget control; Emission control; Accelerated decarbonization; Action plan; City climate policy; Climate action plan; Climate policy; Decarbonisation; Emission reduction; Emission reduction measure; Net zero target; Reduction measures; Systemic change; Decarbonization; emission control; environmental planning; environmental policy; mitigation; Australia; California; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; England; Honshu; Hovedstaden; Japan; Kinki; Kyoto [Kinki]; Kyoto [Kyoto (PRF)]; Leeds [England]; Leeds [Leeds (DST)]; Norway; Oslo [Norway]; Oslo [Oslo (CNT)]; San Francisco [California]; United Kingdom; United States","","","Barrett gratefully acknowledges support from the Center for Co*Design and the Center for Global Initiatives at Osaka University.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that regular paper-based records are vulnerable to both physical destruction and the act of fabrication, while standard databases can have security holes. Moreover, the process of manually gathering physical papers from centralized organizations is both laborious and complicated. To address the concerns above and foster sustainability in the field of education, this study first suggests using Scorechain. This innovative solution integrates blockchain technology into a comprehensive data-management system for managing all student-related data. Secondly, by utilizing the inherent security features of blockchain technology, Scorechain develops a stable multi-role hierarchy, increasing the integrity and reliability of data. This also facilitates the efficient transfer of information among various stakeholders, including parents, recruiters, and educational institutions, thus fostering transparency and accountability. Lastly, the Scorechain system facilitates collaboration and data exchange among universities inside a shared network. Scorechain was constructed using the Rust programming language and is based on the Substrate blockchain architecture. It underwent careful development, testing, and analysis to ensure operational efficiency. The feasibility and long-term viability of Scorechain in genuine educational contexts are highlighted as blockchain technology facilitates seamless integration into the education sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Education 4.0; Smart Campus; Sustainable Education; Connectivity; Education; Institutional Framework; Stakeholder; Sustainability; University Sector","connectivity; education; institutional framework; stakeholder; sustainability; university sector","","","","Well Being of Nations the Role of Human and Social Capital, (2001); Putro, Prasetyo Adi Wibowo, An Authentic and Secure Printed Document from Forgery Attack by Combining Perceptual Hash and Optical Character Recognition, pp. 157-162, (2019); Grolleau, Gilles, An introduction to the economics of fake degrees, Journal of Economic Issues, 42, 3, pp. 673-694, (2008); Diploma and Accreditation Mills New Trends in Credential Abuse, (2011); Proceedings of 1st Ercim Blockchain Workshop 2018, (2018); Malsa, Nitima, Framework and smart contract for blockchain enabled certificate verification system using robotics, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 960, pp. 125-138, (2021); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Von-Eitzen-Delgado, Christian, Blockchain applications in education: A systematic literature review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 24, (2021); Zhao, Mao, Blockchain in Online Learning: A Systematic Review and Bibliographic Visualization, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 2, (2023); Arndt, Timothy, Blockchain-based transcripts for mobile higher-education, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10, 2, pp. 84-89, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185924009"

Even though electrolyser is known to account for a large portion of the investment costs, there is still a lack of sizing models for this equipment, which can negatively affect the feasibility of plants. Moreover, the impacts of future technology maturity and cost reduction on the feasibility of hydrogen production plants are rarely analysed and reported. Realising the research gaps from previous studies, this paper proposes a comprehensive feasibility assessment model for green hydrogen production from dedicated offshore wind and PV plants, utilising net present value, discounted payback time, and levelised cost of energy and of hydrogen (LCOH) as economic evaluation criteria. Furthermore, a unique sizing model is presented, allowing the optimal electrolyser size with the lowest LCOH to be found. Two case studies investigating a hypothetical offshore wind farm in Scotland and a hypothetical PV farm in Vietnam to produce green hydrogen have been carried out, in which the impacts of technology maturity and cost reduction on the LCOH are analysed. It is projected that the LCOH in Scotland and Vietnam case studies, with specific conditions and assumptions of the two cases, would reduce from 3.10 and 3.05 $/kg in 2030 to the lowest values of 2.16 and 1.59 $/kg in 2050, respectively. Additionally, the optimal electrolyser capacity is found to equal 89.3% of the offshore wind plant capacity, and 57.7% of the PV plant capacity. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted, which revealed the capital cost of renewable energy plants has the most significant effect on the final LCOH. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrolyser Sizing; Green Hydrogen Production; Offshore Wind Farm; Pv Farm; Techno-economic Assessment; Cost Benefit Analysis; Cost Reduction; Economic Analysis; Electric Utilities; Hydrogen Production; Investments; Offshore Oil Well Production; Sensitivity Analysis; Solar Power Generation; Case-studies; Electrolyser Sizing; Electrolysers; Green Hydrogen Production; Levelised Cost Of Energies; Pv Farm; Scotland; Techno-economic Assessment; Viet Nam; Wind Plant; Offshore Wind Farms","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Electric utilities; Hydrogen production; Investments; Offshore oil well production; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Case-studies; Electrolyser sizing; Electrolysers; Green hydrogen production; Levelised cost of energies; PV farm; Scotland; Techno-economic assessment; Viet Nam; Wind plant; Offshore wind farms","","","This research has been funded by OWC, ABL Group .

Nevertheless, the operation of PV systems is adversely affected by the intermittence of meteorological factors, such as solar irradiance. Therefore, accurate PV power generation forecast has played a vital role to stimulate the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This study proposes a novel scheme for short-term PV power forecast based on Transformer Neural Network (TransNN) integrated with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In addition, Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is adopted in the data pre-processing stage to enhance the forecast accuracy. The performance of the proposed model is validated utilizing two real-world datasets, and five benchmark models are dedicated to forecast outcome comparison. The predicted results indicated the superiority of the proposed model compared to the referenced models by achieving the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values under 1 kW in all cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; Short-term Pv Power Forecasting; Transformer Neural Network; Variational Mode Decomposition; Benchmarking; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Data Handling; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Renewable Energy Resources; Convolutional Neural Network; Energy; Learning Models; Neural-networks; Photovoltaic Power; Power Forecast; Power Forecasting; Renewables; Short-term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting; Transformer Neural Network; Variational Mode Decomposition","Benchmarking; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; Convolutional neural network; Energy; Learning models; Neural-networks; Photovoltaic power; Power forecast; Power forecasting; Renewables; Short-term photovoltaic power forecasting; Transformer neural network; Variational mode decomposition","","","","Ahmed, Razin, A review and evaluation of the state-of-the-art in PV solar power forecasting: Techniques and optimization, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 124, (2020); Stoyanov, Ludmil S., Application of ANN for forecasting of PV plant output power - Case study oryahovo, (2021); Park, Neungsoo, Multi-Layer RNN-based Short-term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting using IoT Dataset, (2019); Hochreiter, Sepp, Long Short-Term Memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Agga, Ali, CNN-LSTM: An efficient hybrid deep learning architecture for predicting short-term photovoltaic power production, Electric Power Systems Research, 208, (2022); Nguyen, Duc Tuyen, A combination of novel hybrid deep learning model and quantile regression for short-term deterministic and probabilistic PV maximum power forecasting, IET Renewable Power Generation, 17, 4, pp. 794-813, (2023); Batch Normalization Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift, (2015); Attention is all You Need, (2017); Seatuc J Sci Eng, (2022); Dragomiretskiy, Konstantin, Variational mode decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 62, 3, pp. 531-544, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524847","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163538603"

However, the stochastic characteristic of renewable energy sources makes it a considerable challenge when designing a microgrid. Appropriate installation of energy storage systems (ESSs) such as battery and hydrogen storage systems are needed to counter the intermittent nature of energy sources. This study presents a comparison and evaluation of eight different metaheuristic approaches for optimizing the size of a hydrogen storage-based microgrid, with the aims of minimizing the microgrid's cost and ensuring the ability to regulate the energy flow within the system. In addition, the optimization algorithm considers the power of the photovoltaic (PV) system, electrolyzer, fuel cell, and the capacity of the battery and hydrogen tank as decision variables. Results of numerical simulations proved that, under the above problem framework, the particle swarm optimization algorithm outperforms the rest.

A grid code requires wind farms to remain on-grid and inject a specific reactive current when a grid fault occurs. The requirements are satisfied by a cooperative control scheme of a battery energy storage system (BESS) and grid-side converter (GSC) for improving the LVRT capacity of wind turbine generators using permanent magnet synchronous generators. The proposed approach uses the BESS to absorb a power difference that appears in the back-to-back converters during the LVRT operation. Hence, the DC-link voltage is regulated by the BESS. In addition, the GSC control allows reactive current to be injected into the grid according to the grid code requirements. Finally, the wind turbine generators, which use the proposed approach, are built in MATLAB/Simulink. The theoretical analysis of the proposed method is validated by simulation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bess; Coordinated Controller; Lvrt; Pmsg; Battery Storage; Electric Batteries; Matlab; Permanent Magnets; Power Control; Power Converters; Reactive Power; Turbogenerators; Wind Farm; Wind Turbine Generators; Battery Energy Storage Systems; Coordinated Controllers; Grid-connected; Lower Voltage Ride Through; Pmsg; Reactive Currents; Ride-through Control; Ridethrough Capability; Wind Power Plants; Wind Turbine Generators; Synchronous Generators","Battery storage; Electric batteries; MATLAB; Permanent magnets; Power control; Power converters; Reactive power; Turbogenerators; Wind farm; Wind Turbine Generators; Battery energy storage systems; Coordinated controllers; Grid-connected; Lower Voltage Ride Through; PMSG; Reactive currents; Ride-through control; Ridethrough capability; Wind power plants; Wind turbine generators; Synchronous generators","","","","Ahmed, Shakir D., Grid Integration Challenges of Wind Energy: A Review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 10857-10878, (2020); Mahela, Om Prakash, Comprehensive overview of low voltage ride through methods of grid integrated wind generator, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 99299-99326, (2019); Nasiri, Mojtaba, Robust control scheme for the braking chopper of PMSG-based wind turbines–A comparative assessment, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 134, (2022); Huang, Pohsu, Fault ride-through configuration and transient management scheme for self-excited induction generator-based wind turbine, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 1, pp. 148-159, (2014); Howlader, Abdul Motin, A comprehensive review of low voltage ride through capability strategies for the wind energy conversion systems, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 56, pp. 643-658, (2016); Kim, Chunghun, Low-Voltage Ride-Through Coordinated Control for PMSG Wind Turbines Using De-Loaded Operation, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 66599-66606, (2021); Kim, Chunghun, Enhanced Low-Voltage Ride-Through Coordinated Control for PMSG Wind Turbines and Energy Storage Systems Considering Pitch and Inertia Response, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 212557-212567, (2020); Wang, Jian, Low voltage ride-through control strategy for a wind turbine with permanent magnet synchronous generator based on operating simultaneously of rotor energy storage and a discharging resistance, Energy Reports, 8, pp. 5861-5870, (2022); Qais, Mohammed H., A Grey Wolf Optimizer for Optimum Parameters of Multiple PI Controllers of a Grid-Connected PMSG Driven by Variable Speed Wind Turbine, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 44120-44128, (2018); Geng, Hua, Synchronization and Reactive Current Support of PMSG-Based Wind Farm during Severe Grid Fault, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 9, 4, pp. 1596-1604, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524847","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160539297"

Composting has demonstrated its practicality and feasibility for addressing this issue; however, the lack of at-source solid waste separation remains a major challenge. As a result, in this study, the first sustainable MSW separation at source was conducted in Tan An City, Long An Province. The objective of this study was to evaluate the compost process and quality using Tan An City’s separated biodegradable organic solid waste as the raw material, through a windrow composting process with active aeration. Biodegradable organic waste, slow-biodegradable organic waste and plastic waste accounted for 84.5%, 15.1% and 0.4%, respectively, of the total waste. The pH, moisture, volatile solid percentage, total nitrogen, total organic carbon and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the separated solid waste were 8.7 ± 0.4, 76.8 ± 1.9%, 68.3 ± 1.3%, 2.1 ± 0.1%, 35.7 ± 2.2% and 17 ± 0.8, respectively. Rice straw was mixed with solid waste as a bulking material in a 31%:69% ratio to achieve a moisture content of 55% in the mixture. After 10 weeks, an evaluation of the compost’s quality revealed its potential suitability for agricultural applications. Notably, Salmonella was not detected in the compost, and the heavy metal levels were below standard limits, indicating the safety of the compost. To ensure optimal nutrient levels for effective plant growth, a slight nitrogen and phosphorus supplement was recommended. Aligned with the C/N ratio of 12.1 and a consistent temperature of approximately 29 °C, this indicates a high degree of maturity and stability in the composting process. The framework of this study demonstrates the effectiveness of at-source MSW separation in paving a sustainable path for MSW management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nutrients Recovery; Source-separated Biodegradable Municipal Solid Waste; Waste Management; Windrow Compost; Compost; Composting; Heavy Metal; Moisture Content; Municipal Solid Waste; Plastic Waste; Total Organic Carbon; Viet Nam","compost; composting; heavy metal; moisture content; municipal solid waste; plastic waste; total organic carbon; Viet Nam","","","","More Growth Less Garbage, (2021); What A Waste 2 0 A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050, (2018); Wong, Y.

To achieve the goal of popularizing OF, besides encouraging the participation of newcomers, the government should also focus on farmers already involved because their production decisions are the most effective means for communication. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated smallholder farmer intentions to scale up organic rice farming (ORF). Data were obtained through direct interviews with 325 farmers in the Phu Vang, Phong Dien and Huong Thuy Districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The results revealed the ineffectiveness in demographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, number of laborers, OF experience, percentage of organic rice area, non-farm jobs and involvement in community-based organizations to predict farmer intentions to expand ORF. The findings highlighted the more significant influence of factors related to economic outcomes, farmer awareness of OF, and their confidence in the market outlook.

Our findings on structural parameters agree strongly with the experimental values, with an average error of less than 1%. The acoustic Debye temperature of the boron nitride (BN) polytype is about 1680 K for h-B2N2, 1877 K for c-B4N4, and 1880 K for w-B2N2. The specific heat capacities of h-B2N2, w-B2N2, and c-B4N4 are about 9.437, 7.895, and 3.91 J/(mol K) at 300 K, respectively. To identify significant features and understand the sensitivity of BN polytypes, we estimate that the thermal conductivities for h-B2N2, w-B2N2, and c-B4N4 are 3.905, 10.156, and 22.038 W/(m K) at 300 K, respectively. The elastic constants state that the BN polytypes are mechanically stable and h-B2N2 has a strong anisotropy. The electronic structures reveal that w-B2N2 has a direct band gap of 5.232 eV, while h-B2N2 and c-B4N4 are wide- and indirect-band-gap semiconductors with band gaps of 4.329 and 4.530 eV, respectively. The maximum absorption coefficients in the investigated energy range are 538.50 and 513.66 cm-1 for c-B4N4 and w-B2N2, respectively. The spectra of the K-edge (1s) of the B and N sites have a sharp π* and a broader σ* in the energy region between 5 and 50 eV. These results indicate that BN is a promising material for heat dissipation and has a lot of potential in the development of novel microelectronic devices because of their low density, exceptional strength, high flexibility and stretchability, good thermal stability, and excellent impermeability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anisotropy; Boron Nitride; Density (specific Gravity); Electronic Structure; Energy Gap; Iii-v Semiconductors; Lattice Vibrations; Local Density Approximation; Nitrides; Optical Correlation; Raman Scattering; Specific Heat; Structural Properties; Thermal Conductivity; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Anisotropy Property; Cambridge; Density-functional-theory; Elastic Anisotropy; Electronic.structure; First Principle Calculations; Mulliken Populations; Polytypes; Total Energy; X-ray Photoelectrons; Optical Properties","Anisotropy; Boron nitride; Density (specific gravity); Electronic structure; Energy gap; III-V semiconductors; Lattice vibrations; Local density approximation; Nitrides; Optical correlation; Raman scattering; Specific heat; Structural properties; Thermal conductivity; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Anisotropy property; Cambridge; Density-functional-theory; Elastic anisotropy; Electronic.structure; First principle calculations; Mulliken populations; Polytypes; Total energy; X-ray photoelectrons; Optical properties","","","This research was partially supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research No. 21K14510 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 62264015).

The research results show that the electrochemical efficiency of all mixed nickel-cobalt oxalate is significantly enhanced compared to pristine nickel oxalate, cobalt oxalate and depends on the molar ratio of Ni:Co. We found that, mixed nickel-cobalt oxalates synthesized in the Ni:Co molar ratio between 3:2 and 2:3 had the most outstanding electrochemical performance. Specifically, the NiCo-ox2/NiCo-ox3 samples deliver a specific capacitance of 2018.5/2088.1 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (or 1219.6/1365.9 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1), ca. 200–600 % higher than that of nickel oxalate and cobalt oxalate.

Remarkable, the asymmetric supercapacitor (NiCo-ox2//AC-ASC) is made from NiCo-ox2 as the anode and active carbon as cathode delivered a maximum specific energy of 25.65 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 750 W kg−1, maintains 84.12 % specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. Therefore, this work provides an efficient solution to preparing high-performance materials for supercapacitor electrodes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Composition Control; High-performance Electrode Materials; Mixed Nickel-cobalt Oxalates; Supercapacitor; Anodes; Capacitance; Cathodes; Cobalt; Cobalt Compounds; Current Density; Electric Discharges; Molar Ratio; Nickel; Oxalic Acid; Composition Control; Composition Ratio; Electrode Material; Facile Synthesis; High-performance Electrode Material; Mixed Nickel-cobalt Oxalate; Performance; Specific Capacitance; Synthesised; Supercapacitor","Anodes; Capacitance; Cathodes; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Current density; Electric discharges; Molar ratio; Nickel; Oxalic acid; Composition control; Composition ratio; Electrode material; Facile synthesis; High-performance electrode material; Mixed nickel-cobalt oxalate; Performance; Specific capacitance; Synthesised; Supercapacitor","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number: 15/2022/TN .","Turk J Mater, (2020); Poonam, Review of supercapacitors: Materials and devices, Journal of Energy Storage, 21, pp. 801-825, (2019); Phat, Doan Tien, Morphology controlled synthesis of battery-type NiCo2O4 supported on nickel foam for high performance hybrid supercapacitors, Journal of Energy Storage, 33, (2021); González, Ander, Review on supercapacitors: Technologies and materials, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 58, pp. 1189-1206, (2016); Cao, Mengjue, Free-standing porous carbon foam as the ultralight and flexible supercapacitor electrode, Carbon, 161, pp. 224-230, (2020); Huang, Jing, 3D honeycomb-like carbon foam synthesized with biomass buckwheat flour for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes, Chemical Communications, 55, 62, pp. 9168-9171, (2019); Xu, Zhixiao, 3D Hierarchical Carbon-Rich Micro-/Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Catalysis, Electrochemical Energy Reviews, 4, 2, pp. 269-335, (2021); Thomas, Susmi Anna, MXene based hybrid materials for supercapacitors: Recent developments and future perspectives, Journal of Energy Storage, 55, (2022); Chen, Yucheng, MXene-Based Electrodes for Supercapacitor Energy Storage, Energy and Fuels, 36, 5, pp. 2390-2406, (2022); Vangari, Manisha, Supercapacitors: Review of materials and fabrication methods, Journal of Energy Engineering, 139, 2, pp. 72-79, (2013)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","2352152X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152890177"

While the literature is rich with studies on coconut-related export competitiveness and readiness, it seems that studies focused on a single set of factors, and very few studies take Vietnam as a case study for analysis. Studies we found use aggregate data for econometric analysis. On the contrary, this study attempts to address the literature’s gaps by proposing a comprehensive view of key factors identifying the export potential of bottled coconut water. It also adds to our comprehension of how large- and small-scale manufacturers prioritize factors differently. To answer the research questions, we collect qualitative and quantitative data for analysis. We use AHP and M-CRITIC-RP methods for ranking the factors. This study also incorporates the criteria weights into the gravity of the trade model to identify export potential to target markets. Our findings can draw researchers’ and policymakers’ attention to the importance of considering how firms and manufacturers prioritize key factors in export readiness, and thereby impact export potential and target markets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahp; Alternatives Ranking; Bottled Coconut Water; Criteria Weights; Export Readiness; Group Criteria Weights; M-critic-rp; Mcdm; Vietnam; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Competitiveness; Growth Rate; Multicriteria Analysis; Numerical Model; Ranking; Research Work; Sustainability; Viet Nam","analytical hierarchy process; competitiveness; growth rate; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; ranking; research work; sustainability; Viet Nam","","","","Debnath, Binoy, A Bayesian Best–Worst approach for assessing the critical success factors in sustainable lean manufacturing, Decision Analytics Journal, 6, (2023); Aschemann-Witzel, Jessica, Sustainable use of tropical fruits?

A two-stage model is implemented for clearing the energy and reserve markets. The costs of generation and reserve power are minimized first, and then the costs of variations in the management owing to the changes in wind turbine and photovoltaic (PV) are optimized. To optimize the objective function, an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) is used. Simulation results are provided for different case studies in a microgrid and the outcomes confirm the superiority of the recommended algorithm in comparison with other conventional approaches.

This study aimed to review the housing development process and policies in Japan and Vietnam, which are representatives for establishing a sustainable housing market in developed and developing economies. We first presented the situation of the Japanese housing market from the post-World War II period to the present, including three periods of economic development, recovery, development, and stabilization. We then reviewed implemented policies that greatly affected the changes in housing stock from shortage to fulfillment. Similarly, we summarized the main characteristics of the Vietnamese housing market and policies since the economic perspective changed. The experiences in both countries indicate that economic reform and the private sector play a substantial role in accomplishing the housing market balance. Notably, the study also pointed out a potential and existing crisis, including housing vacancy and affordability. We propose that understanding the current situation would help policymakers to consolidate the housing provision and mitigate the crisis effects. On the other hand, lessons learned from these two cases might be helpful for other countries to emulate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Zhang, Xingquan, Housing the planet: Evolution of global housing policies, Habitat International, 54, pp. 161-165, (2016); Choguill, Charles L., The search for policies to support sustainable housing, Habitat International, 31, 1, pp. 143-149, (2007); Envisaging the Future of Cities, (2022); Hc3 1 Homeless Population Estimates OECD Afford Hous Database, (2021); Sixth Overview of Housing Exclusion in Europe, (2021); Statistical Yearbook of Viet Nam 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020, (2021); 2019 Viet Nam Population and Housing Cencus, (2020); Zhang, Beibei, Why is japan's housing vacancy rate so high a history of postwar housing policy, Social Science Japan Journal, 23, 1, pp. 65-77, (2020); Housing Markets and Housing Policies in India, (2016); Stat Bur Minist Intern Aff Commun, (2018)","Grabovyi, P.G.","EDP Sciences","","12th International Scientific and Practical Forum on Environmentally Sustainable Cities and Settlements: Problems and Solutions, ESCP 2023","","Hanoi Capital","191165","25550403; 22671242","9782759890163; 9782759890552; 9782759890644","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170070111"

Hence, this study investigated students' behavior in choosing the LRT as a means of transport.

A Z-scheme photocatalyst comprising a Re(i) complex and a polymeric semiconductor (bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>)) converted CO<inf>2</inf> to CO even under the irradiation of low-intensity visible light. The electronic interaction between Re(i) and g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> units and the injection of electrons from g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> to the Re(i) complex improved the photocatalytic efficiency. The lower recombination of electron-hole pairs and the prolonged emission decay (the average emission lifetime τ = 5.8 ms) contributed to the increased overall efficiency of the hybrid system. The maximum turnover number (TON) of CO formation reached 28.56 after 240 min with a high CO selectivity (99.8%). Compared to the homogeneous photocatalyst Re(i), the TON of CO formation was increased by 5.6 times and CO selectivity was higher. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of the substrate-supported Re complex (Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>) on the CO<inf>2</inf> Reduction Reaction (CO2RR) activity. The results indicate that Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> presents a lower energy barrier for *CO<inf>2</inf> to *COOH conversion, promoting *COOH formation more effectively than pure g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>. Moreover, the energy barrier for *CO desorption is lower in Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> than in Re(bpy-COOH), suggesting a reduction in the strong binding of adsorbed CO intermediates, highlighting the intermediate ensemble effect at the active site. The improved CO2RR activity in Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> can be attributed to the balance between the enhancement of reaction activity and the binding energy of intermediates at the active site. The study of photocatalytic CO<inf>2</inf> reduction (PCO2R) under low-intensity-visible-light irradiation and DFT investigation has reveal an insight into the CO2RR activity for CO<inf>2</inf> reduction under various irradiation conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Binding Energy; Carbon Nitride; Density Functional Theory; Energy Barriers; Energy Policy; Global Warming; Heterojunctions; Hybrid Systems; Irradiation; Photocatalytic Activity; Reaction Intermediates; Rhenium Compounds; Co 2 Reduction; Co Formation; Co Selectivity; Low-intensity; Photo-catalytic; Re Complex; Reaction Activity; Reduction Reaction; Turnover Number; Visible-light-driven; Carbon Dioxide","Binding energy; Carbon nitride; Density functional theory; Energy barriers; Energy policy; Global warming; Heterojunctions; Hybrid systems; Irradiation; Photocatalytic activity; Reaction intermediates; Rhenium compounds; CO 2 reduction; CO formation; CO selectivity; Low-intensity; Photo-catalytic; Re complex; Reaction activity; Reduction reaction; Turnover number; Visible-light-driven; Carbon dioxide","","","The authors appreciate the financial support from Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under Grant Number CSCL19.03/23-24.

The experiments were conducted at Reynolds number of 2.45 × 105 based on the model height. A global luminescent oil film skin-friction measurement technique was applied for the flow fields on the slant and base surfaces. The aerodynamic forces of the model were measured to understand the effect of the deflection angle on the aerodynamic characteristics. The pressure was measured and pressure drags acting on the slant and base surfaces were also calculated. The results showed that the drag and lift of the model suddenly dropped at the deflection angle above −5°. The pressure distribution on the slant and base surfaces became flat with a maximum drag reduction of 8% for the model with a deflection angle of 0°. The skin-friction measurement indicated that the drag reduction was connected to the breakdown of the separation bubble and longitudinal vortices on the slant. At the fully separated flow state, the skin-friction results illustrated two small vortices and a counter-clockwise vortex on the slant. Additionally, the wake vortices shifted from horizontal to vertical structures.

Due to the lack of precise information on DMDA computation in earlier studies, this work proposes DMDA including fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag as a viable way to improve the long-term performance of green concrete. To encourage the use of DMDA, this study offers a detailed description of the DMDA mix design, as well as a step-by-step standard operating procedure and an empirical example of the computation. Assessments of the long-term performance of green mixtures (self-consolidating concrete and high-performance concrete) and ordinary Portland cement concrete (designed using the conventional method of American Concrete Institute, ACI) were made. Performances of the ACI (O6000 mixture) and DMDA concretes (S6000 and H6000 mixtures) were then compared in terms of compressive strength, elastic modulus, shrinkage, and creep strain. As a result, all of the concrete samples attained the target strength of above 41 MPa (6000 psi) after only 28 days. Moreover, compressive strength, elastic modulus, shrinkage, and creep strain increased significantly in all of the concretes over curing time.

The inhalation of these particles is known to be the origin of lung diseases, such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease. To compensate for the difficulty of experiments involving volunteers, in silico studies using numerical models have been adopted as promising alternatives. Therefore, this study applied the computational fluid and particle dynamics technique to investigate the deposition of ultrafine particles in the human respiratory tract from the nostrils to the ninth generation of bronchi. A computational model was created using computed tomography images. The airflow patterns were simulated under steady and incompressible conditions at breathing flow rates of 7.5 and 15 L/min, respectively. The discrete phase was simulated for ultrafine particles with aerodynamic diameters of 2-100 nm. Consequently, the validation work confirmed the simulation accuracy for particle sizes > 25 nm. In the lower respiratory system, the total deposition fraction decreased as the particle size increased. In addition, the eighth generation is a focal point of the deposited particles, elucidated by the local deposition fraction. The results of this study will benefit further studies involving health risk assessments and drug delivery. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study was partially funded by Japan Science and Technology (JST), CREST Japan (grant number JP 20356547), and JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) (Grant numbers JP 22H00237, JP 22K18300, JP 20KK0099), Health Labour Sciences Research Grant (JP 21KD2002), and MEXT as “Program for Promoting Researches on the Supercomputer Fugaku” (JPMXP1020210316).

Many engineering techniques have been proposed and applied to treat oily wastewater, but limited studies have investigated low-cost and effective techniques using by-products and waste/scrap materials from the construction industry. Materials to treat oily wastewater are needed not only to mitigate environmental pollution but also to promote the reuse and recycling of industrial by-products, especially in developing countries. This study, therefore, examined the sorption capacity of dispersed oil in wastewater (dispersed soybean oil in water; initial oil concentrations, C<inf>i</inf> = 10–1000 mg/L; oil droplet size in water <2 μm) onto the hydrophobized/oleophilized autoclaved porous aerated concrete (AAC) grains made from waste scrap in Vietnam by using batch sorption tests in the laboratory. The AAC grains (sizes 0.106–0.25, 0.25–0.85, and 0.85–2.00 mm) were hydrophobized/oleophilized using oleic and stearic acids (coating concentrations of 1.0, 5.0, and 10 g/kg), and two sands (0.18–2.00 and 0.30–2.00 mm) were used as control samples. The results showed that the hydrophobized/oleophilized AAC grains had high sorption capacity for dispersed oil (i.e., high oil removal efficiency) compared to the control sands. Especially, the removal of AAC grains coated with stearic acid was >80% in high oil concentration solutions (C<inf>i</inf> = 100 and 1000 mg/L), indicating that the hydrophobized/oleophilized AAC grains have high potential as useful adsorbents to trap dispersed oil in oily wastewater. Moreover, adsorption isotherms were drawn to examine the sorption characteristics of dispersed oil onto AAC grains. For all tested samples, the sorption of dispersed oil increased linearly with increasing equilibrium concentration. The commonly used Langmuir model, on the other hand, did not capture the measured isotherms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (aac); Dispersed Oil; Oily Wastewater; Sorption; Vietnam","","","","This research was supported by the project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

Although the impact of these policies is tremendous in increasing solar energy capacity, the latest policy for solar power expired at the end of 2020. To support the Vietnam government in promulgating the next incentive policy, this paper proposes a feasibility assessment model for rooftop solar policies, which enables the viability evaluation of policies from the perspective of both utility/entity and customer. By utilizing the policy options customized by users, the model generates a significant amount of technical and financial output to appreciate the impacts of potential policies under different scenarios. Five policy options have been simulated and evaluated using the proposed model. The output data shows the importance of the FIT rate in establishing the feasibility of a rooftop solar project, where the higher the FIT rate, the lower the feasibility for the utility, and vice versa. By using the output data from the proposed model, policymakers can have a better view of the impacts of different policies under different scenarios, which results in the development and implementation of more impactful policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assessment Model; Feed In Tariff; Net Metering; Rooftop Solar Policy; Assessment Models; Case-studies; Feasibility Assessment; Feed-in Tariff; Incentives Policy; Net Metering; Output Data; Policy Options; Rooftop Solar Policy; Viet Nam; Solar Energy; Assessment Method; Electricity Supply; Energy Policy; Policy Implementation; Solar Power; Tariff Structure","Assessment models; Case-studies; Feasibility assessment; Feed-in tariff; Incentives policy; Net metering; Output data; Policy options; Rooftop solar policy; Viet Nam; Solar energy; assessment method; electricity supply; energy policy; policy implementation; solar power; tariff structure","","","The authors of this article would like to show their appreciation to the members of 100% Renewable Energy Lab, Hanoi University of Science and Technology for their support in the drafting process of this article.

Several factors related to the formation of zeolite, such as mixing ratios, aging time, and reaction time, were investigated. Furthermore, the potential phosphate adsorption of the optimal synthesized zeolite was evaluated. RESULTS: Under the optimal conditions (SiO<inf>2</inf>/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> molar ratio = 4.0, NaOH concentration = 1.5 M, aging time = 12 h, and reaction time = 8 h), the surface area and pore diameter of the zeolite NaP1 obtained were 50 m2 g−1 and 40.77 Å, respectively. By varying the aging and reaction times, zeolite NaP1 with different surface areas could be created. Specifically, reducing the aging time and reaction time result in zeolite NaP1 with a lower surface area. The adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity of the optimal synthesized zeolite NaP1 were 38.67% and 19.97 mg g−1, respectively, at pH 6.0, with an initial phosphate concentration of 100 mg L−1, an adsorbent dosage of 2 g L−1, and a contact time of 120 min. The data are well described under the Temkin and Redlich-Peterson models, with the correlation coefficients of 0.991 and 0.995, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of the Langmuir model reached 19.053 mg g−1. CONCLUSION: The main contribution of this work is the direct use of rice husk ash without pretreatment to generate high crystalline zeolite NaP1 in a shorter time. The phosphate ion removal efficiency by zeolite NaP1 may be further improved by functionalizing zeolite surfaces and expanding its other applications. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Phosphate; Rice Husk Ash; Short Aging Time; Zeolite Nap1; Phosphate; Silicon Dioxide; Chemical Industry; Efficiency; Molar Ratio; Silica; Sodium Hydroxide; Zeolites; Adsorption Capacities; Aging Reaction; Aging Time; Mixing Ratios; Rice-husk Ash; Short Aging Time; Surface Area; Synthesised; Synthesized Zeolite; Zeolite Nap1; Adsorption; Adsorbent; Aluminum Derivative; Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1; Phosphate; Silicon Dioxide; Zeolite; Adsorption; Aging; Article; Ash; Concentration (parameter); Contact Time; Controlled Study; Ph; Pore Size; Reaction Time; Rice Husk; Surface Area; Synthesis; Time; Waste Component Removal","Chemical industry; Efficiency; Molar ratio; Silica; Sodium hydroxide; Zeolites; Adsorption capacities; Aging reaction; Aging time; Mixing ratios; Rice-husk ash; Short aging time; Surface area; Synthesised; Synthesized zeolite; Zeolite nap1; Adsorption; adsorbent; aluminum derivative; nucleosome assembly protein 1; phosphate; silicon dioxide; zeolite; adsorption; aging; Article; ash; concentration (parameter); contact time; controlled study; pH; pore size; reaction time; rice husk; surface area; synthesis; time; waste component removal","","phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9","This research was funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant Number 103.02‐2020.64.","Goscianska, Joanna, Removal of phosphate from water by lanthanum-modified zeolites obtained from fly ash, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 513, pp. 72-81, (2018); Xu, Qianyu, Simultaneous removal of ammonia and phosphate using green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed onto zeolite, Science of the Total Environment, 703, (2020); Aljbour, Salah H., Phosphate removal from aqueous solutions by using natural Jordanian zeolitic tuff, Adsorption Science and Technology, 35, 3-4, pp. 284-299, (2017); Amiri, Mohammad Javad, Synthesis and optimization of spherical nZVI (20–60 nm) immobilized in bio-apatite-based material for efficient removal of phosphate: Box-Behnken design in a fixed-bed column, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 45, pp. 67751-67764, (2022); W Almanassra, Ismail W., A state of the art review on phosphate removal from water by biochars, Chemical Engineering Journal, 409, (2021); Wang, Junhong, Insight into the effect of structural characteristics of magnetic ZrO2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites on phosphate removal in water, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 249, (2020); Wei, Ting, Advanced phosphate removal by La–Zr–Zn ternary oxide: Performance and mechanism, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 817, (2020); Bessa, Raquel de Andrade, Kaolin-based magnetic zeolites A and P as water softeners, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 245, pp. 64-72, (2017); Yoldi, María, Zeolite synthesis from industrial wastes, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 287, pp. 183-191, (2019); Nakhli, Seyyed Ali Akbar, Application of Zeolites for Sustainable Agriculture: a Review on Water and Nutrient Retention, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 228, 12, (2017)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10974660; 02682575","","JCTBD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150910352"

Therefore, precise output power forecast is vital for both system operators and PV system owners to improve grid stability and generation quality, respectively. This article proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model named EDSACL comprising four components, namely, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), self-attention mechanism (SAm), and residual learning (RL) strategy for short-term PV maximum power prediction with forecast horizon of 1, 2, and 4 h. This proposed model initially extracts spatial-temporal features of input data based on CNN and LSTM before using SAm to achieve hidden features of LSTM layers. RL strategy is employed to maintain the information flow entering the network. Besides, interval prediction is also implemented based on a combination of the EDSACL model and quantile regression with different probabilities. The forecast accuracy of the proposed model is validated based on two real-world data sets. The predicted results show the superiority of the proposed model over numerous predictive models; in particular, mean absolute percentage error values of the proposed hybrid model are under 6% in all case studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Forecasting; Learning Systems; Multilayer Neural Networks; Renewable Energy Resources; Attention Mechanisms; Convolutional Neural Network; Deterministics; Learning Models; Learning Strategy; Maximum Power; Model Regressions; Photovoltaic Systems; Photovoltaics; Quantile Regression; Long Short-term Memory","Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Renewable energy resources; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional neural network; Deterministics; Learning models; Learning strategy; Maximum power; Model regressions; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Quantile regression; Long short-term memory","","","","Tsai, Yuching, Integrated Operation of Renewable Energy Sources and Water Resources, Energy Conversion and Management, 160, pp. 439-454, (2018); Renewables 2020, (2025); Ahmed, Razin, A review and evaluation of the state-of-the-art in PV solar power forecasting: Techniques and optimization, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 124, (2020); Raza, Muhammad Qamar, On recent advances in PV output power forecast, Solar Energy, 136, pp. 125-144, (2016); Rafati, Amir, High dimensional very short-term solar power forecasting based on a data-driven heuristic method, Energy, 219, (2021); Cordova, Samuel, An Efficient Forecasting-Optimization Scheme for the Intraday Unit Commitment Process under Significant Wind and Solar Power, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 9, 4, pp. 1899-1909, (2018); Abdel-Basset, Mohamed, PV-Net: An innovative deep learning approach for efficient forecasting of short-term photovoltaic energy production, Journal of Cleaner Production, 303, (2021); Agga, Ali, Short-term self consumption PV plant power production forecasts based on hybrid CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM models, Renewable Energy, 177, pp. 101-112, (2021); Renew Energy, (2021); Akhtar, Muhammad Naveed, Review on forecasting of photovoltaic power generation based on machine learning and metaheuristic techniques, IET Renewable Power Generation, 13, 7, pp. 1009-1023, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","17521424; 17521416","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141508006"

However, the DAB3 topology has limited soft-switching range, particularly under light load conditions when the voltage conversion ratio differs significantly from unity, resulting in hard switching, increased loss, and higher electromagnetic interference. To address these issues, various techniques have been proposed, but they often lead to other problems such as higher current ripple or unbalanced thermal distribution. In this paper, a new modulation scheme, called symmetric duty-cycle control (SDM), is proposed for DAB3 converters to overcome these issues. A multiaspect comparison of SDM was conducted against two existing techniques, SPS and ADCC, and its superiority was validated through simulation and experimental results. Our proposed SDM scheme provides a current ripple within 10% to 15% of the average current and enables zero current switching for the whole voltage and power ranges. Additionally, a modified version of SDM can even improve overall efficiency by 7% compared to the conventional SPS technique. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric Duty-cycle Control; Dual Active Bridge; Single-phase-shift; Symmetric Duty-cycle Control; Electric Vehicle; Electromagnetic Method; Equipment Component; Experimental Study; Model Validation; Topology","electric vehicle; electromagnetic method; equipment component; experimental study; model validation; topology","","","This study was funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2021-SAHEP-005.","Kempton, Willett M., Vehicle-to-grid power implementation: From stabilizing the grid to supporting large-scale renewable energy, Journal of Power Sources, 144, 1, pp. 280-294, (2005); Ota, Yutaka, Autonomous distributed V2G (vehicle-to-grid) satisfying scheduled charging, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 1, pp. 559-564, (2012); Chandra Mouli, Gautham Ram, Implementation of dynamic charging and V2G using Chademo and CCS/Combo DC charging standard, (2016); Chandra-Mouli, Gautham Ram, A 10 kW Solar-Powered Bidirectional EV Charger Compatible with Chademo and COMBO, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 34, 2, pp. 1082-1098, (2019); Inoue, Shigenori, A bidirectional DC-DC converter for an energy storage system with galvanic isolation, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 22, 6, pp. 2299-2306, (2007); Ting, Pang, A three phase ZVS bidirectional DC-DC converter, (2008); De Doncker, Rik W.A.A., A Three-Phase Soft-Switched High-Power-Density DC/DC Converter for High-Power Applications, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 27, 1, pp. 63-73, (1991); Zhao, Biao, Overview of dual-active-bridge isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter for high-frequency-link power-conversion system, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 29, 8, pp. 4091-4106, (2014); He, Peiwen, Comprehensive Analyses and Comparison of 1 kW Isolated DC-DC Converters for Bidirectional EV Charging Systems, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 3, 1, pp. 147-156, (2017); Haghbin, Saeid, The Design and Construction of Transformers for a 50 kW Three-Phase Dual Active Bridge DC/DC Converter, 2018-January, pp. 1-5, (2017)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186213194"

It is considered to be the most promising energy source in the next decade. Besides, the expanding trend for this technology requires the consideration of diversified seabeds. In deep seabeds, floating offshore wind technology (FOWT) is needed. For this latter technology, such as for conventional WT, we need to consider aspects related to performance, aerodynamic force, and forces during operation. In this paper, a two-bladed downwind wind turbine model is utilized to conduct experiments. The collective pitch and cyclic pitch angle are adjusted using swashplated equipment. The fluid forces and moments acting on the rotor surface are measured by a six-component balancing system. By changing the pitch angle of the wind turbine blades, attempts are made to manage the fluid forces generated on the rotor surface. Under varied uniform wind velocities of 7, 8, 9, and 10 m/s, the effect of collective pitch control and cyclic pitch control on the power coefficient and thrust coefficient of FOWT is then discussed. Furthermore, at a wind speed of 10 m/s, both the power coefficient and loads are investigated as the pitch angle and yaw angle change. Experimental results indicate that the combined moment magnitude can be controlled by changing the pitch-angle amplitude. The power coefficient is adjusted by the cyclic pitch-angle controller when the pitch-angle phase changes. In addition, the thrust coefficient fluctuated when the pitch angle changed in the oblique inflow wind condition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collective Pitch Control; Cyclic Pitch Control; Floating Offshore Wind Turbine; Load Reductions; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Offshore Wind Turbines; Turbomachine Blades; Wind Speed; Wind Tunnels; Collective Pitch Controls; Cyclic Pitch; Cyclic Pitch Control; Floating Offshore Wind Turbines; Load Reduction; Performance; Pitch Angle; Pitch-control; Power Coefficients; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Offshore Oil Well Production","Offshore wind turbines; Turbomachine blades; Wind speed; Wind tunnels; Collective pitch controls; Cyclic pitch; Cyclic pitch control; Floating offshore wind turbines; Load reduction; Performance; Pitch angle; Pitch-control; Power coefficients; Wind tunnel experiment; Offshore oil well production","","","","Global Energy Transformation A Roadmap to 2050, (2018); undefined; Offshore Wind Handbook, (2019); undefined; undefined; Worlds Most Powerful Wind Turbine Once Again Smashes 24 Hours Power Generation Record as 9 Mw Wind Turbine is Launched; J Eng, (2017); Lio, Alan W.H., Estimation and Control of Wind Turbine Tower Vibrations Based on Individual Blade-Pitch Strategies, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 27, 4, pp. 1820-1828, (2019); Kanev, Stoyan K., Exploring the limits in individual pitch control, 1, pp. 679-704, (2009); Coral-Enriquez, Horacio, Rejection of varying-frequency periodic load disturbances in wind-turbines through active disturbance rejection-based control, Renewable Energy, 141, pp. 217-235, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151416274"

Nuclear energy is one such source, and many thermal reactors are currently in operation. As a result, a huge amount of depleted uranium has been stored, and reprocessing plants or fast reactors operating in breed-and burn (B&B) mode are necessary for effective utilization of uranium source. In the present paper, we investigate the feasibility of a Rotational Fuel-shuffling breed-and-burn reactor with Nitride fuel and Lead coolant (RFBB-NL) with neutronic and thermal-hydraulic analyses. In order to establish a high neutron-economy B&B mode, the core is established with a Rotational Fuel-shuffling (RF) scheme. The present study confirms the feasibility of a small LFR design functioning in B&B operating mode by optimizing core height and operating parameters. We kept the maximum temperatures of fuel, cladding, and coolant under their constraints by performing a steady state thermal-hydraulic analysis for the hot channel of a shorter core with higher power. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Breed-and-burn Reactor; Lead Coolant; Nitride Fuel; Rfbb; Coolants; Fuel Economy; Lead Compounds; Nitrides; Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing; Uranium; Breed And Burns; Breed-and-burn Reactor; Energy; Global Demand; Lead Coolant; Nitride Fuel; Reactor Core Designs; Rfbb; Sustainable Energy Sources; Thermal-hydraulic Analysis; Fast Reactors","Coolants; Fuel economy; Lead compounds; Nitrides; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Uranium; Breed and burns; Breed-and-burn reactor; Energy; Global demand; Lead coolant; Nitride fuel; Reactor core designs; RFBB; Sustainable energy sources; Thermal-hydraulic analysis; Fast reactors","","","This work was supported by the National University of Mongolia under grant number P2022-4374, and by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.04-2020.06 .","Handbook of Nuclear Engineering, (2010); Handbook of Nuclear Engineering, (2010); Chadwick, Mark B., ENDF/B-VII.0: Next Generation Evaluated Nuclear Data Library for Nuclear Science and Technology, Nuclear Data Sheets, 107, 12, pp. 2931-3060, (2006); Comsol 4 2a Multiphysics Modeling Finite Element Analysis and Engineering Simulations Software, (2022); Dragunov, Yu G., Technical solutions and development stages for the BREST-OD-300 reactor unit, Atomic Energy, 113, 1, pp. 70-77, (2012); EPJ Web Conf, (2021); Eiselt, Ch Ch, ODS-materials for high temperature applications in advanced nuclear systems, Nuclear Materials and Energy, 9, pp. 22-28, (2016); Proc Int Congress Adv Nucl Power Plants, (2010); Rec of Proc Session B 10 Icpuae, (1958); Gilleland, John, The Traveling Wave Reactor: Design and Development, Engineering, 2, 1, pp. 88-96, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03064549; 18732100","0080286941","ANEND","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142873214"

The BESSs, on the other hand, have problems of high initial investment costs and limited lifetime. In this paper, a problem formulation and its solution are presented for sizing an aggregated BESS in a microgrid that minimizes the sum of initial costs of the aggregated BESS and operational costs of the microgrid. The target problem is originally categorized into a bilevel optimization because it comprises two optimization problems: the sizing of aggregated BESS and the operational scheduling of microgrid's components. The authors, however, apply the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker approach and reformulate the target problem as a single-level optimization problem. This reformulation enables us to treat the problem as if it was a type of operation scheduling problems. That is, the solution techniques developed to obtain the optimal operation scheduling are applicable by the problem reformulation. As the basis for the solution method, an algorithm combining binary particle swarm optimization and quadratic programming is applied in this paper. To verify the validity of the proposal, numerical simulations are performed, and their results are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battery Energy Storage Systems; Bilevel Optimization; Karush–kuhn–tucker Approach; Microgrids; Operation Scheduling Optimization; Sizing Optimization; Battery Storage; Economics; Electric Batteries; Particle Swarm Optimization (pso); Quadratic Programming; Scheduling; Battery Energy Storage Systems; Bi-level Optimization; Bi-level Optimization Models; Karush-kuhn-tucker Approaches; Microgrid; Operation Scheduling Optimization; Operations Scheduling; Optimization Problems; Scheduling Optimization; Sizing Optimization; Investments","Battery storage; Economics; Electric batteries; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quadratic programming; Scheduling; Battery energy storage systems; Bi-level optimization; Bi-level optimization models; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approaches; Microgrid; Operation scheduling optimization; Operations scheduling; Optimization problems; Scheduling optimization; Sizing optimization; Investments","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI grant number 19K04325) .","undefined, (2012); Ton, Dan T., The U.S. Department of Energy's Microgrid Initiative, Electricity Journal, 25, 8, pp. 84-94, (2012); Hirsch, Adam I., Microgrids: A review of technologies, key drivers, and outstanding issues, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 90, pp. 402-411, (2018); Huang, Jiayi, A review on distributed energy resources and MicroGrid, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 12, 9, pp. 2465-2476, (2008); Shuai, Zhikang, Microgrid stability: Classification and a review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 58, pp. 167-179, (2016); Case Studies of Smart Community Demonstration Project, (2022); Dhundhara, Sandeep, Techno-economic analysis of the lithium-ion and lead-acid battery in microgrid systems, Energy Conversion and Management, 177, pp. 122-142, (2018); Katsanevakis, Markos, Aggregated applications and benefits of energy storage systems with application-specific control methods: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 75, pp. 719-741, (2017); Alhaider, Mohammed M., Mixed integer programming based battery sizing, Energy Systems, 5, 4, pp. 787-805, (2014); Bendotti, Pascale, On the complexity of the Unit Commitment Problem, Annals of Operations Research, 274, 1-2, pp. 119-130, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524847","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142134793"

However, operating systems with high renewable energy penetration remain challenging due to the stochastic nature of these energy sources. To tackle these problems, the authors propose a state machine-based energy management strategy combined with a hysteresis band control strategy for renewable energy hybrid microgrids that integrates hydrogen storage systems. By considering the power difference between the renewable energy source, and the demand, the battery's state of charge, and the hydrogen storage level, the proposed energy management strategy can control the power of fuel cells, electrolyzers, and batteries in a microgrid and the power imported into/exported from the main grid. The results showed that the energy management strategy provides the following advantages: (1) the power supply and demand balance in the microgrid was balanced, (2) the lifespans of the electrolyzer and fuel cell were extended, and (3) the state of charge of the battery and the stored level of the hydrogen were appropriately ensured. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Management Strategy; Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems; Hydrogen Storage System; State Machine Control; Battery Management Systems; Charging (batteries); Economics; Electric Power System Control; Electrolytic Cells; Energy Management Systems; Hydrogen Storage; Renewable Energy Resources; Secondary Batteries; Stochastic Systems; Energy Management Strategy; Energy Systems; Hybrid Renewable Energies; Hybrid Renewable Energy System; Hydrogen Storage System; Machine Controls; Management Strategies; Microgrid; State Machine Control; State-machine; Fuel Cells","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Economics; Electric power system control; Electrolytic cells; Energy management systems; Hydrogen storage; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Energy management strategy; Energy systems; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy system; Hydrogen storage system; Machine controls; Management strategies; Microgrid; State machine control; State-machine; Fuel cells","","","This work was partially supported by Japan Society for the promotion of Science (JSPS) , grant number 19K04325 .","Renewable Capacity Highlights, (2025); undefined, (2022); Vivas Fernández, Francisco José, A review of energy management strategies for renewable hybrid energy systems with hydrogen backup, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 82, pp. 126-155, (2018); Marchenko, O.

The external features, such as irradiance and temperature, are measured by the weather station. However, the irradiance and the temperature measured from measurement instruments are not representative of the energy and the heat that the PV modules receive. The internal factors, such as resistance, are difficult to identify since they are not physically present in the PV modules. One of the trending research directions is to utilize the output characteristics of the PV module to determine the operating conditions of the PV module. This paper presents a method to identify external features (solar irradiance and temperature) and internal resistances by employing the I–V characteristics of the PV module. The proposed method is based on the regression model, which uses the experimental I–V values from the I–V​ tracer.

However, in recent years, urbanisation changed the income structure of residents near mangroves. Different landscapes provide different job opportunities; thus, analysis of regional landscape patterns is important for understanding income structures. In this study, surveys on the income structure and landscape patterns of the surrounding areas of three mangrove sites were conducted in the Hau and Hoang Mai River estuaries in Nghe An Province, North-Central Vietnam. The results reveal that both natural and socio-economic landscape components affected income structure. The major occupations in the study area were agriculture, including husbandry, sea fishing, and trading. Land morphology and river type were the major factors influencing the income from agriculture, while coastline morphology primarily affected income from sea fishing. Community-based trading was carried out in the study area; thus, the population inside each administrative unit was a significant factor increasing income, while the retail market size in an area had significant negative effects, potentially due to the increasing number of competitors. Our study aimed to evaluate mangrove ecosystem importance for local livelihoods in relation to landscape patterns, and the results contribute to urban planning based on the conservation and sustainable use of mangrove ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystem Service; Income Structure; Landscape; Livelihood; Mangrove; Ecosystem Service; Landscape Ecology; Livelihood; Mangrove; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Urban Planning; Urbanization; Viet Nam","ecosystem service; landscape ecology; livelihood; mangrove; spatiotemporal analysis; urban planning; urbanization; Viet Nam","","","This research was supported by a scientific project of the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training, code B2022-TDV-08.

While many previous conventional attempts to measure resilience at the household level have largely employed the “objective” top-down framework relying mostly on a macro observed socioeconomic dataset, this present work seeks to estimate household resilience through an alternative bottom-up method, called the “subjective” resilience approach. With specific reference to the context of two ethnic Pa Cô and Tà Ôi minorities living in upland areas of Central Vietnam, this study aims to (1) measure household resilience to climate change by scoring five livelihood capitals, financial, human, social, physical, and natural, by applying the Household Livelihood Resilience (HLR) framework; and (2) provide an intersectional lens of ethnicity and gender in relation to the household’s livelihood resilience. To achieve these goals, in addition to two focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews, an empirical survey of 236 households was conducted between September to December 2021. Our findings indicated that there are differences in observed livelihood resilience among the ethnic minority groups and, within that, between gender (sex, status) factors. Ethnic women and poor households have a lower resilience than other groups in society due to their lower human capital and limited access to public and financial resources, which are to some degree linked to the difference in the gender division of labor and the cultural norms of patriarch traditions. This study highlights the importance of considering gender and poverty in resilience-building efforts and offers insights for future programs in multi-ethnic developing countries such as Vietnam. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Gender; Livelihood Resilience; Poverty Alleviation; Vietnam; Climate Change; Ethnicity; Gender; Household Energy; Labor Division; Livelihood; Poverty Alleviation; Viet Nam","climate change; ethnicity; gender; household energy; labor division; livelihood; poverty alleviation; Viet Nam","","","This work was financially supported by Hue University under the Core Research Program, Grant No. NCM.DHH.2019.06.","Provisional State of the Global Climate Report 2022; Climate Change 2022 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2022); Dinh, Nguyen Cong, Long-Term Improvement in Precautions for Flood Risk Mitigation: A Case Study in the Low-Lying Area of Central Vietnam, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 12, 2, pp. 250-266, (2021); Nguyen Duc, Kien, Farmers' choices of climate-resilient strategies: Evidence from Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 317, (2021); Nguyen, Yen Thi Bich, Determinants of livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Two minority ethnic communities in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam, Environmental Science and Policy, 123, pp. 11-20, (2021); Phuong, Tran Thi, Livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Indexes and insights from two ethnic minority communities in Central Vietnam, Environmental Challenges, 10, (2023); Sam, Anu Susan, Vulnerabilities to flood hazards among rural households in India, Natural Hazards, 88, 2, pp. 1133-1153, (2017); Zeleke, Getnet, Farmers' livelihood vulnerability to climate-related risks in the North Wello Zone, northern Ethiopia, Environmental and Sustainability Indicators, 17, (2023); Tran, Van Thanh, Nuanced assessment of livelihood resilience through the intersectional lens of gender and ethnicity: Evidence from small-scale farming communities in the upland regions of Vietnam, Journal of Rural Studies, 92, pp. 68-78, (2022); Tanner, Thomas M., Livelihood resilience in the face of climate change, Nature Climate Change, 5, 1, pp. 23-26, (2015)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149276592"

Relative humidity (RH) cycling tests using hydrogen gas and air are conducted on a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell based membrane NRE211 at the open circuit voltage (OCV), 0.05 and 0.3 Acm−2 conditions. The different current density conditions result in different in-plane membrane stresses and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> formation rates during the test. After every 200 RH cycles, membrane integrity is assessed via the hydrogen crossover rate and OCV. Furthermore, catalytic combustion is analyzed during OCV measurement using a thermal imaging method employing high-transmittance glass at the cathode side. The membrane failed after 1600, 1800, and 2200 RH cycles under the OCV condition, 0.05 of 0.3 Acm−2, respectively. The vigorous membrane degradation under OCV conditions can be attributed to higher mechanical stress and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> formation rate. Hotspots created owing to the combustion between the crossover hydrogen and air were successfully captured, with a maximum temperature rise ranging from 15 to 16 °C compared with a given cell temperature of 80 °C.

The reference MSR is a 600 MW (thermal), fast neutron spectrum reactor using a mixture of NaCl–CaCl<inf>2</inf>–UCl<inf>3</inf>–PuCl<inf>3</inf> as fuel. An MSR core was designed with the composition of the fuel and the core geometry based on several references. The reactor physical characteristics were calculated for the core using the ERANOS code system. The results show that the reactor can be critical with a compact size and has high passive safety with negative temperature feedback coefficients. A control rod bundle made of stainless steel without the need for strong neutron absorbers was designed. It is expected that reactor physics experiments are needed for MSR development. To design reactor physics experiments for the MSR, the current research target is to use the existing critical assembly in Japan, KUCA, to its maximum potential. Several configurations are proposed and the representativity factor of the experiments to the MSR was evaluated. The results show that the designed configurations have a relatively low representativity. Therefore, a configuration based on the ZPPR using plutonium fuel and with a large size was designed.

Findings showed that the incorporation of RS displayed superior enhancement in the mechanical properties and water resistance in CDW/RS. The incorporation of CC slightly improved these properties in CDW/CC and RS/CC but offered greater thermal stability, as shown by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG).

Here, for the first time, we propose a monolayer Janus structure with the Mexican-hat band, γ-GeSSe, by replacing the S atoms on one side of the synthesized γ-GeS with Se atoms. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), we show that γ-GeSSe is mechanically, dynamically, and thermally stable. The mechanical, electronic, optical, and transport properties of monolayer Janus γ-GeSSe are also investigated in the DFT calculations. We find that the ideal strengths of the Janus γ-GeSSe are 6.08, 8.6, and 10.08 GPa for the armchair, zigzag, and biaxial directions, respectively. The Janus γ-GeSSe is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.131 eV. Our results show the Janus γ-GeSSe as a photocatalysis material for water splitting with a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 28.78%. This is because the combination of features includes an intrinsic electric field, high optical absorption coefficient, and carrier mobility. In addition, with the γ-structure, the Janus γ-GeSSe shows an intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity of 3.33 W/mK at room temperature, which will contribute to obtaining high TE efficiency. By using the Boltzmann transport theory, we find that the maximum TE power factor and figure of merit of the Janus γ-GeSSe reach 55-85 mW/mK2 and 0.7-0.9 in the temperature range from 300 to 900 K, respectively. Thus, our findings not only contribute to proposing a Janus material but also suggest that it can be used as an energy material with high-performance photocatalysis and TE. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Density Functional Theory; Ideal Strength; Janus Monolayer; Photocatalysis; Thermoelectricity; Density Functional Theory; Electric Fields; Energy Gap; Hydrogen; Light Absorption; Photocatalysis; Solar Power Generation; Statistical Mechanics; Thermal Conductivity; Thermoelectric Equipment; Thermoelectricity; Density-functional-theory; Energy Applications; First Principle Calculations; High Performance Material; Ideal Strength; Janus Monolayer; Mechanically Stable; Synthesised; Thermally Stable; Two-dimensional; Monolayers","Density functional theory; Electric fields; Energy gap; Hydrogen; Light absorption; Photocatalysis; Solar power generation; Statistical mechanics; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Density-functional-theory; Energy applications; First principle calculations; High performance material; Ideal strength; Janus monolayer; Mechanically stable; Synthesised; Thermally stable; Two-dimensional; Monolayers","","","N.T.H. acknowledges JSPS KAKENHI (No. JP20K15178), FRIS Creative Interdisciplinary Collaboration Program in Tohoku University, and financial support from the Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences in Tohoku University.","Fujishima, Akira, Electrochemical photolysis of water at a semiconductor electrode, Nature, 238, 5358, pp. 37-38, (1972); Wang, Zheng, Recent developments in heterogeneous photocatalysts for solar-driven overall water splitting, Chemical Society Reviews, 48, 7, pp. 2109-2125, (2019); Zhuang, Houlong, Computational search for single-layer transition-metal dichalcogenide photocatalysts, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 117, 40, pp. 20440-20445, (2013); Huang, Caijin, Carbon-doped BN nanosheets for metal-free photoredox catalysis, Nature Communications, 6, (2015); Hu, Wei, Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting over Edge-Modified Phosphorene Nanoribbons, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 139, 43, pp. 15429-15436, (2017); Guan, Shan, Tunable ferroelectricity and anisotropic electric transport in monolayer β -GeSe, Physical Review B, 97, 14, (2018); Hicks, L.

In recent years, the increasing trend of digital transformation (DX) across various fields, including protection and automation systems, has led to the promotion of IEC 61850 process bus-based digital substations. However, recent analysis and evaluation have revealed numerous challenges in various aspects, such as technical issues, system performance, test methods, maintenance, and economic considerations. Moreover, many of these challenges lie outside the scope of international standards like IEC 61850 and IEC 61869. As a result, the worldwide implementation of digital substations has been hindered. This paper aims to describe the issues encountered during the implementation of process bus technology and propose solutions that focus on optimizing system configuration based on our experience in implementing digital substation projects and developing MU and IED. Addressing these issues is crucial to fully unlocking the potential of digital substations. One of the most promising advantages is the availability of digital data collected from substation equipment. By utilizing this data, overall power system operational efficiency can be enhanced, and equipment management can be optimized. Predictive maintenance can be implemented, enabling the early detection of potential equipment failures, minimizing unplanned outages, and reducing the need for emergency repairs, which contribute to unnecessary carbon emissions and equipment downtime.

However, the battery will be unstable, leading to failure in the system operation or causing safety accidents when the battery reaches its end-of-life (EOL). Therefore, to accurately predict the State of health (SOH) and the remaining useful life (RUL), a novel prediction method is proposed in this paper based on long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and self-attention mechanism (SM). The degradation data of the batteries are first processed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), then the data is put into the proposed model, and the obtained prediction results are compared with other models for validation. Different batteries from two datasets are utilized in this work to determine the robustness of the method. The errors, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are also calculated to verify the accuracy, and the RMSE and MAE of the proposed method are about 32.6% and 22.7% compared to other methods in all cases, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory; Convolutional Neural Network; Empirical Mode; Self-attention Mechanism; State Of Health; Brain; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Digital Storage; Errors; Forecasting; Long Short-term Memory; Mean Square Error; Attention Mechanisms; Battery Energy Storage Systems; Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory; Convolutional Neural Network; Empirical Mode; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Mean Absolute Error; Root Mean Square Errors; Self-attention Mechanism; State Of Health; Empirical Mode Decomposition","Brain; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Digital storage; Errors; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Attention mechanisms; Battery energy storage systems; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Convolutional neural network; Empirical mode; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Mean absolute error; Root mean square errors; Self-attention mechanism; State of health; Empirical mode decomposition","","","","Hu, Xiaosong, State estimation for advanced battery management: Key challenges and future trends, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 114, (2019); Accid Reconstr J, (2013); Ng, Kongsoon, Enhanced coulomb counting method for estimating state-of-charge and state-of-health of lithium-ion batteries, Applied Energy, 86, 9, pp. 1506-1511, (2009); Birkl, Christoph R., Degradation diagnostics for lithium ion cells, Journal of Power Sources, 341, pp. 373-386, (2017); Lithium Ion Battery State of Charge and Critical Surface Charge Estimation Using an Electrochemical Model Based Extended Kalman Filter, (2010); Shu, Xing, An adaptive multi-state estimation algorithm for lithium-ion batteries incorporating temperature compensation, Energy, 207, (2020); Kim, Jonghoon, Complementary cooperation algorithm based on DEKF combined with pattern recognition for SOC/capacity estimation and SOH prediction, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 27, 1, pp. 436-451, (2012); Severson, Kristen A., Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation, Nature Energy, 4, 5, pp. 383-391, (2019); Yang, Duo, A Neural Network Based State-of-Health Estimation of Lithium-ion Battery in Electric Vehicles, Energy Procedia, 105, pp. 2059-2064, (2017); Ma, Yan, A novel method for state of health estimation of lithium-ion batteries based on improved LSTM and health indicators extraction, Energy, 251, (2022)","Leonowicz, Z.; Stracqualursi, E.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE Asia Meeting on Environment and Electrical Engineering, EEE-AM 2023","","Hanoi","196896","","9798350381061","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184856066"

Handling BSW varies depending on the situation of the waste management system and socioeconomic conditions of each country. This study aims at giving a short review of the current situation of BSW treatment methods in the World. With the high amount of BSW, landfilling and incineration are the most reliable methods for low-and middle-income countries. While in developed nations, BSW accounted for 20-40% of the total waste, making Waste-To-Energy the second-best option besides recycling. With a low efficiency of waste segregation at source, BSW in Vietnam accounted for 55-75% of the total MSW. Landfilling was the main method of handling BSW in Vietnam, with 76%, followed by composting with 16%, and the remaining 13% was sent to incineration plants. Since 2022, the Vietnamese Government has promulgated the Environmental Protection Strategies, with the main target being to increase waste recycling and reduce the waste to landfill to 30% by 2025. To achieve these goals, further study to enhance the application of sustainable methods for BSW treatment must be focused. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradable Solid Waste (bsw); Composting; Incineration; Landfilling; Solid Waste Management; Solid Waste Treatment; Waste-to-energy; Recycling; Waste Incineration; Waste Treatment; Biodegradable Solid Waste; Current Situation; Landfilling; Socio-economic Conditions; Solid Waste Management; Solid Waste Treatment; System Conditions; Viet Nam; Waste Management Systems; Waste To Energy; Municipal Solid Waste","Recycling; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Biodegradable solid waste; Current situation; Landfilling; Socio-economic conditions; Solid waste management; Solid waste treatment; System conditions; Viet Nam; Waste management systems; Waste to energy; Municipal solid waste","","","","What A Waste 2 0 A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050, (2018); Ryu, Changkook, Potential of municipal solid waste for renewable energy production and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in South Korea, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 60, 2, pp. 176-183, (2010); Megacities Urban Form Governance and Sustainability, (2011); Wang, Yaya, Classification and management of kitchen waste: disposals and proposals in Chaoyang district, Beijing, China, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 20, 1, pp. 461-468, (2018); Economic Cost of Out of School Children in Southeast Asia, (2015); Procedia Environ Sci, (2016); Wei, Yunmei, Environmental challenges impeding the composting of biodegradable municipal solid waste: A critical review, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 122, pp. 51-65, (2017); Adhikari, Bijaya K., Home and community composting for on-site treatment of urban organic waste: Perspective for Europe and Canada, Waste Management and Research, 28, 11, pp. 1039-1053, (2010); Iwasaki, Shinya, The effect of organic matter application on carbon sequestration and soil fertility in upland fields of different types of Andosols, Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 63, 2, pp. 200-220, (2017); Kubotera, Hideo, Analysis of problems in certain soils of the Kyushu Okinawa region for suitable management, Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 66, 1, pp. 15-20, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","8th International Scientific Conference on Applying New Technology in Green Buildings, ATiGB 2023","","Danang","195865","","9798350343977","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182732778"

Given the diverse purposes, SHA-3 serves in the IoT landscape, the need for versatility is essential. Additionally, recent studies have primarily focused on achieving high performance and optimizing resource utilization for SHA-3. However, these studies have overlooked the crucial aspect of data transfer between the external memory and the hash function block, as transfer time plays a significant role. This paper proposes an efficient SHA-3 architecture designed for System-on-Chip (SoC) based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) called system-level SHA-3 accelerator (SSA) to address the aforementioned challenges and be suitable for real edge computing. The SSA contains three key proposals. Firstly, the proposed padding architecture is designed from a combination of Serial Input to Parallel Output (SIPO) and a barrel shifter, which is well-suitable for managing the data transfer process on the system. Secondly, implementing a two-stage pipelining within the Round Function (RF) to reduce critical path delays and make a high occupancy. Finally, designing four modes (SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512) enables the SSA to compute various SHA-3 to support a wide range of applications. Our architecture is implemented on the DE10-Standard Development Kit (Cyclone V SX SoC-5CSXFC6D6F31C6N), which is integrated into the FPGA and is controlled by a Dual-Core ARM Cortex-A9 processor. The result is up to 38.34 Gbps in throughput and 5.61 Mbps/ALM in efficiency for the RF computation, 28.02 Gbps in throughput, and 3.63 Mbps/ALM for the full proposed architecture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High Performance Computing; Padding; Round Function; Sha-3 Accelerator; Soc Fpga; Efficiency; Field Programmable Gate Arrays (fpga); Hash Functions; Internet Of Things; Programmable Logic Controllers; System-on-chip; Algorithm-3; Field Programmables; High Performance Computing; Padding; Performance Computing; Programmable Gate Array; Round Functions; Secure Hash Algorithm (); Secure Hash Algorithm-3 Accelerator; System-on-chip Field Programmable Gate Array; Systems-on-chip; Data Transfer","Efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hash functions; Internet of things; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Algorithm-3; Field programmables; High performance computing; Padding; Performance computing; Programmable gate array; Round functions; Secure Hash Algorithm (); Secure hash algorithm-3 accelerator; System-on-chip field programmable gate array; Systems-on-Chip; Data transfer","","","Furthermore, this research has introduced a SoC-based SHA-3 accelerator, resulting in substantial enhancements in data transfer efficiency within the system and the processing rate of SHA-3. Nevertheless, a notable challenge within our architecture lies in the large resource utilization, leading to a low Efficiency Index. As a result, we recognize the signif- icance of devising a novel architecture that addresses these resource constraints while maintaining high performance and flexibility. This endeavor is poised to emerge as a crucial research direction in the near future within this field.

In the literature, various analysis methods were proposed to estimate the penetration of PV, which is proper to install into the distribution networks without negative impacts. This paper presents a statistical approach to calculate the hosting capacity of solar power plants in a practical 35kV distribution network in Vietnam. The uncertainties of PV production and power consumption are also considered to determine the probability of risks to the grid.

It is designed for retail power suppliers holding energy resource aggregator's functions. The calculation framework includes two models of demand response (DR) programs: one is price-based DR, and the other is incentive-based one. For each DR program, the parameters are electricity prices or rebate levels. The authors formulate a power trade between the retail power suppliers and their consumers as a social welfare maximization (SWM) problem. From the viewpoint of SWM, the authors theoretically design the way to set the parameters of the DER management with maximizing the social welfare, while reducing imbalance between power supply and demand. The social welfare is defined as the sum of the retail power suppliers' surplus and the consumers' one in this paper. Through numerical simulations, the authors validate that the calculation framework induces the amount of power consumption to the target value of the DER management and increases the social welfare with reducing the power imbalance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Demand Response Programs; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity Prices; Imbalance Between Power Supply And Demand; Rebate Levels; Social Welfare Maximization; Costs; Economics; Electric Power Systems; Sales; Demand Response Programs; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity Prices; Energy Resource Managements; Imbalance Between Power Supply And Demand; Power; Power Suppliers; Rebate Level; Social Welfare; Social Welfare Maximization; Energy Resources","Costs; Economics; Electric power systems; Sales; Demand response programs; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity prices; Energy resource managements; Imbalance between power supply and demand; Power; Power suppliers; Rebate level; Social welfare; Social welfare maximization; Energy resources","","","","Int J Electr Energy, (2019); Shin Imbalance Ryoukin Seido Setsumeikai Seminar about New Regulation of Imbalance Penalty, (2022); Newcomb, James, Distributed energy resources: Policy implications of decentralization, Electricity Journal, 26, 8, pp. 65-87, (2013); Kerscher, Selina, The key role of aggregators in the energy transition under the latest European regulatory framework, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 134, (2022); Hansen, Timothy M., Heuristic Optimization for an Aggregator-Based Resource Allocation in the Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 6, 4, pp. 1785-1794, (2015); Report to the United States Congress, (2006); Zou, Xiaoyan, Double-sided auction mechanism design in electricity based on maximizing social welfare, Energy Policy, 37, 11, pp. 4231-4239, (2009); Yang, Peng, A game-theoretic approach for optimal time-of-use electricity pricing, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 28, 2, pp. 884-892, (2013); Trans Power Syst, (2018); Takano, Hirotaka, Theoretical Design of Economic Incentive in Demand Response Programs, CIGRE Science and Engineering, 2022, 26, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES); Nagoya University; University of Kurdistan","10th International Conference on Power and Energy Systems Engineering, CPESE 2023","","Nagoya","194265","","9798350327625","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178505252"

These vehicles offer versatile and flexible deployment capabilities, while also addressing environmental issues by reducing carbon emissions and minimizing their overall impact. This paper introduces a new approach to obtain optimal voltage control in the power supply vehicle equipped with a Free Piston Stirling Engine Generator (FPSEG) fueled by wood biomass and solar power, along with a battery. The proposed method employs an Inverse Reference Model-Inverse Linear Quadratic (IRM-ILQ) control technique to ensure stable operation and enhance performance. By utilizing an error model based on the inverse reference model derived from voltage equations, the DC link voltage of the FPSEG is effectively regulated through the inverse reference technique. Additionally, the ILQ design method determines the optimal feedback gain. Optimal control of the DC link voltage minimizes FPSEG losses and achieves maximum efficiency and maximum output operation. The effectiveness of this control method is confirmed through simulation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Voltage Control; Free-piston Stirling Engine Generation; Inverse Linear Quadratic; Inverse Reference Model; Power Supply Vehicle; Electric Generators; Electric Power Systems; Electric Vehicles; Inverse Problems; Solar Energy; Voltage Control; Adaptive Voltage; Adaptive Voltage Control; Engine Generation; Free Piston Stirling Engine; Free-piston Stirling Engine Generation; Inverse Linear Quadratic; Inverse Reference Model; Linear Quadratic; Power Supply; Power Supply Vehicle; Reference Modeling; Stirling Engines","Electric generators; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Inverse problems; Solar energy; Voltage control; Adaptive voltage; Adaptive voltage control; Engine generation; Free piston Stirling engine; Free-piston stirling engine generation; Inverse linear quadratic; Inverse reference model; Linear quadratic; Power supply; Power supply vehicle; Reference modeling; Stirling engines","","","","Natural Disaster Databook 2021 Ananalytical Overview, (2021); Shibaura Institute of Technology Homepage News 2016; Npo Japan Stirling Engine Promotion Association Homepage Se Square no 14; Development of A Power Supply Car that can Supplyelectricity and Hot Water with A Stirling Engine and Solar Panels in Anemergency, (2017); Ahmadou, Ka, ILQ optimal voltage control for biomass free-piston stirling engine generator system, pp. 175-180, (2019); Takami, Hiroshi, Fundamental electrical characteristics and maximum power condition of free piston stirling engine generator with series resonance circuit, IEEJ Transactions on Industry Applications, 136, 8, pp. 557-566, (2016); Solar Energy Conference Cosponsored by ASME Jses, (1987); Ndiaye, Mamadou, Power Supply Vehicle Hybrid Biomass-PV FPSEG Generator System as a Countermeasure against Disaster, pp. 408-411, (2021); Aunal Meeting of Electricalengineering of Japan, (2014); Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers 20th Stirling Cycle Simposium, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Istanbul Nisantasi University; JR-East Group; NTEC; TMEiC","12th IEEE International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications, ICRERA 2023","","Oshawa; ON","193231","","9798350337938","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175615258"

On the other hand, the limitations in the offshore platforms can contribute to the failure in the production system due to sand erosion. The objective of this study is to establish a practical framework of monitoring and a tool for generating Integrity Operating Window (IOW) thresholds, which are used for handling sand production in most safe and effective manner. The ultimate goal is to obtain the highest possible production output from producing wells while minimizing sand erosion related risks to as low as a reasonably practical level. The recommended monitoring measures of sand production, production rate and wall thickness are discussed as a part of sand management system. CFD-based models and mechanistic models are additional tools that can enhance this procedure. Erosion simulations of pipe walls indicated that the cushion tees that have replaced the piping with bends to prevent/reduce erosion rates are also susceptible to significant erosion. Therefore, wall thickness measurements are being conducted at critical locations. A simplified mechanistic model was employed to support developing sand erosion IOW prediction tool and determining monitoring locations, provided that a process for wall thickness measurements at critical locations is in place for verifying and fine tuning the models on regular basis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Erosion; Failure (mechanical); Location; Materials Handling; Offshore Oil Well Production; Offshore Oil Wells; Offshore Technology; Safety Engineering; Sand; Critical Location; Integrity Management; Mechanistic Models; Offshores; Operating Windows; Process Equipments; Process Piping; Sand Erosion; Sand Production; Wall Thickness; Thickness Measurement","Erosion; Failure (mechanical); Location; Materials handling; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore technology; Safety engineering; Sand; Critical location; Integrity management; Mechanistic models; Offshores; Operating windows; Process equipments; Process piping; Sand erosion; Sand production; Wall thickness; Thickness measurement","","","","Recommended Practice for Design and Installation of Offshore Production Platform Piping Systems, (2025); Arabnejad, Hadi, Development of mechanistic erosion equation for solid particles, Wear, 332-333, pp. 1044-1050, (2015); Arabnejad, Hadi, The effect of erodent particle hardness on the erosion of stainless steel, Wear, 332-333, pp. 1098-1103, (2015); Bourgoyne, Adam Ted, Experimental study of erosion in diverter systems due to sand production, pp. 807-18716, (1989); Chen, Xianghui, A comprehensive procedure to estimate erosion in elbows for gas/liquid/sand multiphase flow, Journal of Energy Resources Technology, 128, 1, pp. 70-78, (2006); Edwards, Jeremy K., Supplementing a CFD code with erosion prediction capabilities, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Fluids Engineering Division (Publication) FEDSM, (1998); Dnv Recommended Practice O501 Revision 4 2, (2007); Dnvgl RP O501 Recommended Practice Managing Sand Production and Erosion Det Norske Veritas, (2015); Darihaki, Farzin, Solid particle erosion in gradual contraction geometry for a gas-solid system, Wear, 426-427, pp. 643-651, (2019); Darihaki, Farzin, The near-wall treatment for solid particle erosion calculations with CFD under gas and liquid flow conditions in elbows, Advanced Powder Technology, 32, 5, pp. 1663-1676, (2021)","","Offshore Technology Conference","","2023 Offshore Technology Conference Brasil, OTCB 2023","","Rio de Janeiro","193511","","9781959025023","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175556693"

Operators are faced to increase production of oil and gas, which may cause or worthen sand production, while insuring integrity management of process piping and equipment. As a result of higher than expected sand production in a specific field, a pinhole failure was observed on a 12″ Schedule 160 elbow downstream of a Multiphase flow meter (MPFM) that contained a venturi section that caused a localized increase in flow velocities. State-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based erosion prediction procedure was utilized to determine the root cause of failure and help operators with integrity management of the associated piping systems and equipment. Data used for verification of erosion model included wall thickness losses and sand production data in a separator downstream. Additionally, CFD simulations of erosion rates in 12″ elbows were used for evaluating simplified erosion models that are being used to determine Integrity Operating Window (IOW) of piping that are currently installed downstream of the MPFM. The results in the paper include a comparison of wall thickness measurements and erosion rates of the piping downstream of the MPFM with predicted erosion rates. The CFD predicted erosion pattern and wall thickness losses downstream of the MPFM were comparable with the observed erosion rates. The geometry of MPFM and downstream section was too complicated to model with simplified mechanistic models, but the results of CFD and the mechanistic models were more conservative for isolated elbows downstream where wall thickness data were available with ultrasonic thickness (UT) measurements. The results indicate that simplified mechanistic model of Shirazi, et al. (1995, 2016) was sufficient to support developing sand erosion IOW prediction tool and determining condition monitoring locations, provided that a practical process for wall thickness measurements at critical locations is in place for verifying the outcomes and fine tuning the models on regular and as needed basis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Condition Monitoring; Erosion; Failure (mechanical); Offshore Oil Well Production; Sand; Thickness Gages; Down-stream; Erosion Modeling; Erosion Rates; Integrity Management; Mechanistic Models; Multiphase Flow Meter; Process Equipments; Process Piping; Sand Production; Wall Thickness; Thickness Measurement","Computational fluid dynamics; Condition monitoring; Erosion; Failure (mechanical); Offshore oil well production; Sand; Thickness gages; Down-stream; Erosion modeling; Erosion rates; Integrity management; Mechanistic models; Multiphase flow meter; Process equipments; Process piping; Sand production; Wall thickness; Thickness measurement","","","","Recommended Practice for Design and Installation of Offshore Production Platform Piping Systems, (2025); Arabnejad, Hadi, Development of mechanistic erosion equation for solid particles, Wear, 332-333, pp. 1044-1050, (2015); Arabnejad, Hadi, The effect of erodent particle hardness on the erosion of stainless steel, Wear, 332-333, pp. 1098-1103, (2015); Chen, Xianghui, A comprehensive procedure to estimate erosion in elbows for gas/liquid/sand multiphase flow, Journal of Energy Resources Technology, 128, 1, pp. 70-78, (2006); Dnv Recommended Practice O501 Revision 4 2, (2007); Dnvgl RP O501 Recommended Practice Managing Sand Production and Erosion Det Norske Veritas, (2015); Darihaki, Farzin, Solid particle erosion in gradual contraction geometry for a gas-solid system, Wear, 426-427, pp. 643-651, (2019); Darihaki, Farzin, The near-wall treatment for solid particle erosion calculations with CFD under gas and liquid flow conditions in elbows, Advanced Powder Technology, 32, 5, pp. 1663-1676, (2021); Edwards, Jeremy K., Supplementing a CFD code with erosion prediction capabilities, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Fluids Engineering Division (Publication) FEDSM, (1998); Corrosion 2004, (2004)","","Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","2023 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, ATCE 2023","","San Antonio; TX","193292","26386712","9781555637446; 9781555631482; 9781555636524; 9781613996638; 9781613998595; 9781618392657; 9781613997239; 9781555636395; 9781634398879; 9781555631567","PSAEE","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174507127"

Over-extraction has led to groundwater depletion, causing socio-environmental and economic issues. This study investigates the combined impacts of climate change and urban development on groundwater resources and assesses the resilience of these cities’ groundwater systems that are essential for sustainable management strategies. Employing a model-based approach, the study analyses climate and land use changes, groundwater recharge, levels, and resilience. Three land-use and extraction scenarios—high, medium and low—are examined to evaluate their effects on groundwater. The results suggest that all four Asian cities are expected to be warmer in future. Results predict warmer condi-tions across all cities, with Ho Chi Minh City experiencing the most significant temperature increases. All cities anticipate increased rainfall under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, notably Bangkok. Groundwater recharge is projected to decrease in high urbanisation settings and both RCPs, contrasting with a rise in low to medium urbanisation contexts. Under a high urbanisation scenario, the outskirts of all four Asian cities are resilient to climate change and human development, whereas the centre or urban areas are not resilient. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian Cities; Climate Change; Groundwater Resiliency; Human Development","","","","Funding text 1: We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) for funding the project referenced CRRP2018-01MY-Shrestha.

The LLC resonant converters are the preferred choice to select of DC/DC converter topology for on-board charger (OBC) due to it provides many advantages such as high efficiency, high power density. The DBLLC resonant converter operating with variable frequency and the pulse width-modulated (PWM) control will be applied as an isolated stage (DC/DC converter) of 400V-7.4 kW to improve the power density and efficiency of the whole system. The advantage of operating at the adaptive frequency is that the conduction loss in all devices will be reduced, while the soft switching technique is still achieved over the full load range. Furthermore, the detailed CI characteristic along with losses analysis is presented. The topology is designed for 400 VDC input to 220-380VDC output conversion, in the power range from 3.3 kW to 7.4kW.

To mitigate these problems, PV power generation or solar irradiance forecast is of great importance. In the last decades, myriad forecasting methods have been introduced, yet these approaches do not concentrate on the real-time forecast. This paper proposes deep learning-based real-time solar irradiation monitoring and forecasting system with data collected from sensors before being stored in the database. Two predictive models, namely, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Network - Long Short-term Memory (CNN-LSTM), are constructed for day-ahead solar irradiance forecasting. These predicted results are aggregated employing Linear Least Square (LLS) method into the selected forecast values and updated periodically. The forecasting results show that the selected predicting values improve significantly compared to individual ones. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Forecast Aggregation; Real-time; Solar Irradiance Forecast; Brain; Forecasting; Irradiation; Learning Systems; Least Squares Approximations; Solar Energy; Solar Power Generation; Solar Radiation; Deep Learning; Forecast Aggregation; Forecasting: Applications; Monitoring Applications; Photovoltaic Systems; Real- Time; Renewable Energy Source; Solar Irradiance Forecast; Solar Irradiances; Solar Irradiation; Long Short-term Memory","Brain; Forecasting; Irradiation; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Deep learning; Forecast aggregation; Forecasting: applications; Monitoring applications; Photovoltaic systems; Real- time; Renewable energy source; Solar irradiance forecast; Solar irradiances; Solar irradiation; Long short-term memory","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-001.","Gao, Xin, Multiple Wind Speed Forecast Using Simple Recurrent Unit, IEEE Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC), pp. 1706-1710, (2021); Ahmed, Razin, A review and evaluation of the state-of-the-art in PV solar power forecasting: Techniques and optimization, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 124, (2020); Nguyen, Duc Tuyen, A combination of novel hybrid deep learning model and quantile regression for short-term deterministic and probabilistic PV maximum power forecasting, IET Renewable Power Generation, 17, 4, pp. 794-813, (2023); Voyant, Cyril, Machine learning methods for solar radiation forecasting: A review, Renewable Energy, 105, pp. 569-582, (2017); Pang, Zhihong, Solar radiation prediction using recurrent neural network and artificial neural network: A case study with comparisons, Renewable Energy, 156, pp. 279-289, (2020); Nguyen, Duc Tuyen, Forecasting I-V characteristic of PV modules considering real operating conditions using numerical method and deep learning, pp. 544-549, (2020); Tong, Junlong, Hourly solar irradiance forecasting based on encoder–decoder model using series decomposition and dynamic error compensation, Energy Conversion and Management, 270, (2022); Rodriguez-Gallegos, Carlos David, Novel forecast-based dispatch strategy optimization for PV hybrid systems in real time, Energy, 222, (2021); Hochreiter, Sepp, Long Short-Term Memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Wang, Ke, A hybrid deep learning model with 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention networks for short-term traffic flow prediction, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 583, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th International Conference on Green Energy and Applications, ICGEA 2023","","Singapore","188934","","9781665456098","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161438657"

The design is based on a commercial-scale fast burner reactor called the Super Power Reactor Innovative Small Module (S-PRISM) reactor. To reduce the high DPA values of discharged fuels, the melt-refining process developed in the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) project is adopted in this study. The effects of the melt-refining process on the performance of the RFBB are investigated via five scenarios and compared with a core to which the melt-refining process is not applied: Scenario I, “Homogenization,” occurs without the removal of fission products (FPs) during the melt-refining process; Scenario II, “Homogenization and FP Removal,” occurs with the removal of FPs to a fraction similar to that in the melt-refining process developed in the EBR-II project; Scenario III, “Homogenization, FP Removal, and Make-Up,” is similar to Scenario II but makes up fuel losses with natural uranium; Scenario IV, “With 1% TRU [transuranics] Losses,” is similar to Scenario III but is evaluated with 1% of actinides not recovered; Scenario V, “With 10% TRU Losses,” is similar to Scenario III but is evaluated with 10% of actinides not recovered. The results show that it is neutronically and thermal hydraulically feasible to establish a B&B mode with the rotational fuel-shuffling scheme and by reconditioning the fuel whenever its cladding reaches its proven 200 DPA radiation damage limit. In Scenario V, the core is subcritical due to a large number of actinides not being recovered during the melt-refining process. The cores of the other scenarios are all critical. The cores of scenarios in which FPs are removed during the melt-refining process have higher excess reactivity than that of the core of Scenario I (“Homogenization”) and that of the core to which the melt-refining process is not applied. The numerical analyses also show that in scenarios that include making up fuel losses during melt refining, the core is fed with more natural uranium make-up fuel during operation and thus has lower burnup. Other characteristics, such as power density distributions, neutron flux profiles, and fertile and fissile nuclide density distributions, are all stable during operation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Burnup Performance; Melt-refining Process; Rotational Fuel-shuffling Breed-and-burn Fast Reactor; Rotational Fuel-shuffling Scheme; Actinides; Radiation Damage; Recovery; Refining; Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors; Breed And Burns; Burn Up; Burnup Performance; Displacements Per Atoms; Melt-refining Process; Natural Uranium; Performance; Refining Process; Rotational Fuel-shuffling Breed-and-burn Fast Reactor; Rotational Fuel-shuffling Scheme; Fission Products","Actinides; Radiation damage; Recovery; Refining; Sodium-cooled fast reactors; Breed and burns; Burn up; Burnup performance; Displacements per atoms; Melt-refining process; Natural uranium; Performance; Refining process; Rotational fuel-shuffling breed-and-burn fast reactor; Rotational fuel-shuffling scheme; Fission products","","","This work was supported by the National University of Mongolia under grant number P2022-4374; and by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development under grant number 103.04-2020.06.","undefined, (2020); Rec of Proc Session B 10 Icpuae, (1958); undefined, (2020); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, A new reactor burnup concept “candle”, (2000); Gilleland, John, Novel reactor designs to burn non-fissile fuels, 4, pp. 2278-2284, (2008); Proc Int Conf Fast Reactors and Related Fuel Cycles Next Generation Nuclear Systems for Sustainable Development Fr17, (2017); Kuwagaki, Kazuki, Concept of Stationary Wave Reactor with Rotational Fuel Shuffling, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 191, 2, pp. 178-186, (2018); Hoang, Van Khanh, Feasibility of Sodium-Cooled Breed-and-Burn Reactor with Rotational Fuel Shuffling, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 196, 1, pp. 109-120, (2022); Proceedings of ICONE 8 8th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, (2000); Leggett, Robert D., Status of LMR fuel development in the United States of America, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 204, C, pp. 23-32, (1993)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","00295639; 1943748X","","NSENA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147260011"

The IPMSM, whose stator and rotor are composed of non-oriented electrical steel, is investigated. First, the motor is driven by a three-phase inverter with the pulse width modulation (PWM) excitation method and then with the three-phase sinusoidal excitation technique at a rotational speed of 1500 rpm in each condition. The calculation procedure of the stator core loss of the IPMSM is improved from our previous method. The finite element method (FEM) is used to support the identification and computation of motor iron losses, where the PWM carrier frequency is 10 kHz. In addition, experimental results of the extended building factor diagrams for the ring and IPMSM cores under the sinusoidal and inverter excitations are shown and discussed. The main objectives of this study are to investigate and clarify the reasons for increasing the IPMSM stator core loss density owing to the effects of the core shapes and two excitation methods, as well as to thoroughly identify the dominant impact between the core shape and excitation method on the increase in the iron loss density. Furthermore, based on the extended building factor, particular values of the IPMSM stator and rotor core losses in the experiment can be relatively separated and determined. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conceptual Diagrams; Extended Building Factor; Inverter Excitation; Ipmsm Core; Iron Loss Density; Sinusoidal Excitation; Buildings; Electric Inverters; Graphic Methods; Iron; Magnetic Cores; Permanent Magnets; Silicon Steel; Stators; Conceptual Diagrams; Core Loss; Extended Building Factor; Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronoi Motor Core; Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Inverte Excitation; Iron Loss; Iron Loss Density; Sinusoidal Excitations; Stator Core; Pulse Width Modulation","Buildings; Electric inverters; Graphic methods; Iron; Magnetic cores; Permanent magnets; Silicon steel; Stators; Conceptual diagrams; Core loss; Extended building factor; Interior permanent magnet synchronoi motor core; Interior permanent magnet synchronous motor; Inverte excitation; Iron loss; Iron loss density; Sinusoidal excitations; Stator core; Pulse width modulation","","","In future work, the effective value of the magnetic flux density will be used for calculating the weighted average iron loss density.

A newer RegCM4.7 model was used for this exercise. For the simulations over Peninsular Malaysia, analysis shows that these simulations have much smaller precipitation biases. They can correctly predict the annual precipitation cycle over the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia compared to the 25 km simulations. The ensemble of these . 5 km simulations indicates that Peninsular Malaysia is expected to experience a decrease in its seasonal mean precipitation, regardless of the RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5 scenarios. Aside from the reduction of seasonal mean precipitation, consecutive dry and wet days are expected to increase and decrease, respectively. This indicates that Peninsular Malaysia will experience a long dry spell in the future. At the same time, it is suggested that Peninsular Malaysia will have fewer days with very heavy precipitation. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that the 5 km downscaled climate simulations improve significantly over 25 km and that the Peninsular Malaysia region can expect a drier future climate and extremes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cmip5; Cordex-sea; Downscaling; Peninsular Malaysia; Precipitation; Southeast Asia","","","","This research is funded by the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (CRRP2016-02MY-Santisirisomboon) with additional support from the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) Malaysia under the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS1/2020/UKM/01/6/1), the High-defini-tion Clean Energy, Climate, and Weather Forecasts for the Philippines project, and the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) Grant (105.06-2021.14).","Ayoub, Afiqah Bahirah, Evaluation of gridded precipitation datasets in Malaysia, Remote Sensing, 12, 4, (2020); Choi, Gwangyong, Changes in means and extreme events of temperature and precipitation in the Asia-Pacific Network region, 1955-2007, International Journal of Climatology, 29, 13, pp. 1906-1925, (2009); Chung, Jing Xiang, Performances of BATS and CLM land-surface schemes in RegCM4 in simulating precipitation over CORDEX Southeast Asia domain, International Journal of Climatology, 38, 2, pp. 794-810, (2018); Coppola, Erika, Non-Hydrostatic RegCM4 (RegCM4-NH): Model description and case studies over multiple domains, Geoscientific Model Development, 14, 12, pp. 7705-7723, (2021); Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme Bats Version 1e as Coupled to the Ncar Community Climate Model, (1993); Donat, Markus G., Updated analyses of temperature and precipitation extreme indices since the beginning of the twentieth century: The HadEX2 dataset, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 118, 5, pp. 2098-2118, (2013); Emanuel, Kerry A., Development and evaluation of a convection scheme for use in climate models, Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 56, 11, pp. 1766-1782, (1999); Funk, Chris C., The climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations - A new environmental record for monitoring extremes, Scientific Data, 2, (2015); Giorgi, Filippo, Thirty Years of Regional Climate Modeling: Where Are We and Where Are We Going next?, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 124, 11, pp. 5696-5723, (2019); Hewitson, Bruce C., Consensus between GCM climate change projections with empirical downscaling: Precipitation downscaling over South Africa, International Journal of Climatology, 26, 10, pp. 1315-1337, (2006)","","Asia-pacific Network for Global Change Research","","","","","","25227971","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000135316"

Contributing toward a sustainable and zero waste future, DR was utilized as raw material for cellulose and activated carbon production. A chemical delignification method was adopted to valorize DR into cellulose, while carbonization and subsequent KOH activation steps were used to convert the DR into activated carbon. The resulting materials exhibited high adsorption capacity toward Cr6+ (154.2 and 223.3 mg/g for cellulose and activated carbon, respectively). The activated carbon derived from DR exhibited a faster adsorption rate of Cr6+ compared to cellulose and raw DR. The adsorption of Cr6+ by DR-derived adsorbents exhibited a monolayer tendency, with isotherm and kinetics data following the Khan and pseudo-second-order models. The total production cost of converting DR into cellulose and activated carbon was evaluated using life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA).

The length deflector is 0.09 times the length of the slant. The deflector was fixed at the leading edge of the slant with an upward angle of 5° to the horizontal axis. Force, pressure, and global skin-friction measurements were conducted to understand the relation between drag, pressure distribution, and flow fields on the slant surface. The results showed that the deflector reduces aerodynamic drag at low yaw angles. This result is due to the breakdown structure of longitudinal vortexes and the separation bubble, which leads to fully separated flow on the leading edge of the slant. However, at yaw angles above 8°, a large reversed flow region forms on the slant and the drag of the model increases. A similar flow structure on the slant is observed for yaw angles of 12° and 15°. Conversely, the model lift is reduced with the deflector at all yaw angles tested. Detailed pressure distribution and complex flow structure on the slant provide insight in this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahmed Body; Longitudinal Vortex; Separation Bubble; Surface Flow; Yaw Angle; Aerodynamic Drag; Flow Structure; Reynolds Number; Vortex Flow; Ahmed Body; Ahmed Models; Condition; Flow Behaviours; Flow Drag; Longitudinal Vortices; On Flow; Separation Bubble; Surface Flow; Yaw Angles; Pressure Distribution","Aerodynamic drag; Flow structure; Reynolds number; Vortex flow; Ahmed body; Ahmed models; Condition; Flow behaviours; Flow drag; Longitudinal vortices; On flow; Separation bubble; Surface flow; Yaw angles; Pressure distribution","","","Part of this study was supported by the JSPS KAKEN Grant Number JP 21F21347 and the Collaborative Research Program of the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics, Kyushu University .","SAE Trans, (1984); 50th Fluid Dynamics Conference of Jsass, (2018); Bello-Millán, Francisco Javier, Experimental study on Ahmed's body drag coefficient for different yaw angles, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 157, pp. 140-144, (2016); Bonnavion, Guillaume, On multistabilities of real car's wake, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 164, pp. 22-33, (2017); Cheng, See Yuan, Experimental study of yaw angle effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of a road vehicle fitted with a rear spoiler, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 184, pp. 305-312, (2019); Choi, Haecheon, Aerodynamics of heavy vehicles, Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 46, pp. 441-468, (2014); Fourrié, Grégoire, Wall shear stress characterization of a 3D bluff-body separated flow, Journal of Fluids and Structures, 42, pp. 55-69, (2013); Fourrié, Grégoire, Bluff-body drag reduction using a deflector, Experiments in Fluids, 50, 2, pp. 385-395, (2011); Wang, Hangfeng, Aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body based on deflectors, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 148, pp. 34-44, (2016); Effect of Backlight Aspect Ratio on Vortex and Base Drag for A Simple Car Like Shape, (2008)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01676105","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142748440"

This paper presents an assessment of the technical viability of an ultra-small gasification system that utilizes densified carbonized wood pellets/briquettes. The setup was run continuously for 100 h. A variety of biomass was densified and carbonized by harnessing fugitive heat sources before charging into the reactor. Carbonized briquettes and furnished blends exhibited inferior gasification performance compared to the carbonized pellets. In the absence of tar blockage problems, steady-state conditions were achieved when pre-treated feedstock was used. Under steady-state conditions for carbonized pellets gasification operated at an equivalence ratio of 0.32, cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion achieved 49.2% and 70.5%, respectively. Overall efficiency and maximum power output of 20.3% and 21 kW were realised, respectively. It was found that the system could keep stable while the low heating valve of syngas was over 4 MJ/m3 on condition that avoiding tar blocking issues. The results indicate that the proposed compact ultra-small power generation system is a technically feasible approach to remedy power shortage challenge. In addition, process simulation considering carbonized wood gasification combined power generation was formulated to produce syngas and electricity. Woody pellets with the flow rate of 20 kg/h could generate a 15.18 kW power at the air flow rate of 40 Nm3/h, which is in a good agreement with 15 kW in the 100 h operation. It is indicated that the gasification combined power generation cycle simulated by Aspen simulator could achieve reliable data to assist the complicated experiment operation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbonized Briquette; Carbonized Pellet; Densification; Gasification; Small-scale Power Generation; Biomass; Briquets; Efficiency; Gasification; Synthesis Gas; Tar; Carbonized Briquette; Carbonized Pellet; Carbonized Woods; Densifications; Mobile Power Generation; Power Generation Systems; Small Scale Power Generation; Steady-state Condition; Syn Gas; Ultra-small; Pelletizing; Biomass; Chemical Reaction; Efficiency Measurement; Electricity; Experimental Study; Heating; Power Generation; Simulation; Simulator","Biomass; Briquets; Efficiency; Gasification; Synthesis gas; Tar; Carbonized briquette; Carbonized pellet; Carbonized woods; Densifications; Mobile power generation; Power generation systems; Small scale power generation; Steady-state condition; Syn gas; Ultra-small; Pelletizing; biomass; chemical reaction; efficiency measurement; electricity; experimental study; heating; power generation; simulation; simulator","","","The authors thank for the project of the National Key Research and development (R&D) Program and International Science and Technology Innovation Project between Governments (2021YFE0108900) and Pujiang Talent Program Supported by Fund of Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (project code: 20PJ1402800).

This study uses the ɛ-constraint method along with a developed version of the coyote optimization algorithm to achieve the best values of the component sized to decrease the loss of load probability, CO<inf>2</inf> emission value, and the annualized cost of the system. Sensitivity analysis also is performed to show each component's impact on the system. The results demonstrate that the DG backup system improves the yearly cost of the system from 8347.2 $ to 9318.4 $, which shows about 10.42% increasing by increasing the fuel consumption. Here, the LLP increases from 0% to 9.19% and the CO2 emissions improve from 2531.2 kg/yr to 13257 kg/yr. Accordingly, the COE value is reduced from 0.39 $/kWh to 0.24 $/kWh over the PV penetration, reducing from 92.27% to 59.42%. This decreasing indicates that the system fuel cost has more impact than the cost of PV on the COE, which is due to the low cost required of conventional power production than the PV system. The results also indicate a noteworthy upshot on the battery storage unit size such that the size of ɛ<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> has been enhanced from 27.4 kWh to 50 kWh in the range from 7000 kg/year to 25 kg/year.

In Vietnam, where plans to rapidly scale-up electricity generation are among the fastest globally, one question of interest is what would motivate people to pay more for electricity generated by renewable energy sources? As part of its national Power Development Plan, Vietnam targets a future electricity mix consisting of at least 21% renewable energy by 2030. This study assesses the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for increasing renewable energy share and corresponding motivating factors in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Drawing from a valid sample of 294 households, this study uses a double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method (CVM) to evaluate the public perception of renewable energy. On average, respondents are willing to pay about $4.39 USD more on their monthly electric bill to support renewable energy, which represents a 9.48% increase. Notably, respondents most concerned with air quality and the utility's profitability indicated their support to pay more for renewable energy. This study suggests the importance of communicating health-related air pollution mitigation benefits for emerging economies and building support among customers so that electric utilities can increase renewable energy targets. From a policy perspective, improved and transparent disclosure of air pollution data and utility financial statements could expedite the transition to renewable energy in emerging economies, such as Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contingent Valuation Method; Public Perception; Renewable Energy; Vietnam; Willingness To Pay; Air Quality; Competition; Electric Power Generation; Electric Utilities; Contingent Valuation Methods; Emerging Economies; Public Acceptance; Public Perception; Public Support; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Policy; Renewable Energy Technologies; Viet Nam; Willingness To Pay; Renewable Energy Resources","Air quality; Competition; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Contingent valuation methods; Emerging economies; Public acceptance; Public perception; Public support; Renewable energies; Renewable energy policy; Renewable energy technologies; Viet Nam; Willingness to pay; Renewable energy resources","","","The authors would like to thank the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) for making this study possible.

This work presents a deep learning approach to predicting the annual output energy harvested by the 2-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, thereby optimizing the tandem structure design. The data set for training and validating an artificial neural network (ANN) is the Atlas-simulated results of the tandem cell with the various perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness under the real-world conditions composed of the solar spectrum, incident spectral angle, and solar module temperature in a particular month of a year for a specific direction. Consequently, we reveal the significant influence of solar spectral shape on the ANN performance. The proposed ANN model has a mean square error of 1.26 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99979. Based on the spectral and environmental database in Gifu (Japan) in 2015, we predict that the optimal perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness are 1.72 eV and 680 nm for the east, south, and west facades, 1.73 eV and 700 nm for the rooftop, respectively. Consequently, the highest annual output energy obtained is 282.54, 105.07, 174.71, and 90.79 kWh/m2 for the rooftop, the east, south, and west facades, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Actual Spectrum; Artificial Intelligence; Atlas Simulation; Incident Angle; Silicon; Tandem Cell; Deep Learning; Energy Gap; Forecasting; Mean Square Error; Multilayer Neural Networks; Perovskite Solar Cells; Silicon; Solar Panels; Solar Power Generation; Actual Spectrum; Annual Output; Atlas Simulations; Building Integrated Photovoltaic; Incident Angles; Output Energy; Perovskite Layers; Spectra's; Tandem Cells; Tandem Solar Cells; Perovskite","Deep learning; Energy gap; Forecasting; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Perovskite solar cells; Silicon; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Actual spectrum; Annual output; ATLAS simulations; Building integrated photovoltaic; Incident angles; Output energy; Perovskite layers; Spectra's; Tandem cells; Tandem solar cells; Perovskite","","","Collecting the input database for the ANN-based prediction was performed in Gifu prefecture (the latitude of 35.42°N, the longitude of 136.76°E), Japan in a daytime range from 6 to 18 o’clock with a time interval of one hour in 2015.

In this process, bulk MoS<inf>2</inf>and graphite foil served as the sources of MoS<inf>2</inf>and graphene nanosheets, respectively, while glucose and thiourea served as the source of NSCD. The sturdy integration of 0D NSCD and 2D MoS<inf>2</inf>/G in a well-constructed ternary composite provided a huge number of edge active sites with tunable and extraordinary physicochemical properties for electron transport, facilitating HER performance. The optimal NSCD@MoS<inf>2</inf>/G exhibited a superior catalytic activity toward HER with a low onset potential (37 mV), an overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and a Tafel slope as small as 53 mV dec-1, which were better than other 2D electrocatalysts. The increase in double-layer capacitance for NSCD@MoS<inf>2</inf>/G (12.2 mF cm-2), which was 2-fold of the MoS<inf>2</inf>/G sample, is strong evidence of the large catalytic edge sites and electrical coupling in the NSCD@MoS<inf>2</inf>/G ternary system. Moreover, the strong bonding and interaction between NSCD and MoS<inf>2</inf>/G nanosheets enabled outstanding long-term stability and structural integrity, displaying 95 and 90% activity retention at 10 and 50 mA cm-2after 48 h i-t test, respectively.

Many studies have focused on solving the energy management problem for microgrids integrating RES. To address the intermittency caused by RES, flexible components such as battery energy storage systems (BESS) or demand response (DR) are considered. To clarify the problem of integrating these flexible components, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach for the unit commitment (UC) problem for microgrids with BESS and DR is proposed in this paper. An incentive-based demand response model as a negative power source and a detailed model for the vanadium redox battery (VRB) are introduced to improve the efficiency and reliability of microgrids. The objective optimization function, including the costs of generation, emissions, and maintenance, is minimized considering the uncertainty of the load and renewable energy sources. The obtained simulation results are compared with the genetic algorithm (GA) method as the basis for verification in different case studies. The obtained results have clarified the effect of using the BESS model and DR program on system operation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battery Energy Storage System; Demand Response; Renewable Energy; Unit Commitment; Battery Storage; Genetic Algorithms; Integer Programming; Secondary Batteries; Battery Energy Storage Systems; Demand Response; Flexible Components; Incentive-based Demand Response; Microgrid; Mixed-integer Programming; Renewable Energies; Response Energy; System Response; Unit Commitment; Renewable Energy Resources","Battery storage; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Demand response; Flexible components; Incentive-based demand response; Microgrid; Mixed-Integer Programming; Renewable energies; Response energy; System response; Unit Commitment; Renewable energy resources","","","This research is funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI Grant Number 19K04325).","Cagnano, Alessia, Microgrids: Overview and guidelines for practical implementations and operation, Applied Energy, 258, (2020); Assessment of Demand Response and Advanced Metering, (2006); Albadi, Mohammed H., Demand response in electricity markets: An overview, (2007); Haider, Tarish Haider, A review of residential demand response of smart grid, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 59, pp. 166-178, (2016); Honarmand, Mohammad Esmaeil, An Overview of Demand Response: From its Origins to the Smart Energy Community, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 96851-96876, (2021); Tang, Yongwei, Incentive payment design for electricity demand response, (2011); Huang, Chao, Demand Response for Industrial Micro-Grid Considering Photovoltaic Power Uncertainty and Battery Operational Cost, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 12, 4, pp. 3043-3055, (2021); Wang, Beibei, Chance constrained unit commitment considering comprehensive modelling of demand response resources, IET Renewable Power Generation, 11, 4, pp. 490-500, (2017); Wang, Zhanle, Stochastic Optimization for Residential Demand Response with Unit Commitment and Time of Use, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 57, 2, pp. 1767-1778, (2021); Tumuluru, Vamsi Krishna, A two-stage approach for network constrained unit commitment problem with demand response, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 9, 2, pp. 1175-1183, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139933005"

Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed to gain insight into factors driving household rehabilitation. The findings accentuated improvements in women's post-flood resilience as a result of effective interventions from communities, authorities and NGOs. Diversifying livelihoods into the non-agricultural sector was also an important factor to shorten the rehabilitation processes. Additionally, the results emphasized the efficacy of social interactions, notably between relatives and informal groups, after floods. The potential negative consequences of reliance on government support in household rehabilitation efforts are also preliminarily discussed.

We show that in the case of the superlattice graphene Brillouin zone (SBZ) center folded into the primitive graphene Brillouin zone (GBZ) corner, the emergence of different replica Dirac cones and their scattering behaviors are driven by the substrate-induced potential or atomic-scale disorders as well as by the correlation between the rotation angle of the superlattice and the trigonal warping orientation of the Dirac cone because of the quantum interference associated with the scattering at the SBZ edge. In particular, a superlattice with a rotational angle of φ = 30° (G-N√3 × N√3-R30°, N > 1) facilitates intervalley scattering, whereas an unrotated superlattice (G-N3 × N3) is favorable to intravalley scattering. For a superlattice with a rotational angle in the range of 0 < φ < 30°, the intervalley and intravalley scatterings may be comparable to each other, leading to the emergence of mixed inequivalent replica cones at the SBZ center (or GBZ corner). Interestingly, such inequivalent replica cones facilitate a stronger intervalley scattering at the GBZ corner, compared to the G-N√3 × N√3-R30° and G-N3 × N3 superlattices, thus opening a larger energy gap at the primitive Dirac point.

These soils cannot be reused directly cause of its weakness in strength properties. Hence, this study focuses on improving mechanical properties of waste soil by using cement and corn husk fiber. The environment has also benefited from using corn husk fiber since corn husk is agricultural by-product. In order to evaluate the impact of corn husk fiber and cement on mechanical characteristics of waste soil, a series of laboratory experiments containing tension and compression test is carried out. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test is conducted to investigate interaction between fibers and soil-cement matrix. Fiber content from 0 to 1% by dry soil mass and corn husk lengths of 10 and 30 mm are used in this research. The results present that strength properties of cemented soil are enhanced when fiber is added. The most improvements corresponding to compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and direct tensile strength are 30.6%, 206.1%, and 27.9%, respectively. A strong interaction between fibers and soil-cement matrix observed from SEM results in the improvement of strength properties of cemented soil. Fiber inclusion contributes to the more ductile and durable behavior under loading. Fiber length and fiber content have a remarkable effect on the cemented soil behavior. The increase in fiber length and content leads to the increase in residual stress and the decrease in loss of post-peak stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compressive Strength; Corn Husk Fiber; Direct Tensile Strength; Fiber-cement-stabilized Soil; Soil Improvement; Agricultural Wastes; Compression Testing; Fibers; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Soil Cement; Soil Testing; Soils; Tensile Strength; Cement-stabilized Soils; Corn Husk Fiber; Corn Husks; Direct Tensile Strengths; Fiber Cements; Fiber-cement-stabilized Soil; Fibers Content; Soils Improvement; Strength Property; Waste Soils; Compressive Strength","Agricultural wastes; Compression testing; Fibers; Scanning electron microscopy; Soil cement; Soil testing; Soils; Tensile strength; Cement-stabilized soils; Corn husk fiber; Corn husks; Direct tensile strengths; Fiber cements; Fiber-cement-stabilized soil; Fibers content; Soils improvement; Strength property; Waste soils; Compressive strength","","","The authors would like to thank Hiroshi Takahashi Laboratory and Hideyuki Takahashi Laboratory, Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Tohoku University to help and support this research.

This requires that teacher education institutes reorient and redefine their outcome standards as well as redesign their training programs accordingly to incorporate and implement Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Although many efforts have been made to promote ESD in teacher training, little information is available regarding to what extent ESD is integrated in teacher training programs or curricula. This study examines how ESD is incorporated in teacher training programs in terms of learning content, learning outcomes and didactic approach, through analyzing 429 course syllabi offered by the Hanoi National University of Education (HNUE) in Vietnam. HNUE training programs were found to contain some elements of ESD but they lack coherence or systematic inclusion. The results suggest needed strategic changes at organizational (university) and individual (instructor) levels to improve ESD in teacher education. This paper contributes to the discussion on the implementation of a holistic curricular assessment approach for three aspects of ESD (learning content, learning outcomes and didactic approach) and highlights the ongoing need for improving curricular assessment strategies for sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Curriculum Assessment; Education For Sustainable Development (esd); Higher Education; Teacher Education; Curricula; Electrostatic Devices; Personnel Training; Planning; Teaching; Curriculum Assessment; Education For Sustainable Development; High Educations; Learning Contents; Learning Outcome; Teacher Education; Teacher Training; Teachers Training Programs; Training Program; Sustainable Development","Curricula; Electrostatic devices; Personnel training; Planning; Teaching; Curriculum assessment; Education for sustainable development; High educations; Learning contents; Learning outcome; Teacher education; Teacher training; Teachers training programs; Training program; Sustainable development","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 503.01-2020.302 .","Albareda-Tiana, Sílvia, Implementing the sustainable development goals at University level, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 19, 3, pp. 473-497, (2018); Albareda-Tiana, Sílvia, Holistic approaches to develop sustainability and research competencies in pre-service teacher training, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 10, (2018); Implementing Sustainability in Higher Education Learning in an Age of Transformation, (2015); Barth, Matthias, Academic staff development as a catalyst for curriculum change towards education for sustainable development: An output perspective, Journal of Cleaner Production, 26, pp. 28-36, (2012); Barth, Matthias, Synthesising case-study research - ready for the next step?, Environmental Education Research, 18, 6, pp. 751-764, (2012); Comp A J Comp Int Educ, (2021); Boyd, Peter J., Becoming a university lecturer in teacher education: Expert school teachers reconstructing their pedagogy and identity, Professional Development in Education, 36, 1-2, pp. 9-24, (2010); Brandt, Jan Ole, Becoming a competent teacher in education for sustainable development: Learning outcomes and processes in teacher education, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 20, 4, pp. 630-653, (2019); Brundiers, Katja, Key competencies in sustainability in higher education—toward an agreed-upon reference framework, Sustainability Science, 16, 1, pp. 13-29, (2021); Bürgener, Lina, Sustainability competencies in teacher education: Making teacher education count in everyday school practice, Journal of Cleaner Production, 174, pp. 821-826, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132532259"

In this paper, a PV array reconfiguration method is developed to minimize power losses of PV arrays under partial shading conditions. The proposed reconfiguration method is based on equalizing the reduction of the short-circuit current of the PV modules in the PV array. Eight state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network models are employed to estimate the effect of shading on the short-circuit current of a PV module. These models include LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG 11, VGG 19, Inception V3, ResNet 18, ResNet 34, and ResNet 50. Among eight models, the VGG 19 achieves the best accuracy on 1842 sample images. Therefore, this model is used to estimate the ratio of the actual short-circuit current and the estimated short-circuit current in four studied shading scenarios. This ratio decides the switching rule between PV modules throughout the PV array under PSC. A (Formula presented.) experimental PV array shows that the proposed reconfiguration method improves the output power from 5.81% to 25.19% in four shading patterns. Accordingly, the power losses are reduced from 1.32% to 13.75%. The power improvement and the reduction of power losses of the proposed dynamic PV array reconfiguration system under four case studies demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing the effects of PSC on the PV array. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; Dynamic Photovoltaic Array Reconfiguration; Experimental Analysis; Image Processing; Partial Shading Conditions; Convolution; Image Processing; Open Circuit Voltage; Photovoltaic Effects; Solar Panels; Timing Circuits; Condition; Convolutional Neural Network; Dynamic Photovoltaic Array Reconfiguration; Experimental Analysis; Images Processing; Partial Shading; Partial Shading Condition; Photovoltaic Arrays; Powerloss; Short-circuit Currents; Short Circuit Currents","Convolution; Image processing; Open circuit voltage; Photovoltaic effects; Solar panels; Timing circuits; Condition; Convolutional neural network; Dynamic photovoltaic array reconfiguration; Experimental analysis; Images processing; Partial shading; Partial shading condition; Photovoltaic arrays; Powerloss; Short-circuit currents; Short circuit currents","","","This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2020-SAHEP-005.","Snapshot of Global Pv Markets 2020, (2020); Shmilovitz, Doron, Distributed maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic systems-emerging architectures and control methods, Automatika, 53, 2, pp. 142-155, (2012); Malathy, S., Performance enhancement of partially shaded solar photovoltaic array using grouping technique, Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, 137, 3, (2015); Yang, Bo, PV arrays reconfiguration for partial shading mitigation: Recent advances, challenges and perspectives, Energy Conversion and Management, 247, (2021); Chavan, Vinaya Chandrakant, Effect of PV Array Positioning on Mismatch and Wiring Losses in Static Array Reconfiguration, IETE Journal of Research, 69, 7, pp. 4676-4689, (2023); Chavan, Vinaya Chandrakant, Hardware Implementation of Novel Shade Dispersion PV Reconfiguration Technique to Enhance Maximum Power under Partial Shading Conditions, Energies, 15, 10, (2022); Sai Krishna, Gundluru, Optimal SuDoKu Reconfiguration Technique for Total-Cross-Tied PV Array to Increase Power Output under Non-Uniform Irradiance, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 34, 4, pp. 1973-1984, (2019); Yadav, Karan Shishir, Mitigation of Mismatch Power Losses of PV Array under Partial Shading Condition using novel Odd Even Configuration, Energy Reports, 6, pp. 427-437, (2020); Mishra, Neha, Performance enhancement of PV system using proposed array topologies under various shadow patterns, Solar Energy, 157, pp. 641-656, (2017); Anjum, Shahroz, Modelling and simulation of AdDoKu based reconfiguration technique to harvest maximum power from photovoltaic array under partial shading conditions, Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 115, (2022)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137800689"

Face-to-face interview methods were used to investigate the current status of construction and demolition waste (CDW) management (collection, transportation, treatment, and storage) as well as reveal attitudes of governmental agencies and enterprises towards CDW recycling and recycled material products in Hai Phong City, Vietnam. Waste generation rates (WGRs) of the works were also determined by site surveys and as-built drawings method of typical old buildings to be demolished and two licensed new construction works. WGRs of 34.5 kg/m2 and 758 kg/m2 were identified during the construction and demolition of small private houses, respectively, while WGRs at public house demolition sites were 1053 kg/m2. To effectively manage the CDW, the gross floor area of new construction work was estimated by a multiple regression equation with the population and gross region domestic product growth. Based on this model combining the investigation results, the amount of CDW increase in 5–30 years is also predicted. This data set will help management agencies plan storage yards as well as select the appropriate CDW treatment and recycling methods, contributing to building a sustainable and effective CDW management model for Hai Phong City as well as Vietnam in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cdw Dumping Site; Construction And Demolition Waste (cdw); Hai Phong City; Projection Of Cdw Generation; Waste Generation Rate (wgr); Multiple Regression; Hai Phong; Viet Nam","multiple regression; Hai Phong; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by Japan Science and Technology Agency- JST and Japan International Cooperation Agency- JICA through the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) program, grant number No. JPMJSA1701.","Qiao, Liang, Generation and prediction of construction and demolitionwaste using exponential smoothing method: A case study of Shandong Province, China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 12, (2020); Wu, Zezhou, Quantifying construction and demolition waste: An analytical review, Waste Management, 34, 9, pp. 1683-1692, (2014); People S Republic of China Construction and Demolition Waste Management and Recycling, (2018); Wu, Huanyu, Status quo and future directions of construction and demolition waste research: A critical review, Journal of Cleaner Production, 240, (2019); Iodice, Silvia, Sustainability assessment of Construction and Demolition Waste management applied to an Italian case, Waste Management, 128, pp. 83-98, (2021); Rondinel-Oviedo, Daniel R., Construction and demolition waste management in developing countries: a diagnosis from 265 construction sites in the Lima Metropolitan Area, International Journal of Construction Management, 23, 2, pp. 371-382, (2023); Zhao, Xianbo, Construction and demolition waste management in Australia: A mini-review, Waste Management and Research, 40, 1, pp. 34-46, (2022); Llatas, C., A model for quantifying construction waste in projects according to the European waste list, Waste Management, 31, 6, pp. 1261-1276, (2011); Majlessi, Monireh, Generation rates and current management of municipal, construction and demolition wastes in Tehran, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 21, 1, pp. 191-200, (2019); Hoang, Ngoc Han, Waste generation, composition, and handling in building-related construction and demolition in Hanoi, Vietnam, Waste Management, 117, pp. 32-41, (2020)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136970694"

The power grid must be stable to ensure the efficiency and dependability of electrical equipment. This implies that the high-voltage equipment at the substation must be reliably operated. As a result, the appropriate and dependable use of systems to monitor the operating status of high-voltage electrical equipment has recently gained attention. Partial discharge (PD) analysis is one of the most promising solutions for monitoring and diagnosing potential problems in insulation systems. Noise is a major challenge in diagnosing and detecting defects when using this measurement. This study aims to denoise PD signals using a data decomposition method, improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise algorithm, combined with statistical significance test to increase noise reduction efficiency and to derive and visualize the Hilbert spectrum of the input signal in time-frequency domain after filtering the noise. In the PD signal analysis, both artificial and experimental signals were used as input signals in the decomposition method. For these signals, this study has yielded significant improvement in the denoising and the PD detecting process indicated by statistical measures. Thus, the signal decomposition by using the proposed method is proven to be a useful tool for diagnosing the PD on high voltage equipment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Denoising And Filtering Process; Emd; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Intrinsic Mode Function; White Noise; Efficiency; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Frequency Domain Analysis; Partial Discharges; Signal Denoising; Signal Detection; Wavelet Decomposition; White Noise; De-noising; Decomposition Methods; Denoising And Filtering Process; Emd; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Filtering Process; High-voltage Equipments; Intrinsic Mode Functions; Partial Discharge Signal; Signal Isolation; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Intrinsic Mode Functions","Efficiency; Electric power transmission networks; Frequency domain analysis; Partial discharges; Signal denoising; Signal detection; Wavelet decomposition; White noise; De-noising; Decomposition methods; Denoising and filtering process; EMD; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Filtering process; High-voltage equipments; Intrinsic Mode functions; Partial discharge signal; Signal isolation; Empirical mode decomposition; Intrinsic mode functions","","","V.C.T. received a support from Japanese Grant-Aid Program for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS).","Int J Eng Res Technol, (2016); undefined; Chan, Jeffery C., Stochastic noise removal on partial discharge measurement for transformer insulation diagnosis, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2014-October, October, (2014); Gulski, Edward, Digital Analysis of Partial Discharges, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 2, 5, pp. 822-837, (1995); High Voltage Test Techniques Partial Discharge Measurements, (2015); High Voltage Test Techniques; Koepf, U., Rejection of narrow-band noise and repetitive pulses in on-site PD measurements, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 2, 6, pp. 1180-1191, (1995); Khan, Sher Zaman, A New Adaptive Technique for On-line Partial Discharge Monitoring, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 2, 4, pp. 700-707, (1995); Fruth, Bernhard A., Partial discharge signal generation, transmission and acquisition, IEE Conference Publication, 378, pp. 27-28, (1993); Epi Int J Eng, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136875303"

For examining the applicability of porous grains coated with hydrophobic agents (HA) as low-cost and easily available filtration and adsorbent materials in the separation of oil and water, this study assessed the hydrophobicity/oleophilicity of porous grains made from autoclaved aerated concrete scrap coated with low-cost and harmless hydrophobic agents such as oleic and stearic acids. Tests using a sessile droplet method showed unique relationships between the contact angles (CA) of water droplets in air (CA<inf>wa</inf>), oil droplets in water (CA<inf>ow</inf>) and coated HA concentrations. The CA<inf>wa</inf> increased linearly with increasing HA concentration and then became almost constant and/or gently increased after a specific point, indicating that a minimum coating amount gives the maximum hydrophobicity to HA-coated porous grains exists. The CA<inf>ow</inf> gradually decreased exponentially with increasing HA concentration. In particular, the CA<inf>ow</inf> of porous grains coated with stearic acid decreased with increasing of HA concentration in a two-step process. Furthermore, analyses of the Pearson correlation showed that both CA<inf>wa</inf> and CA<inf>ow</inf> correlated well with the specific surface area (SSA), implying that the SSA is a good indicator as a quick assessment of hydrophobicity/oleophilicity of HA-coated porous grains. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved Aerated Concrete; Contact Angle; Filtration And Adsorbent Materials; Hydrophobicity/oleophilicity; Oil/water Separation; Oleic Acid; Sessile Droplet Method; Stearic Acid; Vietnam","","","","This research was supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science, and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

Moreover, optimal conditions to operate the system for a hot spring in Thailand were investigated as a case study, i.e., feasibility study for utilization of geothermal energy as renewable energy. The aggregated TEG module was installed in the heat transfer channel soaked into a hot water bath. The generated power was used to supply the Internet of things (IoT) system for hot-spring monitoring. The IoT system was connected to sensors of temperature, humidity, and sulfur dioxide (SO<inf>2</inf>) to monitor and collect the information of the hot spring. The information can be monitored on mobile phones via the application. Twenty TEG modules were installed in the heat transfer channel. The heat sinks were used to transfer the heat while soaking into the hot water bath. By using the IoT system, data of the hot-spring monitoring was collected on cloud backup. The results show that the power outputs increase relating to the increase of the temperature gradient. The correlations between the power output and the hot water bathing temperatures were reported. The IoT system can collect information of hot-spring monitoring properly.

The properties of a CLSM mixture made from cement, fly ash, and waste water treatment sludge (WTS) were examined in this study. The CLSM mixtures were prepared using several water-to-binder (w/b) ratios (0.5, 0.65, and 0.8) and WTS weight ratios (0, 20, 40, and 80%). A solution of 5M NaOH was employed as a mixture accelerator. The influences of WTS addition on the characteristics of both fresh and hardened CLSM were examined. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and the change in minerals and microstructures of the CLSM samples were also investigated. The experimental results demonstrated that incorporating WTS into CLSM results in significant changes in fresh unit weight and mixture workability. The CLSM properties were found to be strongly affected by both the w/b ratio and accelerator dosage. Moreover, the TCLP test confirmed that WTS can be used as a safe by-product because the leached levels of heavy metals from raw WTS and resulting CLSM were significantly less than the permitted thresholds. Finally, the CLSM designed using a w/b ratio of 0.65, accelerator of 5%, and 40% WTS achieved the highest performance that meets current relevant Taipei City design regulations for excavatable backfilling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accelerator; Cement; Controlled Low-strength Material; Fly Ash; Waste Water Treatment Sludge; Water-to-binder Ratio; Acceleration; Heavy Metals; Leaching; Mixtures; Portland Cement; Sodium Hydroxide; Wastewater Treatment; Accelerator; Controlled Low Strength Materials; Filling Materials; Material Mixture; Ternary Mixtures; Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedures; Waste Water Treatment Sludge; Waste-water Treatment; Water Treatment Sludge; Water-to-binder Ratio; Fly Ash","Acceleration; Heavy metals; Leaching; Mixtures; Portland cement; Sodium hydroxide; Wastewater treatment; Accelerator; Controlled low strength materials; Filling materials; Material mixture; Ternary mixtures; Toxicity characteristics leaching procedures; Waste water treatment sludge; Waste-water treatment; Water treatment sludge; Water-to-binder ratio; Fly ash","","","Funding for this investigation was provided by the Taipei Water Department (grant no. 10358003F31 ) in Taiwan.","Achtemichuk, Sasha, The utilization of recycled concrete aggregate to produce controlled low-strength materials without using Portland cement, Cement and Concrete Composites, 31, 8, pp. 564-569, (2009); Controlled Low Strength Materials, (1999); Chang, Zhiyang, Valorization of sewage sludge in the fabrication of construction and building materials: A review, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 154, (2020); Chen, Zhen, Comparative studies on the effects of sewage sludge ash and fly ash on cement hydration and properties of cement mortars, Construction and Building Materials, 154, pp. 791-803, (2017); Chindaprasirt, Prinya, Comparative study on the characteristics of fly ash and bottom ash geopolymers, Waste Management, 29, 2, pp. 539-543, (2009); Deng, An, Geotechnical and leaching properties of flowable fill incorporating waste foundry sand, Waste Management, 28, 11, pp. 2161-2170, (2008); Manh Do, Tan, Development of a new cementless binder for controlled low strength material (CLSM) using entirely by-products, Construction and Building Materials, 206, pp. 576-589, (2019); Do, Tan Manh, Engineering properties of controlled low strength material (CLSM) incorporating red mud, International Journal of Geo-Engineering, 7, 1, (2016); Ebert, Benjamin A.R., Impact of electrodialytic remediation of MSWI fly ash on hydration and mechanical properties of blends with Portland cement, Construction and Building Materials, 309, (2021); Fang, Xiaoliang, Transforming waterworks sludge into controlled low-strength material: Bench-scale optimization and field test validation, Journal of Environmental Management, 232, pp. 254-263, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129162179"

The proposal includes an algorithm to find a list of potential charging locations and their associated optimal charging time. Moreover, the Q-learning technique is adopted to determine the optimal next charging location among the candidates.

We adjusted the scenarios by replacing 25% and 50% of nitrogen chemical fertilizer with respective amounts of N-based organic fertilizer (S2 and S3). Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect primary data. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology with the “cradle to gate” approach was used to estimate GHG emission based on the functional unit of one hectare of growing area and one tonnage of fresh fruit weight. The emission factors of agrochemicals, fertilizers, electricity, fuel production, and internal combustion were collected from the MiLCA software, IPCC reports, and previous studies.

To avoid depleting natural granular materials, recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) from construction and demolition waste are now commonly used as an alternative. The mechanical behavior of RCA used in road construction is highly influ-enced by field conditions such as traffic load and moisture variation. The particle breakage of RCA influences long-term pavement performance because it changes the RCA grading over time. How-ever, the effect of moisture content (m.c.) on mechanical behavior and particle breakage during compaction and cyclic loading is often neglected. The aims of the study were to investigate the mechanism of permanent deformation development due to moisture change, the breakage response of RCA in this process, and the assessment of existing permanent deformation prediction model. The results showed that initial m.c. effectively controlled the deformation of RCA; the permanent axial strain (εpa) was enhanced, and the breakage of coarse fraction (19~9.5 mm) under cyclic loading was reduced at higher levels of m.c. Based on the experimental results, a modified model for predicting εpa was proposed, incorporating a deviation factor induced by m.c. The model fitted the experimental data well, suggesting that it is useful to have a quantitative estimation of εpa of RCA with different m.c. under cyclic loading. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyclic Loading; Moisture; Pavement; Permanent Deformation; Recycled Concrete Aggregates; Breakage; Compaction; Cyclic Loading; Deformation; Demolition; Infrastructure Planning; Moisture Content; Pavement; Road Construction","breakage; compaction; cyclic loading; deformation; demolition; infrastructure planning; moisture content; pavement; road construction","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was partially supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on science, and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

Their ability to convert solar energy to valuable compounds with minimal ecological footprint potentially places them as significant contributors to the clean-energy transition. Currently, algal hydrogen production, although promising, is not scalable because it is limited to oxygen-free conditions and is short-lived due to electron loss to other processes, mainly carbon fixation. Here, we show that a strain defective in thylakoid proton gradient regulation, Δpgr5, bypasses both challenges simultaneously, leading to a prolonged 12-day hydrogen production under ambient mixotrophic conditions in a 1-L setup. We report that Δpgr5 possess a repressed ability to fixate carbon and that this limitation is counterbalanced by an enhanced chloroplast-mitochondrion energetic exchange. This unique physiology supports the simplistic, yet robust and scalable, hydrogen production capability of Δpgr5. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioengineering; Chlamydomonas; Green Algae; Hydrogen; Mitochondria-chloroplast Interaction; Photosynthesis","","","","Funding text 1: The research was funded by ISF 1646/16 .; Funding text 2: The research was funded by ISF 1646/16.

Sri Lanka, in particular, faces serious difficulties in finding new sites for MSW disposal, due to the lack of available space; therefore, the rehabilitation of existing MSW dumping sites and the extension of their services are required to achieve sustainable urban development. To examine suitable rehabilitation techniques, it is essential to identify the physicochemical and mechanical properties of dumped MSW, fully considering climatic conditions, waste composition, and the time since the waste was dumped. In this study, therefore, the physicochemical and mechanical properties of dumped MSW were investigated; the dumped MSW was taken from existing MSW dumping sites in three climate zones in Sri Lanka, namely the Karadiyana site in the wet zone, Udapalatha in the intermediate zone, and Hambantota in the dry zone, and it was taken at different times after being dumped. The results showed that the waste composition and biodegradation of organic materials affected the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the dumped waste. The measured compaction parameters of the “old” sites at Udapalatha and Hambantota were higher compared to the “new” sites. Compaction parameters at the Karadiyana site, on the other hand, were low, at even >20 years since being dumped, probably due to the high amount of scarcely compacted materials. In direct shear tests, both strain hardening and softening of the waste samples were observed, depending on the difference in vertical stress. Based on the Pearson correlations among measured physicochemical and mechanical parameters, it was found that the loss on ignition (LOI) would be a good indicator to quickly assess the mechanical parameters of “new” and “old” waste materials, due to the small sensitivities to waste age and climate conditions in Sri Lanka. In particular, LOI correlated well to measured specific gravity and compaction properties, and the r2 values of correlations exceeded |0.80|. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compaction; Municipal Solid Waste (msw); Open Dumping; Shear Strength; Waste Age; Waste Composition; Biodegradation; Climate Conditions; Compaction; Municipal Solid Waste; Physicochemical Property; Waste Management; Sri Lanka","biodegradation; climate conditions; compaction; municipal solid waste; physicochemical property; waste management; Sri Lanka","","","This research was supported by the JST?JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for the Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Fernando, Rangika Lalitha S., Solid waste management of local governments in the Western Province of Sri Lanka: An implementation analysis, Waste Management, 84, pp. 194-203, (2019); Falamaki, Amin, Laboratory Simulation of Aeration on Municipal Solid Waste from Barmshoor Landfill, International Journal of Civil Engineering, 17, 6, pp. 897-906, (2019); Sustainable Urbanization Strategy Undps Support to Sustainable Inclusive and Resilient Cities in the Developing World, (2016); Proceedings of the International Symposium on Advances in Civil and Environmental Engineering Practices for Sustainable Development Aceps, (2025); Iqbal, Muhammad Rashid, Geotechnical properties of sludge blended with crushed concrete and incineration ash, International Journal of GEOMATE, 16, 57, pp. 116-123, (2019); Asadi, Mohsen, Validation of Hyperbolic Model by the Results of Triaxial and Direct Shear Tests of Municipal Solid Waste, Geotechnical and Geological Engineering, 35, 5, pp. 2003-2015, (2017); Zhao, Yanru, A study of shear strength properties of municipal solid waste in Chongqing landfill, China, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 21, 22, pp. 12605-12615, (2014); Advances in Environmental Geotechnics, (2025); Singh, Manoj Kumar, Shear strength testing of intact and recompacted samples of municipal solid waste, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 46, 10, pp. 1133-1145, (2009); Zhan, Liangtong, Shear strength characterization of municipal solid waste at the Suzhou landfill, China, Engineering Geology, 97, 3-4, pp. 97-111, (2008)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129138594"

In this study, a series of compaction, California bearing ratio, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and particle breakage tests of well– and poor–graded mixtures of recycled clay brick aggregates (RCBs) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) with maximum aggregate diameters of 19, 25, and 37.5 mm were carried out to examine the practical application of those mixtures to unbound roadbed materials in Vietnam. The experimental results suggest that the maximum amount of RCBs added to RCAs should be less than 30% when applied to unbound roadbed materials. In addition, it was found that the mixing proportions of RCBs and RCAs and the maximum aggregate diameter, gradation of aggregates, and initial moisture condition control the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Further, the particle breakage characteristics under compaction were carefully examined, and it was found that the percentage increment/decrement, as well as a newly introduced method of estimating the mixing proportions of RCAs and RCBs in the fine fraction (<2.36 mm), is effective in understanding the mechanism of particle breakage of RCA and RCB mixtures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","California Bearing Ratio (cbr); Compaction; Hydraulic Conductivity; Particle Breakage; Recycled Clay Brick Aggregate; Recycled Concrete Aggregate; Road Base And Subbase; Aggregate; Breakage; Concrete; Hydraulic Conductivity; Road Construction; Viet Nam","aggregate; breakage; concrete; hydraulic conductivity; road construction; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the JST?JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was supported by the JST–JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development Program (SATREPS) project (No. JPMJSA1701).; Funding text 3: Acknowledgments: This research was supported by JST-JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (No. JPMJSA1701).","Pratap, Vinay, Solid Waste Treatment: Technological Advancements and Challenges, pp. 215-231, (2021); Nguyen, Hoang Giang, Current management condition and waste composition characteristics of construction and demolition waste landfills in hanoi of vietnam, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 18, (2021); Singh, Pradeep Pratap, Solid waste management through the concept of zero waste, pp. 293-318, (2021); Nguyen, Van Dinh, Current status of construction and demolition waste management in Vietnam: Challenges and opportunities, International Journal of GEOMATE, 15, 52, pp. 23-29, (2018); Yazdani, M., Improving construction and demolition waste collection service in an urban area using a simheuristic approach: A case study in Sydney, Australia, Journal of Cleaner Production, 280, (2021); Asif, Muhammad, Life cycle assessment: A case study of a dwelling home in Scotland, Building and Environment, 42, 3, pp. 1391-1394, (2007); Agamuthu, Pariatamby, Challenges in sustainable management of construction and demolition waste, Waste Management and Research, 26, 6, pp. 491-492, (2008); Hoang, Ngoc Han, A review of construction and demolition waste management in Southeast Asia, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 22, 2, pp. 315-325, (2020); Norouzi, Masoud, Circular economy in the building and construction sector: A scientific evolution analysis, Journal of Building Engineering, 44, (2021); Lieder, Michael, Towards circular economy implementation: A comprehensive review in context of manufacturing industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 115, pp. 36-51, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129132418"

This study aims to investigate the plugging performance of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media through a series of sandpack experiments. First of all, CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluids were generated by stirring CO<inf>2</inf> gas diffused into polymer (Xanthan gum (XG)) and surfactant (Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) solution with different gas: liquid ratios. Then, CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles fluids were injected into single-core and dual-core sandpack systems. The results show that the rheological behaviors of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluids in this study were followed the Power-law model at room temperature. The apparent viscosity of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid increased as the gas: liquid ratio increased. CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles could block pore throat due to the “Jamin effect” and increase the resistance in porous media. The blocking ability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles reached an optimal value at the gas:liquid ratio of 20% in the homogeneous porous media. Moreover, the selective pugging ability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in dual-core sandpack tests was significant. CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles exhibited a good flow control profile in the high permeability region and flexibility to flow over the pore constrictions in the low permeability region, leading to an ultimate fractional flow proportion (50%:50%) in the dual-core sandpack model with a permeability differential of 1.0:2.0 darcy. The fractional flow ratio was considerable compared with a polymer injection. At the higher heterogeneity of porous media (0.5:2.0 darcy), CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid could still establish a good swept performance. This makes CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid injection a promising candidate for heterogeneous reservoirs where conventional CO<inf>2</inf> flooding processes have limited ability. This finding would be helpful in developing the utilization of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in EOR operation by better understanding their plugging mechanism in porous media. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co2 Microbubbles; Co2-enhanced Oil Recovery; Dual-core Sandpack Model; Heterogeneous Porous Media; Plugging Ability; Single-core Sandpack Model; Enhanced Recovery; Flow Of Fluids; Gases; Liquids; Oil Well Flooding; Petroleum Reservoir Engineering; Porous Materials; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Sulfur Compounds; Co2 Microbubble; Co2-enhanced Oil Recovery; Dual-core; Dual-core Sandpack Model; Enhanced-oil Recoveries; Heterogeneous Porous Media; Microbubble Fluids; Microbubbles; Plugging Ability; Single-core Sandpack Model; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Hydrocarbon Reservoir; Permeability; Polymer; Porous Medium; Surfactant; Viscosity","Enhanced recovery; Flow of fluids; Gases; Liquids; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Porous materials; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Sulfur compounds; CO2 microbubble; CO2-enhanced oil recovery; Dual-core; Dual-core sandpack model; Enhanced-oil recoveries; Heterogeneous porous media; Microbubble fluids; Microbubbles; Plugging ability; Single-core sandpack model; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; enhanced oil recovery; hydrocarbon reservoir; permeability; polymer; porous medium; surfactant; viscosity","","","We would like to thank the support of time and facilities for this study from Kyushu University, Japan, and Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM, Vietnam.","Alizadeh, Ali, Mathematical modeling of the Colloidal Gas Aphron transport through porous medium using the filtration theory, Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 44, pp. 37-53, (2017); Alizadeh, Ali, Modeling of micro-bubble surfactant multi-layer drilling fluid stability based on single bubble behavior under pressure and temperature in a deviated gas well, Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 26, pp. 42-50, (2015); Arabloo, Milad, Experimental studies on stability and viscoplastic modeling of colloidal gas aphron (CGA) based drilling fluids, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 113, pp. 8-22, (2014); Bachu, Stefan, Identification of oil reservoirs suitable for CO2-EOR and CO2 storage (CCUS) using reserves databases, with application to Alberta, Canada, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 44, pp. 152-165, (2016); Bjorndalen, H.

Many current researches focus on incentives-based DR research orientation. In addition, accurately quantifying the incentive payment is also a significant challenge because of the fact that the incentive payment is currently determined depending on knowledge, experience, and experimental results. This paper presents a method of pricing incentive payments for the incentive-based DR program through social welfare maximization framework which ensures the benefits of all participants involved. Besides, this study also proposed the quantification of incentive payments by a theoretical approach based on the satisfaction level of electricity consumers which is approximated through a fuzzy logic model. Moreover, the impact of renewable energy sources on the pricing mechanism and benefits of all parties participating in the DR program is also discussed through the calculation cost for renewable energy integration and emission cost function.

In this report, we investigated the transesterification kinetics by varying IPA amount and the optimum conditions for BDF production with 10 wt% IPA. In the IPA amount of 5 to 25 wt%, the transesterification proceeded in a heterogeneous condition (FAME and glycerol [GL] phases) as the GL phase was formed and separated from the FAME phase. The transesterification rate increased with the increase of IPA amount, and the correlation coefficient (r) between the rate constant and IPA amount was 0.97 (P < 0.05). The optimal conditions of transesterification for biodiesel production from canola oil with 10 wt% IPA were as follows: 1.0 wt% KOH, MeOH/oil molar ratio of 6:1, and a reaction temperature of 30°C. The quality of biodiesel satisfied the JIS K2390 and EN 14214 standards. Transesterification using 10 wt% IPA co-solvent could facilitate the phase separation after the reaction, and the amount of waste was reduced. The recovery of IPA from FAME phase was >96%, hence IPA could be reused. These results indicated that IPA was a superior co-solvent for the BDF production from plant oil feedstocks.

Anhydrite, quartz, and hematite were observed for WD heat-treated up to 1000 °C under air atmosphere. The peak of anhydrite for WD was stronger than others at all temperatures. This can be attributed to the difference in the SO<inf>3</inf> content in the ash. A part of anhydrite in WD and BZ changed to gehlenite by heat treatment up to 1200 °C, while anhydrite was observed for UF heat-treated. It seems that this would be due to the difference in Ca content. Troilite formed by the reduction of pyrite was observed under argon treatment for coals other than WD.

However, alkali-silica reaction (ASR) will be a serious problem when the recycled glass is used as concrete aggregates. This paper shows an investigation of the alkali-silica reaction of glass sand mortar under steam curing. The test for ASR expansion follows ASTM C1567. Type F fly ash (FA) is used together with Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mixing with mixed color glass sand. FA contents are of 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% as OPC replacement. Steam curing accelerating FA reaction is used to contribute to the mitigation of ASR by strength improvement of the mortar. Under steam curing, the results show that the recommended contents of FA to use are of 20% to 30% to ensure expansion lower than the threshold of ASTM. Moreover, steam curing increases the expansion of the glass sand mortar in compared to the moist curing, and expansion crack appears at the interface between glass sand and cementitious matrix, not in the glass sand. In comparison with glass sand mortar under moist curing, expansion of glass sand mortar using fly ash under steam curing is contributed primarily by: (1) delayed ettringite formation, (2) reducing ion transportation, (3) increasing tensile strength of fly ash glass sand mortar and (4) reducing glass sand dissolution rate in rich alkalinity solution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkali-silica Reaction; Fly Ash; Recycled Glass Aggregate; Steam Curing","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for supporting this research through the CRC 2016 project of the AUN/SEED-Net Program.

In this study, the evolution of the char characteristics throughout the gasification process was deeply investigated. The low ash content, high heating value, and fast char conversion rate highlighted the suitability of bagasse for gasification. The char morphology underwent significant changes with rupture of beehive-like structures that make up the char when conversion X [0, 1] is higher than 0.5. On the contrary, changes in carbon structures were observed more clearly at the beginning of char conversion (X < 0.5). The gasified chars had high porosity made of micro-mesoporous structures, and the maximum value of total specific surface area (S<inf>BET</inf> = 877 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (V<inf>BET</inf> = 0.49 cm3 g−1) were observed at X = 0.75.

To date, simulation models of Nam-Su FBR have failed to give an adequate history match without invoking the presence of large aquifers. In a previous study (Son et al., 2007), the authors investigated several possible alternatives to achieve a satisfactory history match. They modeled porosity reduction by compaction along with the change of aquifer size and produced an improved history match that is consistent with the geological nature of the system. The key to such modeling is reservoir rock compressibility. Estimating the values of rock compressibility from cores is a challenge in FBR's due to the failure of coring from a naturally fractured interval, and thus reliable values are not available. We developed a computer-assisted history matching method to resolve these two problems together and save significant time compared to the manual trial-and-error methods used to adjust these parameters generally used in Vietnam. The methodology developed has been applied successfully to determine rock compaction coefficients and adjust aquifers' sizes of the Nam-Su FBR. Comparisons between our adjusted model and the existing model show considerable improvement between computed and measured values. Simulators can always be adjusted to obtain a history match even with geologically unrealistic values. The approach outlined here is more physically realistic than existing approaches and hence should provide/provides better production and other forecasts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aquifer Size; Computer-aided Engineering; Fractured Basement Reservoir; History Matching; Permeability Anisotropy; Reservoir Compressibility; Reservoir Simulation; Rock Compaction; Aquifers; Compaction; Compressibility; Computer Aided Engineering; Fracture; Hydrogeology; Offshore Oil Well Production; Petroleum Reservoir Engineering; Petroleum Reservoirs; Aquifer Size; Computer-aided Engineering; Fractured Basement Reservoirs; History Match; History Matching; Permeability Anisotropy; Reservoir Compressibility; Reservoir-simulation; Rock Compaction; Viet Nam; Rocks; Aquifer; Compaction; Compressibility; Computer Aided Design; Fracture Zone; Hydrocarbon Reservoir; Offshore Structure; Oil Production; Permeability; Porosity; Source Rock","Aquifers; Compaction; Compressibility; Computer aided engineering; Fracture; Hydrogeology; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Aquifer size; Computer-aided engineering; Fractured basement reservoirs; History match; History matching; Permeability anisotropy; Reservoir compressibility; Reservoir-simulation; Rock compaction; Viet Nam; Rocks; aquifer; compaction; compressibility; computer aided design; fracture zone; hydrocarbon reservoir; offshore structure; oil production; permeability; porosity; source rock","","","The research was supported by state project code 001.19.CNKK.QG of Vietnam.

Yet how offshore wind energy will respond to the rapidly intensifying global warming remains inconclusive. Focusing on a tropical sea in Vietnam, this study assesses the climatic impact of global warming on the local offshore wind potential. Dynamically downscaled wind data obtained by an edge-cutting fine-resolution regional climate model with two greenhouse-gases Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 8.5 and 4.5 were biased-corrected with a quantile mapping method before using for assessment. Results revealed a changing trend of the annual-mean offshore wind speed and power potential in Vietnam under both scenarios. However, the change is seasonally asymmetric with decreases of about 2 – 10% in September-October-November and slight increases of about 2 – 4% in December-January-February. The turbine-based assessment showed that the cumulative annual energy obtained from the 12 MW and 8 MW turbines could reach the highest about 50.9 GWh and 30.7 GWh (2080–2099 average under scenario RCP8.5) but the difference in their capacity factor is much smaller, suggesting that turbine 8 MW should be considered in the sense of cost-effectiveness in some areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bias Correction; Climate Change; Future Offshore Wind Energy; Vietnam; Wind Speed; Wind Turbine; Climate Models; Cost Effectiveness; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Offshore Oil Well Production; Tropics; Wind Power; Bias Correction; Climatic Impact; Energy Strategy; Future Offshore Wind Energy; Global Climate Changes; Off-shore Wind Energy; Offshore Wind Resources; Offshore Winds; Viet Nam; Wind Speed; Wind; Climate Change; Energy Management; Global Climate; Mapping Method; Offshore Structure","Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Offshore oil well production; Tropics; Wind power; Bias correction; Climatic impact; Energy strategy; Future offshore wind energy; Global climate changes; Off-shore wind energy; Offshore wind resources; Offshore winds; Viet Nam; Wind speed; Wind; climate change; energy management; global climate; mapping method; offshore structure","","","Funding text 1: Quang Vu Dinh has been supported in part by a research grant from the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant No. 12/RC/2302 – P2.

To evaluate the heat balance in paved surfaces and to select appropriate road construction materials that help suppress heat islands, an accurate understanding of heat transport parameters such as thermal conductivity (λ) and heat capacity (HC) is important. Recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste, including scrap construction materials and industrial by-products, are often used for road construction; however, λ and HC of recycled aggregates especially for roadbeds are not fully un-derstood. This study involved a series of laboratory tests to measure λ and HC of recycled concrete and clay brick aggregates (<40 mm) and their mixtures with autoclaved aerated concrete grains (<2 mm) under varied moisture conditions. The measured λ and HC increased with increasing volu-metric water content (θ). Closed-form models for estimating λ(θ) were proposed using normalized thermal conductivity (λe) and effective saturation (Se). The new λe(Se) models performed well for the measured data compared to previously proposed models and would be useful to evaluate λ of recycled aggregates for roadbed materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (aac); Construction And Demolition Waste (cdw); Heat Capacity; Recycled Aggregates; Thermal Conductivity; Urban Heat Islands; Aggregate; Concrete; Demolition; Measurement Method; Numerical Model; Recycling; Road Construction; Thermal Conductivity","aggregate; concrete; demolition; measurement method; numerical model; recycling; road construction; thermal conductivity","","","Funding: This research was supported by the project of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Science, and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (no.

(2) Methods: Surveys were distributed to 578 participants in selected international companies in Turkey, Taiwan, Japan, and China. To reduce uncertainty and errors, the surveys were rigorously evaluated and did not show a normal distribution, as it was determined that 85 participants did not consciously fill out the questionnaires, and the questionnaires from the remaining 493 participants were used. By using the evaluation model of employee satisfaction based on a back propagation (BP) neural network, we explored the manifestation and impact of abusive management and self-efficacy. Using the listed real estate businesses as an example, we proposed a deep learning BP neural network-based employee job satisfaction evaluation model and a human–machine technology-based employee performance evaluation system under situational perception, according to the design requirements of human– machine interaction. (3) Results: The results show that the human–machine interface can log in according to the correct verbal instructions of the employees. In terms of age and education level variables, employees’ perceptions of leaders’ abusive management and self-efficacy are significantly different from their job performances, respectively (p < 0.01).

The anaerobic system consisted of hydrolysis reactor (hydraulic retention time (HRT) 5 d, 35 °C) and methanogenesis reactor (HRT 9 d, 35 °C). The addition of oyster shells led to hydrolysis of 40.33% ± 3.1% of the carbon, whereas alkali reactor hydrolysed almost half (48.68% ± 1.4%). In methanogenesis stage, the highest methane yield under pH adjustment by oyster shells was 580 mL/gVS; 51.05% of the carbon in methanogenesis reactor was converted into methane, generating 1.49–2.00 kWh/kgVS of energy. In comparison, methane yield with NaOH as an alkali was higher (667 mL/gVS), and 59.71% of the carbon was converted into methane, generating 1.97–2.55 kWh/kgVS of energy. To facilitate the digestion of hydrolysate produced using NaOH, we had to remove excess sludge because of sludge accumulation, whereas this was not necessary in oyster-shell treatment. Although NaOH conditioner had higher methane production performance, the oyster-shell conditioner can function as a buffer that regulates itself to keep the pH of the reactor stable with a rapid increase in the hydrogen-ion concentration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic Digestion; Carbon Flow; Methane; Oyster Shell; Agricultural Wastes; Carbon; Hydrolysis; Methane; Shells (structures); Sludge Digestion; Sodium Hydroxide; Anaerobic Co-digestion; Carbon Flow; Energy; Flow Analysis; Hydraulic Retention; Kitchen Waste; Methane Yield; Methanogenesis; Oyster Shell; Retention Time; Anaerobic Digestion; Additive; Anaerobic Digestion; Carbon; Equipment; Hydrolysis; Methanogenesis; Shell; Ostreidae","Agricultural wastes; Carbon; Hydrolysis; Methane; Shells (structures); Sludge digestion; Sodium hydroxide; Anaerobic co-digestion; Carbon flow; Energy; Flow analysis; Hydraulic retention; Kitchen waste; Methane Yield; Methanogenesis; Oyster shell; Retention time; Anaerobic digestion; additive; anaerobic digestion; carbon; equipment; hydrolysis; methanogenesis; shell; Ostreidae","","","","Pohland, Frederick George (Compiler), Developments in anaerobic stabilization of organic wastes - the two-phase concept, Environmental Letters, 1, 4, pp. 255-266, (1971); Pham van, Dinh, The fate of carbon in two-stage anaerobic digestion of vegetable waste, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 307, 1, (2019); Appels, Lise, Principles and potential of the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge, Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 34, 6, pp. 755-781, (2008); Bajpai, Pratima K., Basics of anaerobic digestion process, SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology, 9789811041297, pp. 7-12, (2017); Yu, Hanqing, Acidogenesis of gelatin-rich wastewater in an upflow anaerobic reactor: Influence of pH and temperature, Water Research, 37, 1, pp. 55-66, (2003); Babel, Sandhya, Effect of acid speciation on solid waste liquefaction in an anaerobic acid digester, Water Research, 38, 9, pp. 2417-2423, (2004); Notodarmojo, Peni Astrini, Oyster shell as pH control substitute for two stage anaerobic co-digestion system, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 83, pp. 481-486, (2021); Lee, Chang-hoon, Effects of oyster shell on soil chemical and biological properties and cabbage productivity as a liming materials, Waste Management, 28, 12, pp. 2702-2708, (2008); Morris, James P., Shells from aquaculture: a valuable biomaterial, not a nuisance waste product, Reviews in Aquaculture, 11, 1, pp. 42-57, (2019); Acad J Environ Res, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03605442; 18736785","0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808","ENEYD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117126658"

Community-based ecotourism (CBET) has specific benefits closely related to the sustainability of natural ecosystems and community development. CBET can be defined as nature-based tourism, helping shape the types of tourism services, planning and developing destinations provided by communities directly. CBET is supposed to be a sustainable alternative to mass tourism by its potential benefits in Vietnam. The study aims to evaluate the sustainability of four CBET destinations in Central Vietnam through a sustainable ecotourism index (SEI) formed by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Based on the literature review, local people, and experts’ recommendations, a set of fourteen criteria categorized into five groups reflecting the critical attributes of the sustainable CBET that include environmental conservation, economic benefits, community participation, cultural preservation, and empowerment are analyzed. The raw data is obtained from in-depth interviews with 21 experts and 42 households. After normalizing, the results indicate that out of four CBET destinations, one is identified as high sustainability (SEI>4.2), two are neutral (3.4<SEI<4.2), and one is lower than (SEI<3.4). These findings provide implications for extending the AHP theory in tourism and policy implications toward sustainable development in future tourism. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (ahp); Central Vietnam; Community-based Ecotourism; Sustainable Ecotourism Index (sei)","","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the ?sia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (?PN) through project CB?2019-02MY-Hoang.

One of the most critical issues in dealing with the multipath transmission is appropriately scheduling the pathways in order to guarantee QoS. Despite the fact that tremendous effort has been put into developing multipath scheduling algorithms, existing approaches suffer from several limitations when dealing with the network's dynamicity, including congestion and packet loss. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforcement learning-based multipath transport protocol named SATO, which efficiently schedules multipath communication in heterogeneous wireless networks. By leveraging the self-learning ability of reinforcement learning, a node equipped with SATO can capture the environmental changes and select transmission paths based on an appropriate policy to optimize QoS. Our evaluation results show that SATO improves the QoS by 10%-15% in simulation and 12% in a real deployment compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mpquic; Multipath Scheduling; Q-learning; 5g Mobile Communication Systems; Heterogeneous Networks; Internet Protocols; Scheduling Algorithms; Wireless Networks; Commercialisation; Critical Issues; Heterogeneous Wireless Network; Mpquic; Multipath Scheduling; Multipath Transport Protocols; Network Generation; Q-learning; Reinforcement Learnings; Single Path; Reinforcement Learning","5G mobile communication systems; Heterogeneous networks; Internet protocols; Scheduling algorithms; Wireless networks; Commercialisation; Critical issues; Heterogeneous wireless network; MPQUIC; Multipath scheduling; Multipath transport protocols; Network generation; Q-learning; Reinforcement learnings; Single path; Reinforcement learning","","","","Paasch, Christoph, Multipath TCP, Communications of the ACM, 57, 4, pp. 51-57, (2014); De Coninck, Quentin, Multipath QUIC: Design and evaluation, pp. 160-166, (2017); Ferlin, Simone, BLEST: Blocking estimation-based MPTCP scheduler for heterogeneous networks, pp. 431-439, (2016); Lim, Yeonsup, ECF: An MPTCP path scheduler to manage heterogeneous paths, pp. 147-159, (2017); Wu, Hongjia, Peekaboo: Learning-Based Multipath Scheduling for Dynamic Heterogeneous Environments, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 38, 10, pp. 2295-2310, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CAS); IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc); IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA); IEEE Reliability Society (RS); IEEE Signal Processing Society","8th IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things, WF-IoT 2022","","Hybrid, Yokohama","189841","","9781665491532","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164112314"

The SVC architecture is hierarchically presented by three layers. The upper layer determines the total lateral force and the total yaw moment based on the control of sideslip angle and yaw rate. The middle layer determines optimum tire lateral force distribution depending on the total tire workload.

However, localization based on only a monocular camera or visual odometry is one of the most challenging research topics. Conventional methods are proposed based on the detection of key features in each image and matching them on consecutive images to estimate the camera motions. Deep-learning methods have also been studied to solve the problem. Although the current learning-based visual odometry methods score high results on public datasets, there is a lack of real-time implementation of the methods in common robot operating systems such as ROS to integrate them into a navigation system. In this paper, we introduce a ROS implementation of state-of-the-art conventional feature-based method, ORB-SLAM3, together with a deep-learning-based method, SC-SfMLearner for real-time UAV localization. A photo-realistic simulator, Flightmare, is used to test the implementation together with another navigation task such as control. The implementation can evaluate both algorithms in real-time operation to compare their performances. Based on evaluation results from the simulated environments, the limitation or failure cases of the algorithms could be found, then, the best parameters of the algorithms can be adjusted to improve the algorithms to avoid failures in practical experiments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Flightmare; Orb-slam3; Ros Implementation; Visual Odometry; Cameras; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Navigation Systems; Real Time Control; Robot Operating System; Robot Vision; State Estimation; Vision; Visual Servoing; Feature-based; Flightmare; Gps/imu; Localisation; Monocular Cameras; Orb-slam3; Real- Time; Ros Implementation; Visual Odometry; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav)","Cameras; Deep learning; Learning systems; Navigation systems; Real time control; Robot Operating System; Robot vision; State estimation; Vision; Visual servoing; Feature-based; Flightmare; GPS/IMU; Localisation; Monocular cameras; ORB-SLAM3; Real- time; ROS implementation; Visual odometry; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is funded by the Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) under project number NDT/AT/22/09.","Nistér, David, Visual odometry, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1, pp. I652-I659, (2004); Baker, Simon, Lucas-Kanade 20 years on: A unifying framework, International Journal of Computer Vision, 56, 3, pp. 221-255, (2004); Zhou, Tinghui, Unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion from video, 2017-January, pp. 6612-6621, (2017); Bian, Jiawang, Unsupervised scale-consistent depth and ego-motion learning from monocular video, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, (2019); Geiger, Andreas, Are we ready for autonomous driving? the KITTI vision benchmark suite, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3354-3361, (2012); Burri, Michael, The EuRoC micro aerial vehicle datasets, International Journal of Robotics Research, 35, 10, pp. 1157-1163, (2016); Corr, (2016); Campos, Carlos, ORB-SLAM3: An Accurate Open-Source Library for Visual, Visual-Inertial, and Multimap SLAM, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 37, 6, pp. 1874-1890, (2021); Flightmare A Flexible Quadrotor Simulator, (2020); Furrer, Fadri, RotorS—A modular gazebo MAV simulator framework, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 625, pp. 595-625, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","11th International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences, ICCAIS 2022","","Hanoi","185694","","9781665452489","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146438411"

The previous studies have recently undertaken significant research on air pollution and air quality monitoring. Unfortunately, this area continues to be challenged by unresolved issues. This paper proposes an IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting System to monitor and predict air pollution for a specific area based on various pollution factors. Using Arduino UNO R3 and various low-cost sensors, our IoT system can collect and monitor pollutants, such as PM2.5, CO2, CO, as well as temperature and humidity. The air quality data was collected for several months. To overcome the problems of instability of low-cost devices in monitoring, machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as K-Nearest-Neighbour (KNN), Expectation-Maximization (EM), Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and Autoregressive-Moving-Average (ARMA), are applied to address missing data and outliers due to technical issues. The KNN model outperformed all others in terms of RMSE, MSE, MAE, R-squared, and execution time. Then, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms are applied to predict future air quality. The result shows that our system can predict the air quality factors over the next hour with the highest accuracy at 96 %. Finally, a web interface was created to monitor and forecast air quality in real-time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Quality Forecasting; Air Quality Monitoring; Arma; Em; Iot; Knn; Lstm; Mice; Air Quality; Costs; Forecasting; Internet Of Things; Learning Algorithms; Mammals; Maximum Principle; Nearest Neighbor Search; Air Quality Forecasting; Air Quality Monitoring; Autoregressive/moving Averages; Expectation Maximization; Iot; K-near-neighbor; Multiple Imputation; Multiple Imputation By Chained Equation; Nearest-neighbour; Quality Monitoring System; Long Short-term Memory","Air quality; Costs; Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Mammals; Maximum principle; Nearest neighbor search; Air quality forecasting; Air quality monitoring; Autoregressive/moving averages; Expectation Maximization; IoT; K-near-neighbor; Multiple imputation; Multiple imputation by chained equation; Nearest-neighbour; Quality monitoring system; Long short-term memory","","","","Vietnam Ranks 4th in the Number of Pollutionlinked Deaths in the Western Pacific Region, (2019); World Wide Web, (2011); Jo, Jun Ho, Development of an IoT-Based indoor air quality monitoring platform, Journal of Sensors, 2020, (2020); Grath, Sean Mc, IoT Personal Air Quality Monitor, (2020); Medeiros, Helton Pierre Lucena De, An IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring Platform, (2020); Management, (2020); Zheng, Hong, A multiple kernel learning approach for air quality prediction, Advances in Meteorology, 2018, (2018); Zhu, Dixian, A machine learning approach for air quality prediction: Model regularization and optimization, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 2, 1, pp. 1-15, (2018); Saini, Jagriti, Indoor air quality prediction using optimizers: A comparative study, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 39, 5, pp. 7053-7069, (2020); Mumtaz, Rafia, Internet of things (Iot) based indoor air quality sensing and predictive analytic—a covid-19 perspective, Electronics (Switzerland), 10, 2, pp. 1-26, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","EVN HCMC; IEEE; IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMC)","6th International Conference on Green Technology and Sustainable Development, GTSD 2022","","Nha Trang City; Nha Trang University, Khanh Hoa Province","185680","","9781665466288","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146436984"

In which, issues of the iron loss in magnetic cores under different operating conditions of these converters are important and should be considered thoroughly. Therefore, this paper presents an experimental investigation of the iron loss characteristics of an amorphous ring core under the silicon carbide (SiC) inverter excitation at high carrier frequencies of up to 200 kHz using a high sampling rate of up to 5 GS/s in measurement. Effects of large changes in the dead-time and modulation index of the SiC inverter on the iron loss density of the amorphous ring are also examined. Moreover, impacts of several key factors, such as the fast-rising time in nanoseconds, ringing phenomenon occurring at megahertz frequency, total harmonic distortion (THD) of the ring's voltage, and minor B-H loops, on the increase in the iron loss density are analyzed. In addition, the iron loss properties of the amorphous ring core are compared to that of another ring core made from a non-oriented electrical steel for reference. Finally, concise physic-based insights and explanations for the main results are shown. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorphous Silicon; Electric Inverters; Iron; Semiconductor Devices; Silicon Steel; Wide Band Gap Semiconductors; Dead Time; Different Operating Conditions; High Frequency Hf; High Power Density Converter; High Sampling Rates; Iron Loss; Loss Properties; Ring-core; Transformer Core; Wide-bandgap Semiconductor Devices; Silicon Carbide","Amorphous silicon; Electric inverters; Iron; Semiconductor devices; Silicon steel; Wide band gap semiconductors; Dead time; Different operating conditions; High frequency HF; High power density converter; High sampling rates; Iron loss; Loss properties; Ring-core; Transformer core; Wide-bandgap semiconductor devices; Silicon carbide","","","","Ni, Ze, A 100-kW SiC Switched Tank Converter for Transportation Electrification, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 35, 6, pp. 5770-5784, (2020); Nguyen, Gia Minh Thao, A modified PAM control with automatic angle excitation for experimental IPMSM in consideration of SiC inverter and motor core loss, (2019); Itoh, Junichi, Experimental verification of EMC filter used for PWM inverter with wide band-gap devices, IEEJ Journal of Industry Applications, 4, 3, pp. 212-219, (2015); Khan, Shakil Ahamed, An Amorphous Alloy Magnetic-Bus-Based SiC NPC Converter with Inherent Voltage Balancing for Grid-Connected Renewable Energy Systems, IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, 29, 2, (2019); Shawky, Ahmed, Analysis and experimentation of modular differential inverter utilizing SEPIC modules and sic devices for grid connected applications, IEEJ Journal of Industry Applications, 9, 5, pp. 573-583, (2020); Adamowicz, Marek, SiC-based power electronic traction transformer (PETT) for 3 kV DC rail traction, Energies, 13, 21, (2020); Sato, Kenji, Outstanding technical features of traction system in N700S Shinkansen new generation standardized high speed train, IEEJ Journal of Industry Applications, 10, 4, pp. 402-410, (2021); Nguyen, Gia Minh Thao, A comprehensive analysis study about harmonic resonances in megawatt grid-connected wind farms, pp. 387-394, (2014); Suzuki, Tsuyoshi, Fabrication and Properties of under 10 μ m Sized Amorphous Powders of High B s Soft Magnetic Alloy for High-Frequency Applications, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 54, 11, (2018); Imaoka, Jun, Modeling, magnetic design, simulation methods, and experimental evaluation of various powder cores used in power converters considering their dc superimposition characteristics, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 34, 9, pp. 9033-9051, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES); IEEE Industry Aplications Society (IAS); IEEE Power Electronics Society (PELS)","2022 International Power Electronics Conference, IPEC-Himeji 2022-ECCE Asia","","Himeji; Himeji City Culture and Convention Center","180593","","9784886864253","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134196488"

This study aims to analyze the local context in motorcycle-based societies, which may affect the establishment of travelers’ choice set after the appearance of RHSs. In particular, it empirically compares three types of choice-set structures in the context of urban travel mode choice by estimating standard logit and nested logit models to test six hypotheses on the associations of RHS adoption with its determinants. Revealed preference data of 449 trips from both RHS users and non-RHS users were collected through a face-to-face interview-based questionnaire survey in Hanoi, Vietnam, in December 2020. The results of model estimations revealed: (1) a substitutional effect for two-wheelers but not for four-wheelers, (2) a significant positive influence of car ownership on car RHS adoption but not on motorcycle RHS adoption, (3) significantly high sensitivity to travel time of motorcycle RHS but not of car RHS, (4) a significant negative effect of traffic congestion on car RHS adoption but an insignificant one on motorcycle RHS adoption, and (5) a significant positive association of an individual’s experience in using a smartphone with car RHSs but insignificant association with motorcycle RHSs. Our findings suggest that transportation policies of RHS motorcycles should be different from those of RHS cars because of the heterogeneity in travel behaviors of RHS users between them. They also indicate that the transition from motorcycles to cars as well as the difference in service availability among different types of RHSs should be incorporated into the development of transportation policies in Southeast Asian cities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Local Context; Mode Choice; Motorcycle-based Society; Ride-hailing Service; Car Ownership; Ownership; Questionnaire Survey; Traffic Congestion; Transport Vehicle; Travel Time; Hanoi; Viet Nam","car ownership; ownership; questionnaire survey; traffic congestion; transport vehicle; travel time; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This study was financially supported by a Kajima Foundation’s International Joint Research Grant.","Mobility on Demand Operational Concept Report, (2017); Shen, Hui, Modeling travel mode choice of young people with differentiated E-hailing ride services in Nanjing China, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 78, (2020); Ma, Ye, Spatial heterogeneous characteristics of ridesharing in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region of China, Energies, 11, 11, (2018); Acheampong, Ransford A., Mobility-on-demand: An empirical study of internet-based ride-hailing adoption factors, travel characteristics and mode substitution effects, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 115, (2020); Giddy, Julia Kathryn, The influence of e-hailing apps on urban mobilities in South Africa, African Geographical Review, 38, 3, pp. 227-239, (2019); Tirachini, Alejandro, Ride-hailing, travel behaviour and sustainable mobility: an international review, Transportation, 47, 4, pp. 2011-2047, (2020); Chalermpong, Saksith, Bangkok, Thailand, pp. 207-227, (2019); de Sa, Ana Luiza Santos, Methodological proposal for stated preference scenarios regarding an exploratory evaluation of ride-hailing implications on transit: A Brazilian context analysis, Case Studies on Transport Policy, 9, 4, pp. 1727-1736, (2021); Khattak, Zulqarnain H., Ride-hailing and taxi versus walking: Long term forecasts and implications from large-scale behavioral data, Journal of Transport and Health, 22, (2021); Kang, Shuqing, Pooled versus private ride-hailing: A joint revealed and stated preference analysis recognizing psycho-social factors, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 124, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122505437"

Bio-sponge and bio-cloth reactors showed removal of COD (79 vs. 76%) and NH<inf>4</inf>+–N (78 vs. 73%). While bio-cord treatment was deteriorated due to time-dependent process. Multiple linear regression revealed that alkalinity governed the formation degree of the anaerobic zone in bio-sponges, partially affecting nitrification. Increasing IR from 1 to 3 caused sloughing of the attached biomass and was positively correlated with effluent nitrite nitrogen concentration, indicating the sensitivity of nitrification to spatial distribution effects.

As a result, huge amounts of depleted uranium must be stockpiled and stored. Fast reactors operating in breed-and-burn (B&B) conditions are one potential approach to reducing the need for storage facilities to hold spent nuclear fuel and maximize the effective use of uranium resources. Sustaining B&B operating conditions depends on the choice of core materials. Here, we perform neutron balance analyses to determine the best combination of fuel and coolant material. We identify the features of the reactor core needed to maintain B&B operating mode by the amount of neutron loss from the core and coolant heat removal capability. Finally, we demonstrate that a large or small sodium-cooled fast reactor core with metallic or enriched nitride fuel, respectively, can sustain the chain reaction and B&B operation mode. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","B&b; Breed-and-burn Reactor; Core Material Combination; Neutron Balance; Coolants; Coremaking; Nuclear Fuels; Nuclear Power Plants; Sodium; Uranium; Breed And Burns; Breed-and-burn Reactor; Core Material; Core Material Combination; Depleted Uranium; Enriched Uranium; Material Combination; Neutron Balance; Thermal Reactors; Neutrons","Coolants; Coremaking; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Sodium; Uranium; Breed and burns; Breed-and-burn reactor; Core material; Core material combination; Depleted uranium; Enriched uranium; Material combination; Neutron balance; Thermal reactors; Neutrons","","","This work was supported by the Tech World Research Hub Initiative (WRHI) Program of the Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and by the Foundation for Science and Technology of Mongolia under grant number 2018/45, and by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.04-2019.37.","Power Reactor Information System Pris, (2025); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, CANDLE: The new burnup strategy, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 139, 3, pp. 306-317, (2001); Arwif 2001, (2001); Light A Candle, (2010); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, Application of CANDLE burnup strategy for future nuclear energy utilization, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 47, 1-4, pp. 91-98, (2005); Hejzlar, Pavel, Terrapower, LLC traveling wave reactor development program overview, Nuclear Engineering and Technology, 45, 6, pp. 731-744, (2013); Ellis, Tyler, Traveling-wave reactors: A truly sustainable and full-scale resource for global energy needs, 1, pp. 546-558, (2010); Heidet, Florent, Neutron balance analysis for sustainability of breed-and-burn reactors, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 171, 1, pp. 13-31, (2012); Heidet, Florent, Breed-and-burn depleted uranium in fast reactors without actinides separation, 2, pp. 1661-1673, (2010); Greenspan, Ehud, Energy sustainability and economic stability with Breed and Burn reactors, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 53, 7, pp. 794-799, (2011)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","00295639; 1943748X","","NSENA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116338072"

Hence, determining the generation characteristics of PV systems has been becoming a crucial task in planning and dispatching the power system. However, since the generation of PV systems is profoundly impacted by the weather conditions, especially the irradiance and the temperature, producing a PV model, which performs well at various conditions, has been a challenging task for years. In this paper, we present a model to determine the PV generation characteristics by obtaining the current-voltage (I–V) curves of the single-diode model. First, the three key points, including the open-circuit point, the short-circuit point, and the maximum power point, are estimated from the historical data based on an improved regression model. After that, a new algorithm is proposed, which ensures the model always converges at any temperature and irradiance conditions. The proposed model is validated by comparing with recently published models and the measured data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA. Compared to previous numerical models, the proposed model is capable of determining the generation characteristics of PV systems at anomaly conditions (anomalously low irradiance and anomalously high irradiance) with high accuracy and fast speed. The validated results demonstrate the accuracy and the reliability of the proposed model in determining the generation characteristics of PV modules at real-time conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diodes; Regression Analysis; Renewable Energy Resources; Condition; Photovoltaic Model; Photovoltaic Systems; Photovoltaics Generations; Power; Real- Time; Renewable Power Generation; Single-diode Models; Sustainable Energy Systems; Time Condition; Photovoltaic Cells","Diodes; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Condition; Photovoltaic model; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics generations; Power; Real- time; Renewable power generation; Single-diode models; Sustainable energy systems; Time condition; Photovoltaic cells","","","This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2020‐SAHEP‐005.","Advances in Grid Connected Photovoltaic Power Conversion Systems, (2019); Villalva, Marcelo Gradella, Comprehensive approach to modeling and simulation of photovoltaic arrays, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 24, 5, pp. 1198-1208, (2009); Lo Brano, Valerio, An improved five-parameter model for photovoltaic modules, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 94, 8, pp. 1358-1370, (2010); Wang, Gang, An iterative approach for modeling photovoltaic modules without implicit equations, Applied Energy, 202, pp. 189-198, (2017); Orioli, Aldo, An accurate one-diode model suited to represent the current-voltage characteristics of crystalline and thin-film photovoltaic modules, Renewable Energy, 145, pp. 725-743, (2020); Ghani, F., Numerical determination of parasitic resistances of a solar cell using the Lambert W-function, Solar Energy, 85, 9, pp. 2386-2394, (2011); Ghani, F., Numerical calculation of series and shunt resistances and diode quality factor of a photovoltaic cell using the Lambert W-function, Solar Energy, 91, pp. 422-431, (2013); Cubas, Javier, On the analytical approach for modeling photovoltaic systems behavior, Journal of Power Sources, 247, pp. 467-474, (2014); Laudani, Antonino, Identification of the one-diode model for photovoltaic modules from datasheet values, Solar Energy, 108, pp. 432-446, (2014); Hussein, Ahmed, A simple approach to extract the unknown parameters of PV modules, Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, 25, 5, pp. 4431-4444, (2017)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","17521424; 17521416","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115845343"

The results quantified the impact of major core design choices on the criticality of a core that uses sodium as a coolant material and HT9 steel as structural material. The design variables examined include the binary metallic fuel U-Zr with different weight percentages of zirconium as well as different core heights and fuel rod pitch-to-diameter ratios (P/Ds) in the fuel assembly. We found that a core using the binary metallic fuel U-Zr with 2 wt% zirconium, with a core height of 200 cm, a P/D of 1.086, and a core power of 400 MW(thermal), could overcome some major design constraints. It was also found that with shuffling intervals of 1125 to 1250 days, the core with rotational fuel shuffling was critical in the equilibrium state, and the possible average discharged burnup was from 274.8 to 305.3 GWd/ton HM. Reactor characteristics such as neutron flux and power profile were almost stable during the equilibrium cycle. A steady-state thermal-hydraulic analysis was performed for the hottest channel in the core. It revealed that both the fuel and cladding maximum temperatures were less than the melting point of the fuel and the chemical interaction temperature of the HT-9, respectively. The mixed coolant outlet temperature was somewhat below the temperature usually observed in sodium-cooled fast reactors. Thus, it appears that the S-PRISM can be principally designed to have a B&B core. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Reactor; Breed-and-burn Reactor; Rotational Fuel Shuffling; S-prism Core Design; Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor; Binary Alloys; Coolants; Metal Fuels; Prisms; Uranium Alloys; Zircaloy; Zirconium; Chemical Interactions; Design Constraints; Maximum Temperature; Mode Of Operations; Outlet Temperature; Pitch-to-diameter Ratios; Thermal-hydraulic Analysis; Weight Percentages; Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors","Binary alloys; Coolants; Metal fuels; Prisms; Uranium alloys; Zircaloy; Zirconium; Chemical interactions; Design constraints; Maximum temperature; Mode of operations; Outlet temperature; Pitch-to-diameter ratios; Thermal-hydraulic analysis; Weight percentages; Sodium-cooled fast reactors","","","This work was supported by the Tokyo Tech World Research Hub Initiative (WRHI) Program of the Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology; by the Foundation for Science and Technology of Mongolia under grant number 2018/45; and by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.04-2019.37.","Rec of Proc Session B 10 Icpuae, (1958); Proceedings of Physor 2010, (2010); Heidet, Florent, Neutron balance analysis for sustainability of breed-and-burn reactors, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 171, 1, pp. 13-31, (2012); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, A new reactor burnup concept “candle”, (2000); Gilleland, John, Novel reactor designs to burn non-fissile fuels, 4, pp. 2278-2284, (2008); Proc Int Conf Fast Reactors and Related Fuel Cycles Next Generation Nuclear Systems for Sustainable Development Fr17, (2017); Kuwagaki, Kazuki, Concept of Stationary Wave Reactor with Rotational Fuel Shuffling, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 191, 2, pp. 178-186, (2018); Maximum Fuel Utilization in Fast Reactors Without Chemical Reprocessing Project no 09 769; Advanced Burner Reactor with Breed and Burn Thorium Blankets for Improved Economics and Resource Utilization Project no 12 3486; Proceedings of ICONE 8 8th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, (2000)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","00295639; 1943748X","","NSENA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111816005"

This research contributes to the existing literature by investigating the impact of energy transition progress on power consumption in Asian countries. The models' estimations are carried out by the system generalized method of moments (GMM) panel estimator for 35 Asian countries throughout 2000–2017. The major findings confirm that energy transition (migration from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources) positively impacts the electricity consumption of high- and upper-middle-income Asian countries. Furthermore, our results highlight that the sensitivity of electricity consumption in middle- and lower-middle-income Asian countries to inflation, electricity pricing, and population growth is higher than in high- and upper-middle-income Asian countries. The conclusion is that the electricity-energy transition nexus is highly sensitive to countries’ income levels and macroeconomic stability. This implies that Asian countries with different income levels need to first improve economic sustainability and resilience, followed by fossil fuel-to-green energy switch policies and technological efficiency in the power generation sector. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian Regions; Energy Transition; Power Electric Consumption; Sustainable Development; Climate Change; Economics; Energy Efficiency; Energy Policy; Fossil Fuels; Method Of Moments; Population Statistics; Renewable Energy Resources; Sustainable Development; Asian Countries; Asian Region; Electric Consumption; Electricity-consumption; Energies (power); Energy Transitions; Income Levels; Middle Incomes; Power; Power Electric; Electric Power Utilization; Alternative Energy; Climate Change; Electricity; Energy Efficiency; Energy Policy; Energy Use; Income; Panel Data; Population Growth; Power Generation; Sustainability; Asia","Climate change; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Method of moments; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Asian countries; Asian region; Electric consumption; Electricity-consumption; Energies (power); Energy transitions; Income levels; Middle incomes; Power; Power electric; Electric power utilization; alternative energy; climate change; electricity; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; income; panel data; population growth; power generation; sustainability; Asia","","","Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary acknowledges the financial support of the JSPS KAKENHI (2019–2020) Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists No. 19K13742 and Grant-in-Aid for Excellent Young Researcher of the Ministry of Education of Japan ( MEXT ).

For such systems, we first derive a lower bound on the achievable secrecy rate of each user. Next, the total power consumption for illumination and data transmission is thoroughly analyzed. We then tackle the problem of maximizing energy efficiency, given that each user's secrecy rate satisfies a certain threshold. The design problem is shown to be non-convex fractional programming, which renders finding the optimal solution computationally prohibitive. Our aim in this paper is, therefore, to find sub-optimal yet low complexity solutions. For this purpose, the traditional Dinkelbach algorithm is first employed to reformulate the original problem to a non-fractional parameterized one. Two different approaches based on the convex-concave procedure (CCCP) and Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) are utilized to solve the non-convex parameterized problem. In addition, to further reduce the complexity, we investigate a design using the zero-forcing (ZF) technique.

This rapid growth has been accompanied by an increased energy demand per capita. Ground source heat pumps could be a solution to improve energy efficiency. However, there are several concerns with the introduction of this technology. Unlike in four-season countries, where a seasonal balance between cooling and heating demand exists, the use of ground source heat pumps in Southeast Asia is primarily for cooling. The temperature difference between the ground and air is also small. In this paper, we evaluate the first thermal response test results ever performed in Southeast Asia at sites in Bangkok and Hanoi. Borehole heat exchanger models were established on the basis of the apparent thermal conductivities according to the thermal response test results. The borehole heat exchanger models were then used to evaluate the five-year performance of a ground source heat pump in a typical small-sized detached office building under specific climatic conditions. The increasing borehole heat exchanger temperature is unavoidable because of the absence of heat extraction. Consequently, the coefficient of performance decreasing, along with the increasing power consumption, over time. Yet, the results indicating that the ground source heat pump can still provide good thermal performance. We also evaluated the effect of the number of boreholes on the ground source heat pump performance. The results indicate that the maximum coefficient of performance can be relatively improved by 16.1% and 14.9% in Bangkok and Hanoi, respectively, using 10 instead of 6 boreholes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ground Source Heat Pump; Southeast Asia; Space Cooling; Thermal Response Test; Cooling; Economics; Energy Efficiency; Geothermal Heat Pumps; Office Buildings; Pumps; Thermal Conductivity; Bangkok; Borehole Heat Exchangers; Coefficient Of Performance; Groundsource Heat Pump (gshp); Heat Exchanger Model; On Potentials; Southeast Asia; Space Cooling; Thermal Response Test; Vertical Ground Heat Exchangers; Boreholes","Cooling; Economics; Energy efficiency; Geothermal heat pumps; Office buildings; Pumps; Thermal conductivity; Bangkok; Borehole heat exchangers; Coefficient of Performance; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); Heat exchanger model; On potentials; Southeast Asia; Space cooling; Thermal response test; Vertical ground heat exchangers; Boreholes","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, The Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researcher (LEADER).Coordinating Committee for Geoscience Program in East and Southeast Asia (CCOP), Groundwater Sub-Project.Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKENHI (Grant number: 19H02655)","Ahmad, Azman, Electricity consumption in Brunei Darussalam: Challenges in energy conservation, International Energy Journal, 14, 4, pp. 155-166, (2014); Bakirtas, Tahsin, The relationship between energy consumption, urbanization, and economic growth in new emerging-market countries, Energy, 147, pp. 110-121, (2018); Proceedings of the 5th International Building Physics Conference Ibpc, (2012); De Rosa, Mattia, A novel TRNSYS type for short-term borehole heat exchanger simulation: B2G model, Energy Conversion and Management, 100, pp. 347-357, (2015); Doan, Vanquang, Projections of urban climate in the 2050s in a fast-growing city in Southeast Asia: The greater Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area, Vietnam, International Journal of Climatology, 38, 11, pp. 4155-4171, (2018); Peer Review on Energy Efficiency in Brunei Darussalam, (2013); Fujii, Hikari, An improved thermal response test for U-tube ground heat exchanger based on optical fiber thermometers, Geothermics, 38, 4, pp. 399-406, (2009); Duct Ground Heat Storage Model Manual for Computer Code, (1989); Jonas, Danny, A TRNSYS-based simulation framework for the analysis of solar thermal and heat pump systems, Applied Solar Energy (English translation of Geliotekhnika), 53, 2, pp. 126-137, (2017); World Air Conditioner Demand by Region, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524847","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122812690"

This work investigates the fabrication of bioinspired photothermal (BIPT) material by sputtering a copper layer on Phanera purpurea (PP) leaf for application in SSG systems. It is observed that the light absorbance of the BIPT material exceeds 92% in the wavelength region of 300–2500 nm. This is due to the light trapping effect caused by multi-internal reflection inside the Cu-coated leaf nanostructure. The BIPT material exhibits a low thermal conductivity and easy cleaning properties as a result of PP leaf surface features. A novel strategy in this work is the design of the BIPT material-based SSG system to recycle the radiative heat loss for evaporation. The developed SSG system results in a solar steam efficiency of 83.7% and a water evaporation rate of 1.45 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun. It is also applied in seawater desalination and the produced water satisfies the WHO standards for ion concentrations in clean water. Because of the simple procedure and low cost, the sputtering Cu on the PP leaf can be potentially used in the mass production of BIPT material for seawater desalination. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Copper Thin Film; Nanostructures; Photothermal Biomaterials; Seawater Desalination; Solar Steam Generation; Costs; Desalination; Evaporation; Seawater; Steam Generators; Cleaning Properties; Internal Reflections; Ion Concentrations; Light Trapping Effects; Low Thermal Conductivity; Radiative Heat Loss; Seawater Desalination; Wavelength Regions; Nanostructures","Costs; Desalination; Evaporation; Seawater; Steam generators; Cleaning properties; Internal reflections; Ion concentrations; Light trapping effects; Low thermal conductivity; Radiative heat loss; Seawater desalination; Wavelength regions; Nanostructures","","","T.T.P. and T.D.D. contributed equally to this work.

The main idea behind 1M5R is the use of good-quality/certified seeds (the One Must Do) as well as the reduction of seed rates, pesticide use, fertilizer inputs, water use, and postharvest losses (Five Reductions). However, the impact of these farming practices is not well understood. This study employs the propensity score matching (PSM) approach to investigate the factors that affect the adoption of the 1M5R practice and to estimate this technique's impact on the economic performance of rice cultivation. Primary data were collected through a household survey of 380 rice farms in four provinces in the Mekong Delta (MKD), Vietnam. The results indicate that adopting the 1M5R technique is significantly correlated with the educational level of household heads, their memberships in paddy cooperatives, and their attendance to previous training classes. Additionally, the 1M5R technical package helps farmers to reduce their production cost by 10%, increase a paddy's selling price by 4.5% per kg, and obtain 10% more profit, compared to traditional farming households. The return on investment for adopters increased by 22%. While the findings show that a sustainable farming technique is advantageous to local farmers, they fail to present any paddy yield increase in treatment fields. To scale up this program to other areas in the MKD, well-educated farmers who are still traditional producers/non-adopters should be positively invited for training classes of the program. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Performance; Five Reductions”; Mekong Delta; Propensity Score Matching; Rice Smallholder; “one Must Do; Agricultural Robots; Cultivation; Profitability; Regional Planning; Surveys; Agriculture And Rural; Best Management Practices; Economic Performance; Educational Levels; Household Surveys; Post-harvest Loss; Propensity Score Matching; Sustainable Farming; Costs","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Profitability; Regional planning; Surveys; Agriculture and rural; Best management practices; Economic performance; Educational levels; Household surveys; Post-harvest loss; Propensity score matching; Sustainable Farming; Costs","","","We would like to express our appreciation to the Mekong Delta Development Research Institute's director and the leader of the MSVC project for their consent to acquire and use the dataset for analysis.

This study identified 10 constraints on implementing good management practices designed to improve the health and productivity of pig production, ensure the health of workers, reduce environmental pollution and allow customers to trace the origins of their products, collectively known as Good Animal Husbandry Practices. Low output price and lack of capital were identified as the key constraints faced by 42.8% and 28.3% of farmers, respectively. Furthermore, specialized production was found to mitigate these two constraints in terms of income contribution, whereas access to credit was found to exacerbate them. Lack of knowledge was the only constraint perceived to be more severe by non-VietGAHP farmers than by their VietGAHP counterparts. Based on the above results for both VietGAHP and non-VietGAHP farmers, these constraints need to be addressed by improving financial situations through formal credit and focusing on specialized pig-producing households.

A series of batch adsorption experiments was carried out in single and binary‐metal solutions of Cd2+ and Pb2+ by changing the mixing proportions of SS and AAC grains. In addition, the effect of the liquid‐to‐solid ratio (L/S) on the removal of Cd2+ and Pb2+ in multi‐metal solution was examined. Results showed that SS grains had a high affinity with Cd2+ in the single solution, while AAC grains had an affinity with Pb2+. In the binary solution, the mixtures of SS and AAC grains removed both Cd2+ and Pb2+ well; especially, the tested adsorbents of SS+AAC [1:1] and SS+AAC [1:4] mixtures achieved approximately 100% removal of both metals. Based on the results in the multi‐metal solutions, the metal removal % and selectivity sequence varied depending on the mixed proportions of SS and AAC grains and L/S values. It was found that the SS+AAC [1:1] mixture of SS and AAC grains showed 100% removals of Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ simultaneously at L/S = 10 and 60. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (aac); Heavy Metals; Industrial By‐products; Metal Adsorption; Selectivity Sequence; Steel Slag (ss); Wastewater; Adsorption; Cation; Concentration (composition); Concrete; Detection Method; Experimental Study; Pollutant Removal; Slag; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment","adsorption; cation; concentration (composition); concrete; detection method; experimental study; pollutant removal; slag; wastewater; wastewater treatment","","","This research was funded by JST‐JICA Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) Project (No. JPMJSA1701).","Petrella, Andrea, Heavy metals retention (Pb(II), Cd(II), Ni(II)) from single and multimetal solutions by natural biosorbents from the olive oil milling operations, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 114, pp. 79-90, (2018); Roshanfekr Rad, Leila Roshanfekr, Removal of Ni2+ and Cd2+ ions from aqueous solutions using electrospun PVA/zeolite nanofibrous adsorbent, Chemical Engineering Journal, 256, pp. 119-127, (2014); Sellaoui, Lotfi, Interpretation of single and competitive adsorption of cadmium and zinc on activated carbon using monolayer and exclusive extended monolayer models, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24, 24, pp. 19902-19908, (2017); Demey, Hary, A novel algal-based sorbent for heavy metal removal, Chemical Engineering Journal, 332, pp. 582-595, (2018); Singh, Om Vir, Phytoremediation: An overview of metallic ion decontamination from soil, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 61, 5-6, pp. 405-412, (2003); Duan, Qiannan, Distribution of Heavy Metal Pollution in Surface Soil Samples in China: A Graphical Review, Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 97, 3, pp. 303-309, (2016); Wu, Gang, A critical review on the bio-removal of hazardous heavy metals from contaminated soils: Issues, progress, eco-environmental concerns and opportunities, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 174, 1-3, pp. 1-8, (2010); Elouear, Zouhair, Removal of nickel and cadmium from aqueous solutions by sewage sludge ash: Study in single and binary systems, Environmental Technology (United Kingdom), 30, 6, pp. 561-570, (2009); Pourrut, Bertrand, Lead-induced DNA damage in Vicia faba root cells: Potential involvement of oxidative stress, Mutation Research - Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis, 726, 2, pp. 123-128, (2011); Fu, Fenglian, Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 92, 3, pp. 407-418, (2011)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115192540"

Basic information on seven CDW landfills under operation or closed/abandoned was collected, and the waste composition and the grain size distributions of dumped CDW at two landfills were investigated. Results showed that only one landfill site is currently under operation in Hanoi. Sanitary conditions of investigated landfills were relatively good without dumping of hazardous waste. Illegal dumping of domestic waste from residents, however, could be observed more or less at all sites due to an unclear boundary between dumping and surrounding areas. To improve current management of CDW landfills, a suitable recording system of accepted/dumped CDW and technical support for site managers are required as well as the implementation plan for developing and renovating landfills. Based on the results of the waste composition survey, the major components of dumped CDW were “Concrete”, “Clay bricks”, and “Soil-like”, and the sum of these materials reached >80% of the total. Grain size distributions of “Concrete” ranged from 10–600 mm and of “Clay bricks” ranged from 10–300 mm. Technical recommendations to examine a potential availability of dumped “Concrete” and “Clay bricks” as a base material in road construction are summarized from the viewpoints of segregation from “Soil-like” and impurities, grading of “Concrete” and “Clay bricks”, mechanical properties and environmental safety, and economic feasibility.

Although industrial activity is rapidly expanding, production practices to increase material circularity and reduce environmental impact have yet to see sufficient progress. This article analyses the environmental benefits of implementing a regionally based co-processing scheme between the iron-steel and cement industries of three emergent South-East Asian economies: Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Vietnam, already ranked as the 8th largest cement producer, can be a crucial contributor to a more symbiotic exchange of wastes with regional neighbours. A plan to increase the co-processed iron/steel slag at cement facilities (from 1 to 10 per cent) would translate into substantial gains in material circularity (0.83–8.33 M. tons of raw material savings per year) and carbon emission reductions in the region (0.95–9.07 Mt CO<inf>2</inf>, i.e. 1.6 to 15.6 per cent of business as usual scenarios equal to reductions of 6 per cent of the total emissions). This scheme could provide further benefits over a nationally self-oriented strategy, revealed by the levels of material exchange within the countries. However, several considerations are essential to make such a scheme feasible. We discuss these critical factors, which are fundamental for a prospective join industrialisation strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cambodia; Cement; Circular Economy; Co-processing; Industrial Symbiosis; Laos; Slag; South-east Asia; Vietnam; Cement Industry; Cements; Economics; Emission Control; Steelmaking; Cambodia; Circular Economy; Coprocessing; Economic Growth Rate; Industrial Symbiosis; Iron Steels; Lao; Regional Co; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; Slags","Cement industry; Cements; Economics; Emission control; Steelmaking; Cambodia; Circular economy; Coprocessing; Economic growth rate; Industrial symbiosis; Iron steels; Lao; Regional CO; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; Slags","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Randy Muth for his comments and suggestions and the reviewers, who significantly improved the quality of this article.

However, Vietnamese rice farmers face several challenges, including pressures to develop sustainable livelihoods while reducing the environmental impacts of their production activities. Various Vietnamese agricultural restructuring policies were promulgated to promote the adoption of environmentally friendly practices to generate high value added for rice farmers, but the farmers are reluctant to adopt them because of perceived lack of demand. Decreasing consumption of rice in Asia and increasing demands in Europe shaped Vietnamese rice exporting policies. New trade agreements, such as the UK–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, offer new target markets for Vietnamese rice farmers. This research provides empirical evidence related to the preferences of UK consumers for ethical attributes for floating rice imported from Vietnam. Floating rice represents a traditional method of rice cultivation that relies on the natural flooding cycle. Its cultivation uses very few agrochemical inputs and provides several other environmental, economic, and social benefits. In an online survey, the study used a choice experiment that asked 306 UK consumers to report their preferences for one kilo of floating rice with three non-market attributes: Reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, allocation of profits to the farmers, and restitution of biodiversity. Overall, study participants favored the attributes of floating rice, but reported utility for only the “fair trade” attribute and for a marginal willingness to pay premiums for profit allocations to farmers. Consumers did not find value in either CO2 emission reduction or biodiversity improvement. Results from the study provide recommendations to develop agricultural programs, distribution strategies, and informational methods to encourage floating rice consumption in the UK. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Policy; Agriculture In International Trade; Biodiversity; Carbon Footprint; Fair Trade; Food Policy; Government Policy; Greenhouse Gas Reduction; Valuation Of Environmental Effects; Value Chain Agri-food; Agrochemical; Alternative Agriculture; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Cultivation; Ethics; Food Consumption; Food Market; Food Security; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; Willingness To Pay; Asia; Europe; United Kingdom; Viet Nam","agrochemical; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; carbon dioxide; cultivation; ethics; food consumption; food market; food security; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; willingness to pay; Asia; Europe; United Kingdom; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This study was funded by RONPAKU, JSPS (ID number R11616), The Konosuke Matsushita Memorial Foundation (ID number 17-056), and by a grant from the Global Engagement Office of Sam M.

Therefore, the economic operation of MGs plays a vital role in reducing total daily costs and greenhouse gas emissions in the modern power system. This study presents a day-ahead optimization management for a grid-tied MG supplied by small-scale renewable energy sources (RESs) like photovoltaic (PV) systems. The major aim of the suggested optimal energy management system is to minimize the cost of RERs and storage facilities in the MG for power generation while satisfying technical constraints. In addition, an improved mathematical model is suggested for the PV power generation using real data for four dissimilar days. To attain accurate results, uncertainties in the generations, load demand, and market price are probabilistically modeled. To handle the optimization problem, the θ-modified krill herd (θ-MKH) algorithm is used. The suggested algorithm for solving the optimization problem is investigated on numerical examples with different RESs and storages in the MG and compared with conventional approaches. The results attained illustrate that the recommended algorithm can utilize the cheapest sources while covering technical constraints. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative Energy Sources; Energy Conversion/systems; Energy Storage Systems; Microgrid; Photovoltaic; Power (co-)generation; Renewable Energy; Resource Scheduling; Stochastic Programming; Θ-mkh Algorithm; Digital Storage; Electromagnetic Wave Emission; Energy Management; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Microgrids; Optimization; Renewable Energy Resources; Solar Power Generation; Algorithm For Solving; Conventional Approach; Distributed Generations (dgs); Optimization Managements; Optimization Problems; Photovoltaic Systems; Renewable Energy Source; Technical Constraints; Energy Management Systems","Digital storage; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Microgrids; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Algorithm for solving; Conventional approach; Distributed generations (DGs); Optimization managements; Optimization problems; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy source; Technical constraints; Energy management systems","","","","Vu Quynh, Nguyen, Optimal energy management strategy for a renewable-based microgrid considering sizing of battery energy storage with control policies, International Journal of Energy Research, 45, 4, pp. 5766-5780, (2021); Vahedi, Hesan, Optimal management of microgrid using differential evolution approach, (2010); Yin, Nan, A day-ahead joint energy management and battery sizing framework based on θ-modified krill herd algorithm for a renewable energy-integrated microgrid, Journal of Cleaner Production, 282, (2021); Rabiee, Abdorreza, Modified imperialist competitive algorithm for environmental constrained energy management of microgrids, Journal of Cleaner Production, 202, pp. 273-292, (2018); Ahmed, Emad M., Multifunctional distributed MPPT controller for 3P4W grid-connected PV systems in distribution network with unbalanced loads, Energies, 12, 24, (2019); Khaksar, Mehrdad, Simulation of novel hybrid method to improve dynamic responses with PSS and UPFC by fuzzy logic controller, Neural Computing and Applications, 29, 3, pp. 837-853, (2018); Dadfar, Sajjad, Enhanced control strategies for a hybrid battery/photovoltaic system using FGS-PID in grid-connected mode, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 44, 29, pp. 14642-14660, (2019); Mahmoud, Karar, Improved salp-swarm optimizer and accurate forecasting model for dynamic economic dispatch in sustainable power systems, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 2, (2020); Izadbakhsh, Maziar, Dynamic response improvement of hybrid system by implementing ANN-GA for fast variation of photovoltaic irradiation and FLC for wind turbine, Archives of Electrical Engineering, 64, 2, pp. 291-314, (2015); Pan, Zhen, Enhancement of maximum power point tracking technique based on PV-Battery system using hybrid BAT algorithm and fuzzy controller, Journal of Cleaner Production, 274, (2020)","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","","","","","","01950738; 15288994","","JERTD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107880720"

Because surimi-based paste contains water and salts, the conductivity is sufficiently good for the ohmic effect. Gelation induced by OH greatly depends on heating conditions such as heating speed, heating time or electrical conductivity. However, the detailed information obtained is quite limited. Therefore, in order to clarify how ohmic heating affects the physical properties of surimi gel under OH, gels from croaker surimi (SA grade) were obtained using different heating conditions (heating rate, heating time, or salt concentration-electrical conductivity). Furthermore, the gels heated by ohmic heating were compared with the gel obtained by conventional water-bath heating. The results showed that, at the same heating rates, higher salt concentration generated better surimi gels for croaker surimi. Gels cooked ohmically at a slow heating rate performed significantly better than those cooked at a fast heating rate or heated conventionally in a water bath. There was little discernible difference in protein pattern between gels heated by OH and conventional water bath heating at fast heating rates with two different salt concentrations. The results also indicated that holding time at target temperature showed no effect on the gel. These results suggested that the properties of heat-induced surimi gels by OH were affected by not only heating speed but also holding time at maximum temperature and salt content. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrical Conductivity; Heating Rate; Ohmic Heating; Physical Properties; Surimi Gel","","","","","Benjakul, Soottawat, Transglutaminase-mediated setting in bigeye snapper Surimi, Food Research International, 36, 3, pp. 253-266, (2003); Benjakul, Soottawat, Suwari gel properties as affected by transglutaminase activator and inhibitors, Food Chemistry, 85, 1, pp. 91-99, (2004); de Alwis, Ajith A.P., Shape and conductivity effects in the ohmic heating of foods, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 67, 2, pp. 159-168, (1989); de Alwis, Ajith A.P., Operability of the ohmic heating process: Electrical conductivity effects, Journal of Food Engineering, 15, 1, pp. 21-48, (1992); FRYER, PETER J., Ohmic processing of solid-liquid mixtures: Heat generation and convection effects, Journal of Food Engineering, 18, 2, pp. 101-125, (1993); Huang, Lihan, Coagulation of fish proteins from frozen fish mince wash water by ohmic heating, Journal of Food Process Engineering, 20, 4, pp. 285-300, (1997); Kamath, G.

The increase in food waste has serious negative impacts on environmental sustainability, water and land resources, and food security, as well as climate and greenhouse gas emissions. Through a specific case study in Da Nang City, Vietnam, this paper examines the extent of food waste generation at the consumption stages, the eating habits of consumers, food waste from households and service establishments, as well as prospects for the reuse of food waste as pig feed. The results of this study indicate that per capita food waste generation in Da Nang has increased from 0.39 to 0.41kg in 2016, 0.46 in 2017, and reached 0.52kg in 2018. According to the results of our consumer survey, 20% of respondents stated that they often generate food waste, 67% stated they sometimes do, and 13% stated they rarely do. Furthermore, 66% of surveyed households stated that their food waste is collected and transported by pig farmers to be used as feed for pigs. The use of food waste as feed for pigs is a typical feature in Da Nang. The study also found that there is a high level of consumer awareness and willingness to participate in the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) program, which was being initiated by the city government. In service facilities such as resorts and hotels, daily food waste reached 100–200 kg in large facilities and 20–120 kg in small facilities. This waste was also collected for use in pig farming. However, there has been a fall in demand for pig feed in line with a decrease in the number of pig farms due to the African swine fever epidemic that occurred during the implementation of this study. This paper suggests that there is a strong need to take both consumer-oriented waste prevention and waste management measures, such as waste segregation at source and introduction of effective food waste recycling techniques, to ensure that food waste can be safely and sustainably used as a “valuable resource” rather than “wasted.”. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3rs Program; Landscape Sustainability; Municipal Solid Waste; Pig Farming; Resource Circulation; Resource Use Efficiency; Urban–rural Nexus; Zero-waste Lifestyle; Consumption Behavior; Environmental Impact; Food Security; Food Waste; Greenhouse Gas; Megacity; Recycling; Resource Use; Sustainability; Waste Management; Da Nang; Viet Nam","consumption behavior; environmental impact; food security; food waste; greenhouse gas; megacity; recycling; resource use; sustainability; waste management; Da Nang; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) under the Strategic Research Fund 2019?2020; and supported by the Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund (S16) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan under the project entitled: ?Policy Design and Evaluation to Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns in Asian Region?

The floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) operates under many influences such as both the aerodynamic force, the hydrodynamic force and coupled motion between the two. Therefore, in this paper about the effect of collective pitch control and cyclic pitch control on power and loads of FOWT are discussed under the uniform wind velocity of 10 m/s with wind tunnel and numerical investigation. FAST tool (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) is used to simulate FOWT under the same wind conditions as wind tunnel experiments. A two-bladed downwind turbine model is used for this experiment to estimate the fluctuations of the power coefficient, thrust coefficient and moments. The pitch moment and the yaw moment are measured at the top of the tower and the fluctuation of loads is compared. The phase angle of the pitch angle is controlled by three actuators through a swash plate equipment. From the simulated results, the effect of the pitch angle change on the power coefficient is higher than the yaw angle change. For the yawed wind condition, the load of the wind turbine at the phase angle of ξ = 60° was equal to the optimum operating point.

Hydroxyapatite particles (HA) were synthesized from striped catfish (Pagasianodon hypophthalmus) bone and surface modified by grafting with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). Important factors affected grafting efficiency such as concentration of APTES, water content, reaction temperature and reaction time were studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to confirm the grafting reaction on HA surfaces. Grafting efficiency was evaluated based on intensity of characteristic absorption peaks of APTES. The experimental results showed that amine functional groups were successfully introduced on HA surface at optimal condition of 0.2 M APTES, 0.75 wt.% water content, at 60°C and 12-hour reaction time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane; Biocompatible Materials; Catfish Bone; Hydroxyapatite","","","","This study is funded in part by the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14-P6, supported by a Japanese ODA loan (Grant No.:F4-4).","Balasundaram, Ganesan, Using hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and decreased crystallinity to promote osteoblast adhesion similar to functionalizing with RGD, Biomaterials, 27, 14, pp. 2798-2805, (2006); Barakat, Nasser A.M., Extraction of pure natural hydroxyapatite from the bovine bones bio waste by three different methods, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 209, 7, pp. 3408-3415, (2009); Boerio, F.

The binary logit model was applied to analyze data collected by face-to-face interviews with 110 households in Phu Vang Coastal District, Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The findings indicate that most farmers accurately perceived climate-related changes during the recent decade, and implemented various adaptation measures in an effort to alleviate the potential risks. Adaptations included changing crop varieties, adjusting farming calendar, diversifying crops, diversifying livestock, improving irrigation, and intensifying soil quality. In addition, the farming household adaptation decisions were positively affected by gender, education level, number of laborers, income level, involvement in local community organizations, and perception of climate change severity and adaptation measure efficacy. Farmer adaptations, in contrast, were negatively influenced by non-farm income and entirely unaffected by access to credit. Policy-related recommendations were proposed to encourage smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change in the region. Recommendations included (1) improvements in the understanding of climate change, especially for female and less educated farmers; (2) more attention paid to the activities of local community organizations to be more attractive for members; (3) participation in the non-agricultural sector in parallel with implementing climate change adaptation measures in agriculture; (4) preferential loans designed as targets for low-income households combined with strict management to avoid misuse by beneficiaries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation Decision; Central Vietnam; Climate Change; Phu Vang District; Smallholder Farmers","","","","","Al-amin, Abul Quasem, Analysing the socioeconomic and motivational factors affecting the willingness to pay for climate change adaptation in Malaysia, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 50, (2020); Alam, GM Monirul, Climate change perceptions and local adaptation strategies of hazard-prone rural households in Bangladesh, Climate Risk Management, 17, pp. 52-63, (2017); Arora-Jonsson, Seema, Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change, Global Environmental Change, 21, 2, pp. 744-751, (2011); Asrat, Paulos, Farmers’ perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in the Dabus watershed, North-West Ethiopia, Ecological Processes, 7, 1, (2018); Bakhsh, Khuda, Adaptation to climate change in rain-fed farming system in Punjab, Pakistan, International Journal of the Commons, 13, 2, pp. 833-847, (2019); Bankoff, Greg, A history of poverty: The politics of natural disasters in the Philippines, 1985–95, Pacific Review, 12, 3, pp. 381-420, (1999); Framework for Integrated Water Management in the Thua Thien Hue Province Delft University of Technology, (2014); Agriculture and Development Discussion Paper Series 2017 3, (2023); Bryan, Elizabeth, Adaptation to climate change in Ethiopia and South Africa: options and constraints, Environmental Science and Policy, 12, 4, pp. 413-426, (2009); Coumou, Dim, A decade of weather extremes, Nature Climate Change, 2, 7, pp. 491-496, (2012)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","25097954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100032246"

The textural properties of cashew nut shell char changed significantly following different pathways between CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O gasification. Micropores and mesopores were well developed along with the conversion in the case of H<inf>2</inf>O gasification instead of only micropores in the case of CO<inf>2</inf> gasification. Regarding char gasification kinetics, an increase of the temperature from 800 to 1000°C enhanced five times the conversion rate under an H<inf>2</inf>O atmosphere and 15 times under a CO<inf>2</inf> atmosphere. The conversion rate increased two times when the concentration of reacting gases changed from 20 to 60 vol % for both atmospheres.

Despite this fact, very limited research has been performed to investigate the effects of green integration and environmental knowledge (EK) on green performance of construction projects. Therefore, the current study was conducted to fill this gap in the literature. A framework of many hypotheses regarding interactions between green integration (i.e., supplier, internal, and customer integration), environmental knowledge, and green performance was developed and validated by data collected from 19 construction projects in Vietnam, with the support of Structural Equation Modeling. The findings show that environmental knowledge is a significant antecedent to the development of green integration strategies. Moreover, customer integration and supplier integration have direct effects on green performance, whereas internal integration has an indirect effect on green performance through supplier integration. It is surprising to see that internal integration does not have direct effects on both customer integration and green performance. Theoretically, this study is one of the first efforts in construction that develops a framework of green supply chain integration in which the roles of integration and environmental knowledge to achieve green project objectives are highlighted. Practically, our study suggests that construction firms need to accumulate environmental knowledge and develop integration within their firms before implementing green integration strategies at the supply chain level. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction; Environmental Knowledge; Green Performance; Supply Chain Integration; Construction Industry; Green Manufacturing; Industrial Research; Sales; Supply Chains; Construction Projects; Customer Integrations; Environmental Knowledge; Integration Strategy; Manufacturing Industries; Structural Equation Modeling; Supplier Integration; Supply-chain Integration; Integration","Construction industry; Green manufacturing; Industrial research; Sales; Supply chains; Construction projects; Customer integrations; Environmental knowledge; Integration strategy; Manufacturing industries; Structural equation modeling; Supplier integration; Supply-chain integration; Integration","","","","Adetunji, Israel, Achieving sustainability in the construction supply chain, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Engineering Sustainability, 161, 3, pp. 161-172, (2008); Benchmarking an International Journal, (2019); Ali, Yousaf, Integration of green supply chain management practices in construction supply chain of CPEC, Management of Environmental Quality, 31, 1, pp. 185-200, (2020); Ambrosini, Véronique, What are dynamic capabilities and are they a useful construct in strategic management?, International Journal of Management Reviews, 11, 1, pp. 29-49, (2009); Aragón-Correa, Juan Alberto Alberto, Proactive Corporate Environmental Strategies: Myths and Misunderstandings, Long Range Planning, 40, 3, pp. 357-381, (2007); Construction Management and Economics, (2020); Journal of Consumer Research, (1991); Balasubramanian, Sreejith, Green supply chain management: the case of the construction sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Production Planning and Control, 28, 14, pp. 1116-1138, (2017); Balasubramanian, Sreejith, Green supply chain management: an empirical investigation on the construction sector, Supply Chain Management, 22, 1, pp. 58-81, (2017); Balasubramanian, Sreejith, Environmental supply chain management in the construction sector: theoretical underpinnings, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 21, 5, pp. 502-528, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","23525509","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099459961"

The authors demonstrate that micro-cracks also act as the additional recombination centers, which reduce short-circuit current density (J<inf>sc</inf>), open-circuit voltage (V<inf>oc</inf>), and the effective lifetime of carriers in solar cells, in PID condition. This hypothesis was confirmed by external quantum efficiency measurements and microwave photo-conductance decay method at the micro-cracked areas before and after PID stress tests. In addition, the PID recovery was made significantly but non-fully for the laminated micro-cracked modules owing to the electrical PID recovery method. In addition, the authors showed and discussed the challenging problems in recovering the performance of the PID-affected micro-cracked solar modules without lamination. The achieved results from 11 cycles of PID stress/recovery tests with the same duration of PID stress and recovery processes showed that an exponentially decreasing function fits the correlation between the relative losses of P<inf>max</inf>, V<inf>oc</inf>, fill factor (FF), and J<inf>sc</inf> due to the PID stress process and the number of the PID stress/recovery cycles. This provides a model for the estimation of the relative losses of P<inf>max</inf>, V<inf>oc</inf>, FF, and J<inf>sc</inf> due to the PID stress process versus the number of the PID stress/recovery cycles. Finally, based on the decreasing tendency in the performance loss of the PID-affected laminated micro-cracked solar modules after PID stress/recovery cycles, the authors suggest that cyclic PID tests with suitable conditions might be a reasonable approach to control PID. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyclic Pid Test; Exponential Model; Micro-crack; Pid Recovery; Potential Induced Degradation (pid); Laminating; Open Circuit Voltage; Recovery; Silicon Solar Cells; Crystalline Si Solar Cells; Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells; Decreasing Functions; Effective Lifetime; External Quantum Efficiency; Induced Degradation; Recombination Centers; Suitable Conditions; Solar Cell Arrays","Laminating; Open circuit voltage; Recovery; Silicon solar cells; Crystalline Si solar cells; Crystalline silicon solar cells; Decreasing functions; Effective lifetime; External quantum efficiency; Induced degradation; Recombination centers; Suitable conditions; Solar cell arrays","","","","Pingel, Sebastian, Potential induced degradation of solar cells and panels, Conference Record of the IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, pp. 2817-2822, (2010); Proc 25th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conf Exhib 5th World Conf Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, (2010); Schütze, Matthias, Laboratory study of potential induced degradation of silicon photovoltaic modules, Conference Record of the IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, pp. 000821-000826, (2011); 25th Eupvsec, (2010); Hara, Koujirou, Potential-induced degradation in photovoltaic modules based on n-type single crystalline Si solar cells, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 140, pp. 361-365, (2015); Yamaguchi, Seira, Progression of rapid potential-induced degradation of n-type single-crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules, Applied Physics Express, 9, 11, (2016); 15th Pvsec, (2005); Ziebarth, Benedikt, Potential-induced degradation in solar cells: Electronic structure and diffusion mechanism of sodium in stacking faults of silicon, Journal of Applied Physics, 116, 9, (2014); Nguyen, Dong Chung, Elucidating the mechanism of potential induced degradation delay effect by ultraviolet light irradiation for p-type crystalline silicon solar cells, Solar Energy, 199, pp. 55-62, (2020); Israil, Mohd Bony, Automatic detection of micro-crack in solar wafers and cells: A review, Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, 35, 5, pp. 606-618, (2013)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","1099159X; 10627995","","PPHOE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097015902"

The material flow analysis (MFA) technique was used throughout the study for calculating efficiency of waste treatment processes and also for conversion/accumulation of materials with purpose to improve the soil quality for cultivation purpose in the garden. The experimental results showed that the garden in the system plays an important role in receiving, conversion, uptake and accumulation of the nutrients from waste flows, and by that way, in effective removal the pollutants from waste flows as well. In this system, the wastewater from catfish ponds was treated by using water morning glory, a local aquatic plant, before to be reused for watering the cultivation plants in the garden, and the removal percentage of Total Organic Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Kallium in wastewater were 33.3, 21.7, 59,5 and 37,5%, respectively. All the solid wastes (sludge from catfish ponds, cow manure from livestock, and absorbed biochar material) were reused as organic fertilizer (compost), and served as sources of additional nutrients for cultivation of Pennisennon purpurecums-schumach grass and maize plants in the garden. Biochar material, which was produced from dried leaves in the garden, was used for treatment of biogas effluent before using later for watering the garden. Total wastewater after being treated and reused for maize plants was 9575 m3/ha, in which absorbed water by maize plant was 48.02 m3/ha, and 9527 m3/ha was evaporated and accumulated in soil. The Nitrogen absorbed by maize plant was 4.12 g/m2, and the soil organic carbon stock in the AZEIS system was 0.19 mg/ha/crop. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agro-based Zero Emission Integrated System (azeis); Catfish Farming; Material Flow Analysis (mfa); Soil Cultivation; Waste Treatment; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Composting; Effluent Treatment; Fertilizers; Integrated Control; Lakes; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Removal; Nutrients; Organic Carbon; Plants (botany); Soil Pollution; Soils; Solid Wastes; Wastewater Reclamation; Wastewater Treatment; Water Treatment; Calculating Efficiencies; Material Flow Analysis; Materials With Purpose; Organic Fertilizers; Soil Organic Carbon Stocks; Total Organic Carbon; Uptake And Accumulations; Waste Treatment Process; Effluents","Agriculture; Air pollution; Composting; Effluent treatment; Fertilizers; Integrated control; Lakes; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soil pollution; Soils; Solid wastes; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Calculating efficiencies; Material flow analysis; Materials with purpose; Organic fertilizers; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Total Organic Carbon; Uptake and accumulations; Waste treatment process; Effluents","","","The research team would like to thank to the Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) for funding the research project KHCN-TNB.ĐT/14–19/C36, the Angiang local authorities for assistance during site investigation and demonstration, and the ASEAN-European Academic University network (ASEA-UNINET) for collaboration with IPPE, TU Graz, Austria, to implement this study.

While the domestic demand of using organic fertilizers for clean agriculture is increasing, these organic materials are disposed in a wasteful way. This study indicated that the nitrogen (N) concentration of the waste that include septic tank sludge (STS), food waste (FW) and sludge from seafood waste water treatment plant (SFS) is quite high by 965 mg/L, 34,314 mg/L and 1,756 mg/L. In this study, an Anaerobic Digester_Continuously Stirred Tank Reaction (ADCSTR) system was established to recover the N from these wastes. The ADCSTR was made of 5 mm thick tempered glass, with the dimension of the tank is H x D x R = 1,000 mm x 300 mm x 300 mm. The C/N ratio used for the ADCSTR was 25, which was identified by pre-testing seven small AD systems with different C/N ratios. The result revealed that after 50 d of anaerobic digestion, the Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N) concentrations of liquid product was 9,628.3 mg/L and 648.5 mg/L, and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) was 11.35 as well, equivalent to 78.2 % of recovering efficiency.

Though there are several existing studies on evacuation modeling in the case of an earthquake, research that integrates road blockades into evacuation simulations is quite limited. From that viewpoint, this research aims to develop evacuation modeling with consideration of road blockades to simulate how residents move to evacuation centers (hereafter, shelters) through urban areas following an earthquake occurrence. The research also determines difficulties that residents may encounter under earthquake conditions, compared with normal conditions, corresponding to considering or not considering road blockades, respectively, such as having no access to shelters, taking longer routes instead of shortest routes, and so on. Debris from damaged buildings in an urban area is assumed as the main source of debris that would cause a road blockade. The model is applied to a case study of the Daitoku school district in Kanazawa city. According to simulated results, due to road blockades, occupants of many damaged buildings did not have access to shelters, and a lot of evacuees needed to move to shelters with longer routes instead of taking the shortest routes. Furthermore, the research results show the possibility of considering road blockades for improving current evacuation modeling and making evacuation simulations more realistic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accessibility; Damaged Building; Debris; Evacuee; Geographic Information System (gis); Network Analysis; Disaster Management; Earthquake Epicenter; Earthquake Event; Modeling; Simulated Annealing; Simulation; Strategic Approach; Urban Area; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Kanazawa","disaster management; earthquake epicenter; earthquake event; modeling; simulated annealing; simulation; strategic approach; urban area; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Kanazawa","","","Funding: This work was funded by JSPS KAKENHI; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) Grant Numbers 20K03138, 19K04750, 18K04523.","Learning from Megadisasterslessons from the Great East Japanese Earthquake Evacuation Center Management, (2014); East Asia Forum, (2016); Bernardini, Gabriele, An agent-based model for earthquake pedestrians' evacuation simulation in Urban scenarios, Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 255-263, (2014); Pourrahmani, Elham, Dynamic evacuation routing plan after an earthquake, Natural Hazards Review, 16, 4, (2015); Han, Yanbin, Extended route choice model based on available evacuation route set and its application in crowd evacuation simulation, Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 75, pp. 1-16, (2017); D'orazio, Marco, Agent-based model for earthquake pedestrians' evacuation in urban outdoor scenarios: Behavioural patterns definition and evacuation paths choice, Safety Science, 62, pp. 450-465, (2014); Proceedings of the International Joint Workshop on Spatial Planning for Disaster Prevention and Sustainable Development, (2016); Nguyen, Dinh Thanh, Comparative study on going to evacuation shelters in school districts and the nearest shelter in the city -A Case Study of Kanazawa City, Japan, Disaster Advances, 10, 8, pp. 21-30, (2017); Nguyen, Dinh Thanh, A GIS-Based Model for Integrating Risk Estimations of Residential Building Damage and Shelter Capacity in the Case of Earthquakes, Natural Hazards Review, 21, 2, (2020); Tamima, Umma, Development of evacuation models for moderate seismic zones: A case study of Montreal, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 16, pp. 167-179, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102601300"

To develop a suitable landfill leachate treatment system and to minimize the risk of environmental pollution, it is important to characterize seasonal and temporal variations of landfill leachates. This study investigated the leachate quality of the Nam Son waste landfill in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2017–2019 and characterized the potential risks of landfill leachate using a leachate pollution index (LPI). The results of this study showed that the seasonal and temporal variation of the overall LPI during the monitoring period was small and in the range of 20–25 (values 2.5 times higher than the maximum permissible limits of Vietnam National Technical Regulation on Industrial Wastewater). The LPI sub-indices attributed to organic and inorganic pollutants were major components of the LPI.

MGs can contribute to mitigating the operating cost and environmental emissions of power systems. Accordingly, the optimal operation of such systems is of very high significance. In this relation, the problem of optimal day-ahead scheduling of MGs is studied in this paper in the presence of renewable power generation, EVs, and storage systems. The problem is modeled as a scenario-based stochastic optimization problem, characterized using the Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) method. The developed framework includes one objective function, defined as the total operating cost minimization and the presented single-objective optimization problem is tackled using an effective optimization technique, named “modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA)”. The suggested optimization framework takes into consideration various charging/discharging patterns of EVs. Finally, the problem is simulated on a test MG and the obtained results are compared to those derived by other algorithms to verify the performance of the MSFLA algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Day-ahead Scheduling; Electric Vehicle; Microgrid; Renewable Energy; Stochastic Programming; Microgrids; Monte Carlo Methods; Operating Costs; Optimization; Scheduling; Electric Vehicles (evs); Environmental Emissions; Modified Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithms; Optimization Framework; Optimization Techniques; Renewable Power Generation; Single Objective Optimization Problems; Stochastic Optimization Problems; Hybrid Vehicles; Algorithm; Alternative Energy; Electric Vehicle; Microgrid; Mitigation; Monte Carlo Analysis; Optimization; Scheduling","Microgrids; Monte Carlo methods; Operating costs; Optimization; Scheduling; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental emissions; Modified shuffled frog leaping algorithms; Optimization framework; Optimization techniques; Renewable power generation; Single objective optimization problems; Stochastic optimization problems; Hybrid vehicles; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; microgrid; mitigation; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; scheduling","","","","Aghaei, Jamshid, Contribution of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles in power system uncertainty management, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 59, pp. 450-458, (2016); Ali, Rawshan Othman, Hydrologic alteration at the upper and middle part of the yangtze river, China: Towards sustainable water resource management under increasing water exploitation, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 19, (2019); Cao, Bin, Hybrid Microgrid Many-Objective Sizing Optimization with Fuzzy Decision, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 28, 11, pp. 2702-2710, (2020); Cao, Bin, Multiobjective Evolution of Fuzzy Rough Neural Network via Distributed Parallelism for Stock Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 28, 5, pp. 939-952, (2020); Zhao, Xuan, Construction of electric vehicle driving cycle for studying electric vehicle energy consumption and equivalent emissions, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 30, pp. 37395-37409, (2020); Bejarano, Maria Dolores, Tradeoff between economic and environmental costs and benefits of hydropower production at run-of-river-diversion schemes under different environmental flows scenarios, Journal of Hydrology, 572, pp. 790-804, (2019); Lu, Hongwei, Evaluating the global potential of aquifer thermal energy storage and determining the potential worldwide hotspots driven by socio-economic, geo-hydrologic and climatic conditions, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 112, pp. 788-796, (2019); Druitt, James, Simulation of demand management and grid balancing with electric vehicles, Journal of Power Sources, 216, pp. 104-116, (2012); Elbeltagi, E.

Although silicate minerals are the most abundant in rock-forming minerals of concrete aggregates, changes upon irradiation in these minerals are not clearly understood, particularly at high irradiation doses. In this study, tectosilicates, i.e., crystal quartz and two feldspars (albite and microcline), were irradiated with 3 MeV Si2+ to a maximum fluence of 2 × 1016 ions/cm2 (approximately two orders of magnitude higher than amorphization fluence), followed by a step height measurement and nano-indentation to quantify the change in volume and mechanical properties. The results show that the fluence dependence of RIVE is similar in quartz and feldspars, but the mechanism of the expansion differs. In quartz, amorphization is completed at a low fluence, followed by the relaxation of network and cavity formation. In feldspar minerals, amorphization occurs slowly. Subsequently, volume expansion is insignificant after the completion of amorphization. Hardness change appears to be a function of amorphization, whereas the Young's modulus is almost correlated with RIVE. The alkali ions in the silicate minerals can affect both the amorphization kinetics and the final amorphous structure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorphization; Irradiation Defects; Nanoindentation; Radiation-induced Volume Expansion; Silicate Minerals; Amorphization; Concrete Aggregates; Elastic Moduli; Expansion; Feldspar; Ion Bombardment; Ions; Quartz; Silicates; Amorphous Structures; Fluence Dependence; Irradiation Dose; Orders Of Magnitude; Radiation-induced; Rock-forming Minerals; Step Height Measurement; Volume Expansion; Concretes","Amorphization; Concrete aggregates; Elastic moduli; Expansion; Feldspar; Ion bombardment; Ions; Quartz; Silicates; Amorphous structures; Fluence dependence; Irradiation dose; Orders of magnitude; Radiation-induced; Rock-forming minerals; Step height measurement; Volume expansion; Concretes","","","A part of this study was the results from the \""Japan Concrete Aging Management Program on Irradiation Effects (JCAMP)\"" sponsored by METI in Japan.

This study carried out a structured interview and life cycle assessment to explore the influence of AWD on life-cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions, yields and agronomic management in An Giang Province, Vietnam, which is the 5th-largest rice producer in the world. Farmers in An Giang Province were trained in a course that introduced them to AWD as a technological package known as ‘one must do, five reductions’. All farmers interviewed who attended the course reported that they were implementing AWD (AWD farmers), whereas interviewed farmers who did not attend the course reported that they did not implement AWD (non-AWD farmers). The present study showed that yields were almost identical among the AWD and non-AWD farmers. Irrespective of the water management, on-site burning was practised as straw management by >75% of farmers. Due to the influence of the technological campaigns, AWD allowed farmers in An Giang Province to reduce LC-GHG emissions without decreasing yields significantly and with lower use of fertilizers (nitrogen and phosphate) and seeds. Furthermore, the results suggest that a reduction in the use of fertilizer and seed does not reduce yields significantly for either AWD or non-AWD farmers, but careful straw management is required to avoid an increase in LC-GHG emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Alternate Wetting And Drying; Greenhouse Gas; Life Cycle Assessment; Rice Yield; Agronomy; Economic And Social Effects; Emission Control; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Hydraulic Structures; Nitrogen Fertilizers; Phosphate Fertilizers; Seed; Water Management; Wetting; Emissions Reduction; Ghg Emission; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Management Is; Rice (oryza Sativa L.); Rice Production; Straw Management; Wetting And Drying; Life Cycle","Agronomy; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic structures; Nitrogen fertilizers; Phosphate fertilizers; Seed; Water management; Wetting; Emissions reduction; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management IS; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Rice production; Straw management; WETTING AND DRYING; Life cycle","","","The authors are very thankful to Mr. Huynh Van Thao, Mr. Huynh Cong Khanh, and Ms. Huynh Thi Diem at CanTho University for conducting the farm survey, Dr. Nguyen Xuan Loc at CanTho University for comments on the questionnaire, Dr. Yokoyama in JIRCAS for providing very useful background information and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in An Giang Province for selecting the farmers.","Belder, P., Crop performance, nitrogen and water use in flooded and aerobic rice, Plant and Soil, 273, 1-2, pp. 167-182, (2005); Philipp J Crop Sci, (2016); Bond, Tami C., Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 118, 11, pp. 5380-5552, (2013); Water Management in Irrigated Rice Coping with Water Scarcity, (2007); Quantitative Data Analysis with Spss for Windows A Guide for Social Scientists, (2001); Cai, Zucong, Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy fields as affected by nitrogen fertilisers and water management, Plant and Soil, 196, 1, pp. 7-14, (1997); Carrijo, Daniela R., Rice yields and water use under alternate wetting and drying irrigation: A meta-analysis, Field Crops Research, 203, pp. 173-180, (2017); Chang, Chih Hua, Emissions inventory for rice straw open burning in Taiwan based on burned area classification and mapping using Formosat-2 satellite imagery, Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 13, 2, pp. 474-487, (2013); Omonrice, (2007); Rice A Practical Guide to Nutrient Management, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097711050"

Density functional theory calculations indicate that this structure of [C(NH2)3]2PbI4 is more energetically stable than the reported structure belonging to the Pmna space group. The crystalline and electronic structures of the new [C(NH2)3]2PbI4 are calculated by various functionals with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Powder X-ray diffraction on [C(NH2)3]2PbI4 powder and thin film materials confirm the Pmna structure. A weak, but sharp, free excitonic peak combined with a strong broadened emission feature due to the corrugated 2D layers is observed by the absorption measurement of the thin film samples and by photoluminescence spectra. The present article shows that the complementarity between experiment and simulation improves the structural and optical understanding of this new 2D [C(NH2)3]2PbI4 material. Furthermore, this material is crucial to the study of both free excitonic effects and strong exciton-phonon coupling in a double-layer confinement. In addition, our results indicate that the relativistic effect of electrons with nonzero angular momentum via SOC in this compound plays a central role in its electronic properties. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","D Region; Density Functional Theory; Electronic Properties; Electronic Structure; Iodine Compounds; Layered Semiconductors; Lead Compounds; Nanocrystalline Materials; Perovskite; Photoluminescence; Spin Orbit Coupling; Thin Films; Absorption Measurements; Crystalline Structure; Exciton-phonon Couplings; Photoluminescence Spectrum; Powder X Ray Diffraction; Relativistic Effects; Thin Film Material; Two Dimensional (2 D); Crystal Structure","D region; Density functional theory; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Iodine compounds; Layered semiconductors; Lead compounds; Nanocrystalline materials; Perovskite; Photoluminescence; Spin orbit coupling; Thin films; Absorption measurements; Crystalline structure; Exciton-phonon couplings; Photoluminescence spectrum; Powder X ray diffraction; Relativistic effects; Thin film material; Two Dimensional (2 D); Crystal structure","","","","Weber, Dieter, CH3NH3SnBrxI3-x (x = 0-3), a Sn(II)-System with Cubic Perovskite Structure, Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung - Section B Journal of Chemical Sciences, 33, 8, pp. 862-865, (1978); Kojima, Akihiro, Organometal halide perovskites as visible-light sensitizers for photovoltaic cells, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 131, 17, pp. 6050-6051, (2009); Yin, Wei, Recent advances in interface engineering for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells, Molecules, 21, 7, (2016); Chung, In, All-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells with high efficiency, Nature, 485, 7399, pp. 486-489, (2012); Chen, Min, Cesium Titanium(IV) Bromide Thin Films Based Stable Lead-free Perovskite Solar Cells, Joule, 2, 3, pp. 558-570, (2018); Habibi, Mehran, Progress in emerging solution-processed thin film solar cells - Part II: Perovskite solar cells, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 62, pp. 1012-1031, (2016); Malinkiewicz, Olga, Perovskite solar cells employing organic charge-transport layers, Nature Photonics, 8, 2, pp. 128-132, (2014); Zuo, Chuantian, Advances in perovskite solar cells, Advanced Science, 3, 7, (2016); Ball, James M., Low-temperature processed meso-superstructured to thin-film perovskite solar cells, Energy and Environmental Science, 6, 6, pp. 1739-1743, (2013); Hao, Feng, Lead-free solid-state organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells, Nature Photonics, 8, 6, pp. 489-494, (2014)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","19327455; 19327447","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099661655"

This research examined the current adoption of biogas digestion of livestock waste treatment at household farms in order to provide insights for policy towards effective implementation. A questionnaire survey was conducted in September 2019, with the participation of 120 livestock owners in Nghe An province, which focussed on accessing their perspectives on biogas and examination of factors impacting their decisions to utilize this technology. Most respondents determined biogas to be an attractive solution for improving the environment. However, several factors limited the development of biogas installation, including technical and financial barriers, awareness and capacity limitations, and financial support as the most significant of these. Government support and policies that encourage household biogas utilization as a sustainable energy source to combat climate change is recommended. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Security; Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction; Nghe An Province; Pig Production; Waste Management; Water Safety","","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) for providing generous funding to support this research.

Ninety-six point seven percent of the 120 households received financial support but four households (3.3%) had to pay for the construction cost themselves (about 10-15 million VND). Considering the monthly income of most respondents (from 2-6 million VND), installation is an extravagance. Household decisions to adopt biogas digester installation with no or minimal support stemmed from either complaints regarding livestock waste, and recommendations or experience from other households with biogas digesters as to their benefits.","Cambodia Energy Sector Assessment Strategy and Road Map, (2025); Mission Report on Design Selection of Domestic Biogas Plant for the Uganda Domestic Programme, (2009); Cu, Thi T., Manure management practices on biogas and non-biogas pig farms in developing countries - Using livestock farms in Vietnam as an example, Journal of Cleaner Production, 27, pp. 64-71, (2012); Dan Phn Di Tri Heo Gay O Nhim Lanh do Huyn Hp Khn, (2020); Economics and Policy of Energy and the Environment, (2021); International Workshop Vietnam Livestock Sector in Economic Integration Experience Sharing Future Orientation, (2016); Livestock Sector, (2020); Tri Ln Gay O Nhim B Bao Vay, (2011); Roubík, Hynek, Current approach to manure management for small-scale Southeast Asian farmers - Using Vietnamese biogas and non-biogas farms as an example, Renewable Energy, 115, pp. 362-370, (2018); Jackson, H.

Solving these issues allows further penetration of IBRs in power grid. Recently, a new operational mode named as grid-forming (GFM) is introduced as a promising method to solve these problems since IBRs at this mode will behave as voltage sources, contributing virtual inertia or fast frequency control. This paper shows the methodology to realize droop-type GFM mode in type IV wind turbine then allows it to provide inertia control.

Development of renewable energy from livestock wastes, e.g., production of electricity from biogas, is a solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from untreated livestock wastes, as well as energy shortages. So that, biogas technology has been researched and applied in Vietnam since the 1960s. The development and state-of-art issue of household biogas, specifically, the opportunities and constraints of household biogas are presented in this paper. There are several opportunities for household biogas development, including, the availability of biogas fermentation materials, energy shortage issues, and policy support from the Government of Vietnam and international organizations. Besides, barriers encountered in household biogas development in Vietnam included technical barriers, financial policy barriers, awareness and capacity limitations. The capacity building should include the dissemination and update of policy to maintain transparency and credibility for attracting potential domestic investors. Training courses should be provided to technical staff of biogas digester on operation and maintenance. Measures should be taken to improve the policy and mechanisms, especially, financial mechanisms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogas; Climate Change; Green House Gases; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: The Vietnam Biogas Programme was founded in 2003 by SNV with funding from the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS), aiming to effectively exploit biogas technologies and develop a commercially viable biogas sector in Vietnam.

The designed system is energized by renewable resources to produce pure oxygen in situ through water electrolysis for oxygenation according to the changes of dissolved oxygen of species under culture. Moreover, the by-product hydrogen from the electrolysis process is used to generate backup power for an eventual power failure. The mathematical models of the system were developed for simulation and optimization to assess the performance of the system regarding technical, economic, and environmental aspects as multi-objective functions in autonomous mode as well as on-grid mode. The merits of the proposed system are demonstrated at a shrimp farm. Furthermore, the optimal results and their sensitivity analysis showed that the sustainable hybrid energy system operating in grid-connected mode, which possesses such attractive features as producing onsite pure oxygen for oxygenation and utilizing the by-product hydrogen for generating backup power, could bring significant benefits for farmers thanks to a notable reduction in the annualized cost of the system as well as CO<inf>2</inf> emission in comparison with the conventional system, which is powered by the national grid to run common paddlewheel aerators for oxygenation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aeration; By-product Hydrogen; Electrolyzer; Fuel Cell; Onsite Pure Oxygen; Renewable Energy; Aquaculture; Dissolved Oxygen; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Electrolysis; Functions; Hydrogen Production; Oxygenation; Sensitivity Analysis; Uninterruptible Power Systems; Aquaculture Industry; Conventional Systems; Environmental Aspects; Grid-connected Modes; Hybrid Energy System; Multi-objective Functions; Paddlewheel Aerators; Simulation And Optimization; Multiobjective Optimization; Aquaculture Industry; Byproduct; Design; Hydrogen; Optimization; Oxygenation; Renewable Resource; Smart Grid; Sustainability; Decapoda (crustacea)","Aquaculture; Dissolved oxygen; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolysis; Functions; Hydrogen production; Oxygenation; Sensitivity analysis; Uninterruptible power systems; Aquaculture industry; Conventional systems; Environmental aspects; Grid-connected modes; Hybrid energy system; Multi-objective functions; Paddlewheel aerators; Simulation and optimization; Multiobjective optimization; aquaculture industry; byproduct; design; hydrogen; optimization; oxygenation; renewable resource; smart grid; sustainability; Decapoda (Crustacea)","","","This work was supported in part by the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14–P6 through the Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) Loan.","Globefish Highlights October 2019 Issue with Jan Jun 2019 Statistics A Quarterly Update on World Seafood Markets, (2020); Marine Shrimp Culture Principles and Practices, (1992); Boyd, Claude Elson, Pond water aeration systems, Aquacultural Engineering, 18, 1, pp. 9-40, (1998); Moore, John Michael, Design of small paddle wheel aerators, Aquacultural Engineering, 11, 1, pp. 55-69, (1992); Boyd, Claude Elson, Dissolved Oxygen and Aeration in Ictalurid Catfish Aquaculture, Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 49, 1, pp. 7-70, (2018); Operating Procedures for Shrimp Farming Global Shrimp Op Survey Results and Recommendations, (2006); Zhu, Dantong, Effect of intermittent aeration mode on nitrogen concentration in the water column and sediment pore water of aquaculture ponds, Journal of Environmental Sciences (China), 90, pp. 331-342, (2020); Hoagland, Richard H., Evaluation of automated aeration control in shrimp ponds, Journal of Applied Aquaculture, 11, 3, pp. 45-55, (2001); Cruz, Francis Cedric, A feasibility study on the benefits of feedback aerator control in precision aquaculture applications for the developing world, 2B-2019, (2019); Deng, Hongjie, An intelligent aerator algorithm inspired-by deep learning, Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 16, 4, pp. 2990-3002, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18790682; 09601481","9780123750259","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094951539"

It was found that awareness was positively correlated with higher education levels, and that all groups were encouraged by the perceived environmental friendliness of biofuel. In terms of willingness to purchase, there was a clear difference in the perception of the appropriate pricing policy for biofuels between the public groups and the experts, with the former preferring higher prices and the latter lower prices.

Here, we explore the relationship between the elastic properties, thermal conductivity, and structure of In4Se3. The experimentally determined average sound velocity (2010 m·s-1), Young's modulus (47 GPa), and Debye temperature (198 K) of In4Se3 are rather low, indicating considerable lattice softening. This behavior, which is consistent with low thermal conductivity, can be related to the complex bonding found in this material, in which strong covalent In-In and In-Se bonds coexist with weaker electrostatic interactions. Phonon dispersion calculations show that Einstein-like modes occur at ≈30 cm-1. These Einstein-like modes can be ascribed to weakly bonded In+ cations located between strongly bonded [(In3)5+(Se2-)3]- layers. The Grüneisen parameter for the soft-bonded In+ at the frequencies of the Einstein-like modes is large, indicating a high degree of bond anharmonicity and hence increased phonon scattering. The calculated thermal conductivity and elastic properties are in good agreement with experimental results. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Grüneisen Parameter; Lattice Softening; Lone Pair; Thermal Conductivity; Thermoelectric Materials; Binary Alloys; Elastic Moduli; Elasticity; Phonons; Waste Heat; Waste Heat Utilization; Anharmonicities; Elastic Properties; Low Thermal Conductivity; Phonon Dispersions; Thermo-electric Materials; Thermal Conductivity","Binary alloys; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Phonons; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Anharmonicities; Elastic properties; Low thermal conductivity; Phonon dispersions; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermal conductivity","","","S.D.N.L. and K.T.W. thank the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Technology for hosting and financial support within the TEAM −TECH/2016-2/14 project of the Foundation for Polish Science, entitled “New approach for the development of efficient materials for direct conversion of heat into electricity project”, co-financed by the European Union under the European Regional Development Fund.

This study explores a new separation method via applying microwave irradiation. Butanol/water droplet was monitored during exposure to microwave irradiation at different power rates. The surface tension, droplet volume, and temperature were scrutinized during and after exposure to microwave irradiation. The data obtained indicated that the microwave-induced evaporation rates of alcohols were much higher than that of water. Consequently, the vaporized phase contained a much higher alcohol content than the liquid phase. In particular, butanol concentration in the aqueous phase could be reduced to ~ 0.1 wt. %, which was more effective than the theoretical limit via the boiling process. The method is an attractive option to complement the fermentation process, which produces a low butanol concentration solution.

In this respect, the power generation of such a technology is highly impacted by several factors, such as temperature and solar irradiance. As an effective solution, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) approaches have been developed and used in PV systems to increase the efficiency subject to the changing climate conditions. In this respect, a combinatorial MPPT technique is presented in this paper based on the fuzzy controller and BAT optimization algorithm to desirably tune the control parameters. To this end, the membership functions of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are appropriately specified to cope with uncertainties caused by changing climatic conditions. The studied PV system, equipped with the MPPT technique, operates jointly with an electrical energy storage system which is based on a lead-acid battery. By employing this hybrid generation system, the solar power generation intermittency can be well compensated and the stabilized power output can be achieved. The proposed model is then simulated on a typical hybrid energy system, including a PV system and a battery energy storage (BES) system. In this respect, the superior performance of the suggested control scheme is verified through making a comprehensive comparison with other well-known techniques. Besides, the behavior of the system under varying climate conditions is studied and the desired performance of the suggested combinatorial controller is validated. For example, the presented BAT-FLC scheme can help the hybrid system reach 99% efficiency for partial shading conditions (PSCs) which is 18% more compared to the prevalent perturb and observe (P&O) technique. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bat Optimization Algorithm; Battery; Fuzzy Logic System; Hybrid Energy System; Mppt; Photovoltaic; Controllers; Energy Storage; Fuzzy Logic; Hybrid Systems; Lead Acid Batteries; Maximum Power Point Trackers; Membership Functions; Solar Energy; Solar Power Plants; Temperature Control; Tracking (position); Battery Energy Storages (bes); Comprehensive Comparisons; Electrical Energy Storage Systems; Hybrid Generation System; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques; Optimization Algorithms; Photovoltaic Generation; Solar Power Generation","Controllers; Energy storage; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid systems; Lead acid batteries; Maximum power point trackers; Membership functions; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Temperature control; Tracking (position); Battery energy storages (BES); Comprehensive comparisons; Electrical energy storage systems; Hybrid generation system; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Maximum power point tracking techniques; Optimization algorithms; Photovoltaic generation; Solar power generation","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Lac Hong University.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Lac Hong University.","Ahmadi, Abdollah, Information-Gap Decision Theory for Robust Security-Constrained Unit Commitment of Joint Renewable Energy and Gridable Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 16, 5, pp. 3064-3075, (2020); Ahmed, Jubaer, A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV system using Cuckoo Search with partial shading capability, Applied Energy, 119, pp. 118-130, (2014); Ahmed, Emad M., Multifunctional distributed MPPT controller for 3P4W grid-connected PV systems in distribution network with unbalanced loads, Energies, 12, 24, (2019); Barzkar, Arash, A novel peak load shaving algorithm via real-time battery scheduling for residential distributed energy storage systems, International Journal of Energy Research, 42, 7, pp. 2400-2416, (2018); Chen, Weiming, An efficient day-ahead cost-based generation scheduling of a multi-supply microgrid using a modified krill herd algorithm, Journal of Cleaner Production, 272, (2020); Dadfar, Sajjad, Enhanced control strategies for a hybrid battery/photovoltaic system using FGS-PID in grid-connected mode, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 44, 29, pp. 14642-14660, (2019); Dârâban, Stefan R., A novel MPPT (maximum power point tracking) algorithm based on a modified genetic algorithm specialized on tracking the global maximum power point in photovoltaic systems affected by partial shading, Energy, 74, C, pp. 374-388, (2014); Farajdadian, Shahriar, Optimization of fuzzy-based MPPT controller via metaheuristic techniques for stand-alone PV systems, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 44, 47, pp. 25457-25472, (2019); Hosseini, S.

Since the output quality of PV depends mainly on the solar irradiation and cell temperature, modeling the I-V relationship regarding solar irradiation and cell temperature need to be addressed. In this paper, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is adopted to forecast the solar irradiation and temperature of a PV module. After that, a PV module model called one-diode model is introduced to identify the I-V characteristic of the PV module, which only employs the data forecasted by the LSTM-based model and the manufactured data. Since this method combines the strengths of two techniques, it solves the uncertainty of meteorological data as well as provides an effective method to model the I-V output quality of the PV module. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; I-v Characteristic; Long Short-term Memory (lstm); One-diode Model (odm); Photovoltaic Module; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Irradiation; Long Short-term Memory; Meteorology; Numerical Methods; Photovoltaic Cells; Smart Power Grids; Solar Cells; Solar Radiation; Cell Temperature; Diode Modeling; Iv Characteristics; Meteorological Data; Output Quality; Photovoltaic Systems; Real Operating Conditions; Solar Irradiation; Deep Learning","Electric power transmission networks; Irradiation; Long short-term memory; Meteorology; Numerical methods; Photovoltaic cells; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Solar radiation; Cell temperature; Diode modeling; IV characteristics; Meteorological data; Output quality; Photovoltaic systems; Real operating conditions; Solar irradiation; Deep learning","","","","Lo Brano, Valerio, An improved five-parameter model for photovoltaic modules, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 94, 8, pp. 1358-1370, (2010); Laudani, Antonino, Identification of the one-diode model for photovoltaic modules from datasheet values, Solar Energy, 108, pp. 432-446, (2014); Chen, Yujie, An improved explicit double-diode model of solar cells: Fitness verification and parameter extraction, Energy Conversion and Management, 169, pp. 345-358, (2018); Almonacid Cruz, Florencia M., Characterisation of Si-crystalline PV modules by artificial neural networks, Renewable Energy, 34, 4, pp. 941-949, (2009); Yang, Xiuyuan, Day-ahead forecasting of photovoltaic output power with similar cloud space fusion based on incomplete historical data mining, Applied Energy, 206, pp. 683-696, (2017); Theocharides, Spyros, Day-ahead photovoltaic power production forecasting methodology based on machine learning and statistical post-processing, Applied Energy, 268, (2020); Yagli, Gokhan Mert, Automatic hourly solar forecasting using machine learning models, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 105, pp. 487-498, (2019); Moghaddam Nia, Alireza, Comparison of LLR, MLP, Elman, NNARX and ANFIS Models-with a case study in solar radiation estimation, Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 71, 8-9, pp. 975-982, (2009); Alzahrani, Ahmad S., Solar Irradiance Forecasting Using Deep Neural Networks, Procedia Computer Science, 114, pp. 304-313, (2017); Wang, Dingcheng, Air temperature prediction based on EMD and LS-SVM, pp. 177-180, (2010)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Murdoch University","2020 International Conference on Smart Grids and Energy Systems, SGES 2020","","Virtual, Perth; WA","167695","","9781728185507","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102779252"

In EVs using QZSI, the good performance of the traction system requires high quality of dc-link voltage control for the inverter. To this end, it is essential to build-up a design model that captures the dynamics of both battery and Z-source inverter. Unlike almost other previous works which independently modeled the QZSI, this paper suggests a unified model of battery and QZSI. Notice that the battery-QZSI system is always influenced by the change of battery voltage and the load current depending on the operation of the vehicle and environments. In this paper, Internal Model Control (IMC) is employed as a systematic way to improve the robustness of dc-link-voltage control. Moreover, a simulation model that is very closed to the physical system is built in Matlab-Simulink. Using this simulation model, the effectiveness of the proposed model and control scheme is evaluated and compared with the classical Lead-Lag compensator based on the root-mean-square criteria. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electric Vehicles (evs); Internal Model Control (imc); Quasi Z Source Inverter (qzsi); Electric Inverters; Matlab; Model Predictive Control; Propulsion; Traction Control; Vehicles; Voltage Control; Battery Voltages; Dc Link Voltage Control; Electric Vehicles (evs); Internal Model Control; Lead-lag Compensators; Modeling And Control; Simulation Model; Z-source Inverter; Secondary Batteries","Electric inverters; MATLAB; Model predictive control; Propulsion; Traction control; Vehicles; Voltage control; Battery voltages; DC link voltage control; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Internal model control; Lead-lag compensators; Modeling and control; Simulation model; Z-source inverter; Secondary batteries","","","This study is supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) in the Program of Domestic master and doctoral training scholarships.

The SAD was performed using continuously stirred tank reactors. Meanwhile, the TAD experiment was set up using a combined system involving a continuously stirred tank for hydrolysis/acidogenesis and an upflow reactor for methanogenesis. The hydrolytic reactor operated as a batch process with a retention time (RT) of 9 days, while the methane reactor was a continuous process operation with RT of 20 days. Both TAD and SAD were controlled at a temperature of 36 °C. The SAD experiments lasted for 143 days, and were characterised by the kinetic rate constant k = 0.02 day−1 which was much lower than that for the TAD (k = 0.66 − 2.16 day−1). The SAD seemed to be inhibited by high concentration of free ammonia and low inoculum to substrate ratio; herein, only 17.8–22.3% of the initial carbon could be converted into biogas (equivalent to 91–110 Nml/g-VS<inf>added</inf>) with low methane content (44.1–48.7%). Meanwhile, TAD converted 41.67% initial carbon to biogas (equivalent to 299.0–374.6 Nml/g-VS<inf>added</inf>) with high methane content (71.68–81.0%). Moreover, methanogenesis in the TAD was highly stable which enabled the digestion process to return to normal state within a few days, even though the concentrations of the influent increased to double (6.5–24.5 g-COD/l). As per these results, the TAD was much more stable, faster, and stronger than the SAD.

One of the prevalent renewable energy technologies is the solar photovoltaic (PV) system. These solar units face some challenges, mainly due to the volatile power generation and frequent oscillations, besides low rate when tracking the maximum power. Accordingly, a novel approach is suggested in this research work to address such drawbacks in the conventional control systems. The presented framework is based on a sliding mode controller (SMC) for the sake of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) applied to solar PV units, taking into account diverse meteorological conditions. In this respect, an efficient optimization algorithm, named “θ-modified krill herd (θ-MKH) method” has been proposed to optimally determine the parameters of the SMC. The operating conditions are online and in the grid-connected state. An overarching comparison has been made between the presented approach and other methods like hill climbing (HC), β technique, fractional Voc, incremental conductance (INC), fuzzy logic controller (FLC), and classic fixed-step perturb and observe (P&O) while taking into consideration diverse meteorological conditions. The developed control framework based on the SMC and θ-MKH guarantees the desirable operation of the PV system in terms of limited oscillations and stable operation with the efficiency of 99.5% in tacking the maximum power point in rational time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mppt; Partial Shading Condition; Photovoltaic; Renewable Energy; Sliding Mode Controller; Variable Step Size; Controllers; Environmental Impact; Fuzzy Logic; Optimization; Sliding Mode Control; Solar Power Generation; Conventional Control Systems; Incremental Conductances (inc); Maximum Power Point Tracking; Meteorological Condition; Optimization Algorithms; Renewable Energy Technologies; Sliding Mode Controller; Solar Photovoltaic System; Maximum Power Point Trackers","Controllers; Environmental impact; Fuzzy logic; Optimization; Sliding mode control; Solar power generation; Conventional control systems; Incremental conductances (INC); Maximum Power Point Tracking; Meteorological condition; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energy technologies; Sliding mode controller; Solar photovoltaic system; Maximum power point trackers","","","This work was supported by Lac Hong University .","Ahmed, Emad M., Multifunctional distributed MPPT controller for 3P4W grid-connected PV systems in distribution network with unbalanced loads, Energies, 12, 24, (2019); Al-Diab, Ahmad, Variable step size P&O MPPT algorithm for PV systems, Proceedings of the International Conference on Optimisation of Electrical and Electronic Equipment, OPTIM, pp. 1097-1102, (2010); Al-Gizi, Ammar Ghalib, The use of ANN to supervise the PV MPPT based on FLC, pp. 703-708, (2017); Arteaga Orozco, M.

It shows that the IWM-EV is fundamentally a multi-agent system with physical interaction. Three ways to model the IWM-EV are proposed, and each is applicable to certain control objectives. Firstly, a nonlinear model with hierarchical structure is established, and it can be used for passivity-based motion control. Secondly, a linearized model with rank-1 interconnection matrix is presented for stability analysis. Thirdly, a time-varying state-space model is proposed for optimal control using linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The proposed modellings contribute the new understanding of IWM-EV dynamics from the view point of multi-agent-system theory. By choosing the suitable control theory for each model, the complexity level of system design is maintained constant, no matter what the number of IWMs installed to the vehicle body. The effectiveness of three models and their design approaches are discussed by several examples with Matlab/Carsim co-simulator. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-slip; Electric Vehicle; In-wheel-motor; Motion Control; Multi-agent-system; Slip-ratio; Electric Machine Control; Electric Vehicles; Learning To Rank; Motion Control; State Space Methods; Traction Motors; Vehicle Wheels; Electric Vehicles (evs); Hierarchical Structures; Interconnection Matrices; Linear Quadratic Regulator; Longitudinal Motion Control; Physical Interactions; Stability Analysis; Time-varying State Space Modeling; Multi Agent Systems","Electric machine control; Electric vehicles; Learning to rank; Motion control; State space methods; Traction motors; Vehicle wheels; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Hierarchical structures; Interconnection matrices; Linear quadratic regulator; Longitudinal motion control; Physical interactions; Stability analysis; Time-varying state space modeling; Multi agent systems","","","","Hori, Yoichi, Future vehicle driven by electricity and control - Research on four-wheel-motored ""UOT Electric March II, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 51, 5, pp. 954-962, (2004); Geng, Cong, Direct yaw-moment control of an in-wheel-motored electric vehicle based on body slip angle fuzzy observer, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 56, 5, pp. 1411-1419, (2009); Nguyen, Binhminh, Lateral stability control of electric vehicle based on disturbance accommodating kalman filter using the integration of single antenna GPS receiver and yaw rate sensor, Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology, 8, 4, pp. 899-910, (2013); Tota, Antonio, On the Experimental Analysis of Integral Sliding Modes for Yaw Rate and Sideslip Control of an Electric Vehicle with Multiple Motors, International Journal of Automotive Technology, 19, 5, pp. 811-823, (2018); Nam, Kanghyun, Lateral stability control of in-wheel-motor-driven electric vehicles based on sideslip angle estimation using lateral tire force sensors, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 61, 5, pp. 1972-1985, (2012); Kawashima, Kiyotaka, Rolling stability control based on electronic stability program for in-wheel-motor electric vehicle, World Electric Vehicle Journal, 3, 1, pp. 34-41, (2009); Fujimoto, Hiroshi, Pitching control method based on quick torque response for electric vehicle, pp. 801-806, (2010); Kanchwala, Husain, Pitch reduction and traction enhancement of an EV by real-time brake biasing and in-wheel motor torque control, International Journal of Vehicle Systems Modelling and Testing, 11, 2, pp. 165-192, (2016); Yu, Yize, Model-based pitch control for distributed drive electric vehicle, SAE Technical Papers, 2019-April, April, (2019); He, Hongwen, An acceleration slip regulation strategy for four-wheel drive electric vehicles based on sliding mode control, Energies, 7, 6, pp. 3748-3763, (2014)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093919255"

Pakistan is experiencing severe energy crises, and global warming effects have considerably changed its climate, especially the temperature, which has risen significantly. Renewable energy is uninterrupted, clean, and strengthens energy security. This study employed a linear programming model to assess the potential of renewable hydrogen power and its impact on electricity prices, measured the possible demand of wind-generated renewable hydrogen for light-duty vehicles. The findings demonstrate that Pakistan has sufficient wind-generated renewable power potential, and its light-duty vehicles could shift to renewable energy. The findings of this research recommend a policy shift to light-duty hydrogen-based vehicles to eliminate fossil fuel imports and ensure green supplies. With a shift to hydrogen-based vehicles, the government could ensure maximum revenue and green supplies.

To better understand the expansion behavior, crystal SiO<inf>2</inf> was irradiated by 2 MeV He and 3 MeV Si ions at 44 °C, 92 °C and 142 °C, following step height measurement to quantify the volume change. The amorphization was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. We found that even after the amorphization has fully occurred, the volume expansion continued at higher dose, and irradiation temperature enhanced the expansion rate. To describe the volume change in amorphized SiO<inf>2</inf>, we have developed an empirical model based on the Poisson law, considering the contribution of collision and ionization process, and estimated that the critical dose for swelling in alpha-SiO<inf>2</inf> was about 0.11 dpa (displacements per atom). The viscous flow effect, whose activation energy has been estimated as 0.13 eV in our study, could play an important role in swelling especially after the amorphization, which can explain the slower swelling process induced by neutron irradiation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorphization; Concrete Degradation; Irradiation Defects; Stress Relaxation; Activation Energy; Aggregates; Amorphization; Concrete Aggregates; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Silica; Silicon; Swelling; Displacements Per Atoms; Expansion Behavior; Ionization Process; Irradiation Temperature; Step Height Measurement; Structural Concretes; Swelling Mechanism; Volume Expansion; Neutron Irradiation","Activation energy; Aggregates; Amorphization; Concrete aggregates; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Silica; Silicon; Swelling; Displacements per atoms; Expansion behavior; Ionization process; Irradiation temperature; Step height measurement; Structural concretes; Swelling mechanism; Volume expansion; Neutron irradiation","","","A part of this study was the results from the \u201CJapan Concrete Aging Management Program on Irradiation Effects (JCAMP)\u201D sponsored by METI in Japan.

This study focuses on the connection of three main process components (husbandry-crop-fishpond) in a typical farming household located within an acid soil region of rural Vietnam. The concept of exergy analysis is used to underline the potential for resource efficiency in alternative processes in the agricultural system. For development of an integrated ecological system aiming towards zero emissions, the analytical methods of material cycles and energy flows utilized a set of indicators of resource efficiency in a sustainable agriculture. Results: The design of the ideal integrated farming system ""Agro-Industrial Zero Emissions Systems""(AIZES) can increase the system efficiency by making use of indigenous natural materials and waste reuse/recycling. Recycling waste produce energy, fish feed and fertilizer can result in a decreased environmental load of approximately half. Using exergy analysis to calculate an indicator non-renewable yield ratio (NRYR), the systems verified sustainability of agriculture production. Conclusions: The farming household will be able to subsidize their fuel and electricity consumption by utilizing biogas.

This paper selects the panel data of 12 resource-based industries in China from 2003 to 2019 and tests the impact of environmental regulation on technological innovation of resource-based industries by constructing the econometric model. The results show that environmental regulation can promote the technological innovation of resource-based industries. Specifically, environmental regulation has no significant positive impact on the immediate product innovation of 12 resource-based industries in China, but it has a significant positive impact on the product innovation lagging behind one period and two periods. Environmental regulation has no significant impact on the process innovation of current period, but has a significant positive impact on the process innovation of lagging one period. Industrial scale has a significant positive impact on product innovation of resource-based industries. The input of scientific and technological activity personnel has a significant positive impact on the product innovation of current period, and in the long run, it promotes both product innovation and process innovation. On this basis, this paper puts forward the relevant measures and suggestions for the formulation of environmental regulation policies. The government departments should subdivide the resource-based industries, formulate environmental rules and policies by classification, encourage industrial enterprises to carry out technological innovation, reasonably implement fiscal and taxation policy tools and increase the investment in R&D funds, and improve the training mechanism of scientific and technological personnel. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Regulation; Resource-based Industry; Technological Innovation; Innovation; Panel Data; Policy Approach; Policy Implementation; Training; China","innovation; panel data; policy approach; policy implementation; training; China","","","At the same time, relying on technological innovation and cooperation to deal with climate change has become an international consensus. Due to the complexity of climate change, many governments have adopted mitigation and application mechanisms; however, the research in this area is scattered and uncoordinated. Some survey found that government subsidies were not the biggest driving force in most industries, while voluntary agreements were the biggest driving force for the introduction of environmental innovation in the manufacturing industry. The United Nations and other countries in the world fight against the effects of climate change through mitigation technology measures. Due to the externality of climate governance, the development of new technologies needs a lot of financial support from the government. Most of the EUs R&D funding for low-carbon energy technologies comes from public funding from the EU Member States. Qin et al. found that a country’s propensity for climate technology innovation was affected by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions [20]. For the research on the relationship among government policies, environmental protection technology, and greenhouse gas emissions, the existing literature is conducted from the perspective of government supporting technological innovation to influence climate change [21–25]. However, will climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions affect the innovation of ecological technology? The existing research in this area is still very rare.","Journal of Economic Perspectives, (1995); Earth Scan in Business and the Environment, (1996); American Economic Review, (1987); Res Financ Econ Issues, (2015); Ecol Econ, (2007); Dam, Lammertjan, The curse of the haven: The impact of multinational enterprise on environmental regulation, Ecological Economics, 78, pp. 148-156, (2012); Acemoglu, Daron, The environment and directed technical change, American Economic Review, 102, 1, pp. 131-166, (2012); Science Research Management, (2011); Horbach, Jens, Determinants of eco-innovations by type of environmental impact - The role of regulatory push/pull, technology push and market pull, Ecological Economics, 78, pp. 112-122, (2012); Yang, Biingshiunn, The impact of uncertain environmental regulatory policy on optimal plant location and anti-pollution technology selection, Annals of Regional Science, 50, 3, pp. 753-769, (2013)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097586313"

White hard clam (Meretrix lyrata) shells (WHC) and Paspalum atratum were utilized as substrate and plant, respectively. The focus was placed on treatment performance, removal mechanisms and lifespan of the HSSF-CWs. Results indicated that WHC-based HSSF-CW with P. atratum exhibited a high P removal (89.9%). The mean P efluent concentration and P removal rate were 1.34 ± 0.95 mg/L and 0.32 ± 0.03 g/m2/d, respectively. The mass balance study showed that media sorption was the dominant P removal pathway (77.5%), followed by microbial assimilation (14.5%), plant uptake (5.4%), and other processes (2.6%). It was estimated the WHC-based bed could work effectively for approximately 2.84 years. This WHC-based HSSF-CWs technology will therefore pave the way for recycling Ca-rich waste materials as media in HSSF-CWs to enhance P-rich wastewater purification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobically Digested Swine Wastewater; Ca-rich Materials; Lifespan; Phosphorus Removal Efficiency; Removal Pathways; Calcium; Phosphorus; Phosphorus; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Molluscs; Phosphorus; Wastewater Reclamation; Mass Balance; Phosphorus Removal; Plant Uptake; Removal Mechanism; Subsurface Flow; Swine Wastewater; Treatment Performance; Wastewater Purification; Wetlands; Calcium; Phosphorus; Concentration (composition); Constructed Wetland; Performance Assessment; Pollutant Removal; Purification; Subsurface Flow; Wastewater Treatment; Article; Clam; Effluent; Meretrix Lyrata; Nonhuman; Paspalum; Paspalum Atratum; Pig; Priority Journal; Waste Water; Waste Water Management; Animal; Bivalve; Longevity; Sewage; Water Pollutant; Wetland; Bivalvia; Suidae; Animals; Longevity; Swine; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Molluscs; Phosphorus; Wastewater reclamation; Mass balance; Phosphorus removal; Plant uptake; Removal mechanism; Subsurface Flow; Swine wastewater; Treatment performance; Wastewater purification; Wetlands; calcium; phosphorus; concentration (composition); constructed wetland; performance assessment; pollutant removal; purification; subsurface flow; wastewater treatment; Article; clam; effluent; Meretrix lyrata; nonhuman; Paspalum; Paspalum atratum; pig; priority journal; waste water; waste water management; animal; bivalve; longevity; sewage; water pollutant; wetland; Bivalvia; Suidae; Animals; Longevity; Swine; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Phosphorus; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [grant number 105.99-2018.13, 2018], and Asia Research Center, Vietnam National University, Hanoi (ARC-VNU) and Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS) [grant number CA.18.11A, 2018].

An analysis of responses found that the self-reported food waste generation rate in Hanoi averaged 1192 g/day/household in urban areas and 1694 g/day/household in rural areas; cooking waste generated during meal processing/preparation accounts for more than 70% of the total; less than 20% of respondents separated out kitchen waste for reuse/recycling before disposal; expiration dates and deteriorating quality were cited as primary reasons for food waste at home in contrast with larger portions and over-ordering outside the home; leftover food is used indirectly as animal feed in urban areas and directly in rural areas; and most respondents indicate a willingness to reduce, reuse, and recycle food waste. To achieve SDG target 12.3, policymakers and practitioners must develop comprehensive food waste policies and actions targeting the entire supply chain, implement practical food waste management systems, and promote sufficiency strategies for saving food, reducing food waste, and maintaining health and well-being. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Food Waste; Hanoi; Households; Lifestyle; Sdgs; Domestic Waste; Policy Analysis; Qualitative Analysis; Questionnaire Survey; Supply Chain Management; Sustainable Development Goal; Urban Area; Waste Management; Willingness To Pay; Hanoi; Viet Nam; Animalia","domestic waste; policy analysis; qualitative analysis; questionnaire survey; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal; urban area; waste management; willingness to pay; Hanoi; Viet Nam; Animalia","","","Funding: This research was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-16) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan “Policy Design and Evaluation to Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns in the Asian Region” (2016–2020), and the IGES SRF Fund 2020.","State of Food and Agriculture 2019 Moving Forward on Food Loss and Waste Reduction, (2019); Beretta, Claudio, Quantifying food losses and the potential for reduction in Switzerland, Waste Management, 33, 3, pp. 764-773, (2013); Food Wastage Footprint Climate Change, (2015); Food Wastage Footprint Full Cost Accounting, (2014); State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015 Meeting the 2015 International Hunger Targets Taking Stock of Uneven Progress, (2015); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2025); Poore, Joseph, Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers, Science, 360, 6392, pp. 987-992, (2018); Global Food Losses and Food Waste, (2011); Fusions Definitional Framework for Food Waste, (2014); Schneider, Felicitas, Review of food waste prevention on an international level, Proceedings of Institution of Civil Engineers: Waste and Resource Management, 166, 4, pp. 187-203, (2013)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089852708"

On one hand, renewable energies have turned to the first choice of system operators. On the other hand, the system should provide the required infrastructure to appropriately accommodate such energy sources. In this respect, microgrids (MG) would provide the needed conditions for integrating renewable energy sources (RESs). Thus, the optimal energy management of such systems in the presence of highly uncertain renewable power generation is of great importance. Accordingly, this paper provides a stochastic programming framework for the optimal scheduling of an MG equipped with RESs and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The power sources considered include a wind energy system in the form of wind turbine (WT), a solar photovoltaic (PV) system, a fuel cell (FC), a microturbine (MT), besides a battery storage system (BSS). The mentioned problem is formulated as a single-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing the total operating cost over the scheduling period. The MG is considered in the grid-connected mode where it can transact power with the upstream system. The uncertainty of the problem is due to the intermittent power output of the wind energy system and the PV unit, as well as uncertain behavior of the EV owners in charging/discharging their vehicles. The proposed stochastic optimization problem is the solved using an effective and efficient optimization algorithm named “modified harmony search (MHS) algorithm”. Finally, the simulation results are discussed and the superior performance of the suggested algorithm is verified through making a comprehensive comparison with some well-known methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Microgrid; Plug-in Electric Vehicle; Renewable Energy; Stochastic Scheduling; Vehicle-2-grid; Electromagnetic Wave Emission; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Fossil Fuels; Fuel Cells; Fuel Storage; Microgrids; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Scheduling; Solar Power Generation; Stochastic Programming; Stochastic Systems; Wind Power; Alternative Energy Source; Comprehensive Comparisons; Modified Harmony Search Algorithms; Modified Harmony Searches; Renewable Power Generation; Single Objective Optimization Problems; Solar Photovoltaic System; Stochastic Optimization Problems; Solar Cells","Electromagnetic wave emission; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Microgrids; Plug-in electric vehicles; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Alternative energy source; Comprehensive comparisons; Modified harmony search algorithms; Modified harmony searches; Renewable power generation; Single objective optimization problems; Solar photovoltaic system; Stochastic optimization problems; Solar cells","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University through the Fast-track Research Funding Program.; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61702075 ), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. 2018QNRC001 ).; Funding text 3: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61702075), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. 2018QNRC001).

The CeO<inf>2</inf> flowers were prepared using hydrothermal method and then NiO was loaded on the CeO<inf>2</inf> flowers by impregnation method. The Paper-structured catalysts (PSCs) were prepared from alumina-silica fibers and the CeO<inf>2</inf>–NiO flowers using conventional paper making method. The loaded NiO particles were uniformly dispersed on the CeO<inf>2</inf> flowers with the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone as a dispersion enhancer, which was observed by FE-SEM and EDX analysis. The NiO particles were then reduced into Ni by using H<inf>2</inf>. The PSCs containing CeO<inf>2</inf>–Ni flowers with various Ni contents (2.1, 3.4, and 4.6%) were used for dry reforming of CH<inf>4</inf>. It was found that 3.4% amount of Ni on the PSC was suitable for reforming reaction, and the higher amount of Ni (4.6%) did not increase the CH<inf>4</inf> conversion. The PSC with the CeO<inf>2</inf> flowers had porous structure and large surface area leading to the better dispersion of the Ni particles with smaller size. This helped increase in catalytic performance, prevention of agglomerated particle catalysts at high temperature and coke forming after a long time operation. The CH<inf>4</inf> conversion of the PSCs containing CeO<inf>2</inf>–NiO flowers in the dry reforming of CH<inf>4</inf> was much higher (nearly 90%) with a smaller Ni content in comparison with the PSC without the CeO<inf>2</inf> flowers (with higher Ni content of 8.6%). Moreover, the PSCs with the flowers exhibited an excellent catalytic stability with the degradation of CH<inf>4</inf> conversion of only 3.1% after 50 h of reforming. In addition, the high oxygen storage capacity and oxygen mobility of CeO<inf>2</inf> resulted in a partial removal of coke forming on the catalyst particles during reforming. This indicated that the catalytic activity of the Ni particles dispersed on the CeO<inf>2</inf> flowers for dry reforming of CH<inf>4</inf> was superior to that of various Ni-based catalyst systems which had much higher Ni contents. Therefore, it is possible to use the PSCs containing CeO<inf>2</inf>–Ni flowers to generate hydrogen for use as fuels from dry reforming of CH<inf>4</inf>. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo2 Flowers; Dry Reforming; Paper-structured Catalysts; Alumina; Aluminum Oxide; Catalyst Activity; Catalytic Reforming; Cerium Oxide; Coke; Hydrogen Fuels; Hydrogen Production; Nanocatalysts; Nickel Oxide; Oxygen; Particle Size Analysis; Silica; Agglomerated Particles; Alumina-silica Fibers; Catalytic Performance; Dry Reforming-of-methane; Hydrothermal Methods; Impregnation Methods; Poly Vinyl Pyrrolidone; Production Of Hydrogen; Nickel; Aluminum Oxide; Conversion; Flowers; Particles","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catalyst activity; Catalytic reforming; Cerium oxide; Coke; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Nanocatalysts; Nickel oxide; Oxygen; Particle size analysis; Silica; Agglomerated particles; Alumina-silica fibers; Catalytic performance; Dry reforming-of-methane; Hydrothermal methods; Impregnation methods; Poly vinyl pyrrolidone; Production of hydrogen; Nickel; Aluminum Oxide; Conversion; Flowers; Particles","","","Funding text 1: This research is funded by Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) under grant number B2017-32-01.

A multinomial logit model is used to analyze individuals’ choice of travel mode from a dataset collected via a questionnaire-based household travel survey in 2016 and the geospatial data of BE variables; the dataset contains 762 responses from local residents in ten districts of the Hanoi Metropolitan Area about their daily travel episodes. It also examines a spatial aggregation effect by comparing model performances among four buffering distances and ward-zones. The results showed that (1) a higher population density around an individual’s home is associated with more bus use and less motorbike and car use; (2) mixed land use around the home, average tax revenue near the home, and bus frequency at the workplace have positive relationships with bus ridership; (3) senior people, students, or unskilled laborers tend to use the bus; (4) the spatial aggregation bias significantly affects the estimation results; and (5) new immigrants tend to choose to reside in areas designed for automobile users. Finally, there are several policy implications for transit-oriented development (TOD) in Hanoi, including: (1) parking regulations and/or control strategies should be jointly incorporated into the Hanoi’s TOD policy; (2) Hanoi’s TOD policy should be carefully designed in terms of its scope of development site and type; and (3) a polycentric structure strategy only may not be sufficient for increasing public transit ridership. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Built Environment; Hanoi; Transit-oriented Development; Travel Mode Choice; Buffering; Estimation Method; Household Survey; Immigrant; Metropolitan Area; Ownership; Population Density; Questionnaire Survey; Spatial Analysis; Strategic Approach; Travel Behavior; Workplace; Hanoi; Viet Nam","buffering; estimation method; household survey; immigrant; metropolitan area; ownership; population density; questionnaire survey; spatial analysis; strategic approach; travel behavior; workplace; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","","Sustainable Transport Studies in Asia Lecture Notes in Mobility, (2013); Sustainable Urban Transport in an Asian Context, (2010); Kato, Hironori, Development assistance to transportation in Asian developing countries, pp. 495-520, (2018); Transport Development in Asian Megacities, (2013); Zusman, Eric, Low Carbon Transport in Asia: Strategies for Optimizing Co-benefits, pp. 1-269, (2012); Transforming Cities with Transit Transit and Land Use Integration for Sustainable Urban Development, (2013); Cervero, Robert B., Linking urban transport and land use in developing countries, Journal of Transport and Land Use, 6, 1, pp. 7-24, (2013); Drilling, Matthias, Planning sustainable cities: Why environmental policy needs social policy, pp. 103-119, (2013); Trudeau, Dan, Sustaining suburbia through new urbanism: Toward growing, green, and just suburbs?, Urban Planning, 3, 4, pp. 50-60, (2018); White, Stacey Swearingen, Sustainability, the environment, and new urbanism: An assessment and agenda for research, Journal of Architectural and Planning Research, 24, 2, pp. 125-142, (2007)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095571677"

The SBK production process was developed in keeping with the conditions of the available technologies and investment while leveraging the advantage of an abundant national feedstock resource that is found in Indonesia in particular, and tropical emerging countries in general. The production of SBK comprises two main processes: saponification and thermal decarboxylation to convert coconut oil into hydrocarbons. The composition of SBK was analyzed and compared to that of Jet A1. Additionally, the critical properties of SBK and several of its blends with Jet A1 were measured and collated with the established jet fuel standard. The results show that SBK can be blended directly with Jet A1 at up to 10 vol.% to meet selected properties: distillation temperature, flash point, density, net heating value, viscosity, freezing point, smoke point, and oxidation stability. From this study, it can be concluded that SBK is feasible for use as a drop-in aviation fuel when blended with conventional jet fuel. Thus, the SBK production is highly promising for use in tropical countries to produce aviation biofuels, given the appropriate technologies and feedstock resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aviation Alternative Fuel; Aviation Biofuel; Decarboxylation; Saponification; Soap-derived Biokerosene; Alternative Fuels; Carboxylation; Distillation; Feedstocks; Hydrocarbons; Jet Fuel; Smoke; Tropics; Appropriate Technologies; Critical Properties; Distillation Temperature; Emerging Countries; Feedstock Resources; Oxidation Stability; Thermal Decarboxylation; Tropical Countries; Petroleum Industry","Alternative fuels; Carboxylation; Distillation; Feedstocks; Hydrocarbons; Jet fuel; Smoke; Tropics; Appropriate technologies; Critical properties; Distillation temperature; Emerging countries; Feedstock resources; Oxidation stability; Thermal decarboxylation; Tropical countries; Petroleum industry","","","We gratefully acknowledge the ASEAN University Network Southeast Asian Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net) project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for their financial support.

In clinical application, calcite nano-particle has to be useful for recovering the surface of tooth. The surface of tooth was often damaged due to wrong tooth care treatment, dental caries and periodontal disease. Because of tooth surface destruction, it could lead to dental hypersensitivity. It is desirable to find a suitable source for supplying calcium to fill in dentinal tubules and later regenerate the tooth surface. This study demonstrated the synthesis and characterization of calcite nanoparticle for its application in dental hypersensitivity treatment. Cockleshell was found to be a suitable source to synthesize calcite. Using cockleshell as raw materials to produce calcite nanoparticle is meaningful for both environmental protection and biomedical application. Therefore, in this study, calcite nano-particle was synthesized using cockleshell as a reproducibility source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and chitosan as a size-reducing agent. Xray Diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize phase composition of raw materials, as-prepared powder and calcined powder. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the size and morphology of powder. Results indicated that calcite nano-particle with size about 50-100 nm could be obtained.

The aim of this study is to match the electricity demand with the intermittent solar-based renewable resources profile and to minimize the energy cost. The main contribution of the proposed model addresses uncertainties of the thermal load in smart buildings by considering detailed types of loads such as hot water, heating, and ventilation loads. In smart grids, buildings are no longer passive consumers. They are controllable loads, which can be used for demand-side energy management. Smart homes, as a domain of Internet of Things (IoT), enable energy systems of the buildings to operate as an active load in smart grids. The proposed formulation is cast as a stochastic MILP model for a 24-h horizon in order to minimize the total energy cost. In this study, Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to generate 1000 random scenarios for two environmental factors: the outdoor temperature, and solar radiation. Therefore in the proposed model, the thermal load, the output power of the photovoltaic panel, solar collector power generation, and electricity load become stochastic parameters.

This has increased awareness amongst Vietnamese farmers for conducting shrimp farming according to specific certification guidelines. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the situation of quality control and effectiveness of Good Aquaculture Practices (GAP) in Vietnam (VietGAP) for intensive shrimp systems by making a comparison between VietGAP and non-GAP applied farms. The farmers in the GAP system performed well on seven control points related to quality management, especially regarding reservoir construction, water monitoring, and chemical use. Of the farms, 49% reported disease, and the ratio of safety rejections was low. The farmers in non-GAP farms appeared to have weak practices in quality control with high usage of antibiotics, leading to 64% of farmers reporting disease and 20% of tested shipments being rejected. The VietGAP applied system has the potential to deal with disease and quality problems to increase export opportunity for Vannamei shrimp. However, VietGAP does not generate a high price premium in itself because it is not a recognized certificate in the global markets. The results reinforce previous findings regarding eco-certification and how it can be a useful tool to reduce small-scale producers' risk, even though it does not necessarily generate a price premium. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diseases; Eco-certification; Food Safety; Litopenaeus Vannamei; Quality Management; Vietgap; Whiteleg Shrimp; Agricultural Practice; Antibiotics; Crustacean; Food Safety; Quality Control; Reservoir; Small Scale Industry; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Decapoda (crustacea); Litopenaeus Vannamei","agricultural practice; antibiotics; crustacean; food safety; quality control; reservoir; small scale industry; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Decapoda (Crustacea); Litopenaeus vannamei","","","Funding text 1: Soc Trang is one of the largest commercial-shrimp-producing areas in the MD with its contribution of 134,184 MT over 54,098 ha in 2018.

In this study, the contributing behavior of the oil/water interaction to the oil recovery process was investigated through core- A nd microscale experiments involving high-polar-component oil. Two tertiary coreflood experiments with high- A nd low-salinity water were conducted using cores from the same reservoir formation, where the behavior of oil recovery and that of differential pressure differed significantly. The results of core and water analyses indicate that the emulsions predominantly caused this difference. Thus, microfluidic experiments were conducted to visualize the emulsion-based oil recovery mechanisms; two phenomena of emulsions contributed to oil recovery: Pore blockage and microwater dispersion. In addition, we studied the stability of emulsions in terms of the surface electric charge through the use of ζ potential measurements; emulsions were more stable in the lower salinity and higher pH conditions. These experimental results demonstrate that emulsions are important during LSWF for additional oil recovery in water-wet porous media. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emulsification; Oil Well Flooding; Ostwald Ripening; Porous Materials; Secondary Recovery; Coreflood Experiments; Differential Pressures; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Oil Recovery Mechanisms; Oil Recovery Process; Reservoir Formation; Surface Electric Charge; Zeta Potential Measurements; Enhanced Recovery","Emulsification; Oil well flooding; Ostwald ripening; Porous materials; Secondary recovery; Coreflood experiments; Differential pressures; Enhanced oil recovery; Oil recovery mechanisms; Oil recovery process; Reservoir formation; Surface electric charge; Zeta potential measurements; Enhanced recovery","","","","Robbana, Enis, Low salinity enhanced oil recovery - Laboratory to day one field implementation - LoSal EOR into the Clair Ridge Project, 4, pp. 2582-2596, (2012); Awolayo, Adedapo Noah, Brine-dependent recovery processes in carbonate and sandstone petroleum reservoirs: Review of laboratory-field studies, interfacial mechanisms and modeling attempts, Energies, 11, 11, (2018); SPE California Regional Meeting, (1967); Tang, Guoqing, Influence of brine composition and fines migration on crude oil/brine/rock interactions and oil recovery, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 24, 2-4, pp. 99-111, (1999); McGuire, Patrick L., Low salinity oil recovery: An exciting new EOR opportunity for Alaska's north slope, pp. 439-453, (2005); RezaeiDoust, Alireza R., Smart water as wettability modifier in carbonate and sandstone: A discussion of similarities/differences in the chemical mechanisms, Energy and Fuels, 23, 9, pp. 4479-4485, (2009); Lager, Arnaud, Low salinity oil recovery - An experimental investigation, Petrophysics, 49, 1, pp. 28-35, (2008); Austad, Tor A., Chemical mechanism of low salinity water flooding in sandstone reservoirs, Proceedings - SPE Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery, 1, pp. 679-695, (2010); Ligthelm, Dick J., Novel waterflooding strategy by manipulation of injection brine composition (SPE-119835), 2, pp. 1313-1335, (2009); Emadi, Alireza, Visual investigation of oil recovery by low salinity water injection: Formation of water micro-dispersions and wettability alteration, SPE Annual Technical Conference Proceedings, 6, pp. 4168-4182, (2013)","","American Chemical Society service@acs.org","","","","","","15205029; 08870624","","ENFUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081324358"

The main contribution of this research is the comparative evaluation of on-grid decentralized or distributed renewable-powered desalination systems for sustainable water and energy supply planning. Applying a novel nexus approach, an interactive multi-period planning model is developed to highlight synergies and to identify conflicts of planning both energy and water sectors at the same time as endogenous subsystems of one overall system. For studying these synergies in this study, the pace of technology deployment and the path of decline in overall costs are assumed to be a function of experience and knowledge as two-factor learning curves. Using data from 81 projects, the levelized cost and capacity factor of utility-scale photovoltaic and wind supplies in the Middle East were calculated. The results indicate that a scenario with a decentralized water sector and renewable-powered multiple-effect distillation technology has the best overall performance among the proposed scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decentralized Desalination; Long-term Planning; Short-term Scheduling; Two-factor Learning Curve; Variable Renewable Energy; Water-energy-nexus; Alternative Energy; Decentralization; Desalination; Distillation; Economic Analysis; Energy Planning; Environmental Impact; Integrated Approach; Performance Assessment; Photovoltaic System; Research Work; Sustainability; Technical Efficiency; Water Storage; Water Supply; Middle East","alternative energy; decentralization; desalination; distillation; economic analysis; energy planning; environmental impact; integrated approach; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; research work; sustainability; technical efficiency; water storage; water supply; Middle East","","","For the water sector, according to the Iranian Sixth National Development Plan, the Ministry of Energy is assigned to propose a plan for transferring required knowledge and providing sufficient financial support toward supplying 70% of the urban water demand on the shoreline of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman by 2021 from desalination [61].

We herein present the formation of self-assembled monolayers of tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)methane (TEPM) having a three-dimensional (3D) tetrapod geometry on HOPG, which was achieved by utilizing a simple spin-coating method. The arrangements of TEPM molecules in the monolayers were investigated using frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM). The resulting subnanometer-resolution FM-AFM images revealed that the TEPM molecules formed linear rows with a periodicity of 0.85 nm oriented in a parallel configuration but with two alternating intervals of 0.7 and 1.0 nm. Moreover, the TEPM monolayers were classified into two chiral types with a relationship of mutual mirror-image symmetry, according to the observed molecular arrangements. Our results demonstrate the capability of TEPM molecules to act as 3D building blocks for the design of molecular-scale architectures at interfaces. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Frequency Modulation; Graphite; Molecules; Monolayers; Organic Polymers; Conjugated Structures; Frequency Modulation Atomic Force Microscopy; Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite; Mirror-image Symmetry; Molecular Arrangements; Parallel Configuration; Subnanometer Resolution; Threedimensional (3-d); Stereochemistry","Frequency modulation; Graphite; Molecules; Monolayers; Organic polymers; Conjugated structures; Frequency modulation atomic force microscopy; Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite; Mirror-image symmetry; Molecular arrangements; Parallel configuration; Subnanometer resolution; Threedimensional (3-d); Stereochemistry","","","We acknowledge financial support from JST PRESTO, Japan (grant nos.

The degradation rate of the solar cell performances is slowed down by the UV light irradiation in the 300–390 nm wavelength range during PID test. The conductivity increase of the silicon nitride (SiN<inf>x</inf>) anti-reflection coating (ARC) layer on the solar cell surface under UV light irradiation during PID tests, which relates to the mechanism preventing the penetration of sodium ions into the active cell layer, induces the PID delay effect for the p-type c-Si solar cells. The PID delay effect was also analyzed by a microwave photo-conductance decay (μ-PCD) technique in this work. The reduction behavior of the components in the μ-PCD signal curves including rapid (τ<inf>1</inf>) and slow (τ<inf>2</inf>) decay time constants and the effective lifetime (τ<inf>eff</inf>) presents a good correlation with the performance degradation behavior of the solar cells over PID test duration. Moreover, the reduction rate of these components is also slowed down under the UV light irradiation in the 300–390 nm wavelength range during PID tests. Notably, their reduction behavior was compatible with the mechanism of the conductivity increase of the SiN<inf>x</inf> ARC layer under UV light irradiation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Microwave Photo-conductance Decay; Potential Induced Degradation (pid); Silicon Nitride (sinx); Silicon Solar Cells; Uv Irradiation; Antireflection Coatings; Cell Membranes; Degradation; Irradiation; Metal Ions; Microwave Irradiation; Nitrides; Photodegradation; Radiation; Reflective Coatings; Semiconductor Materials; Silicon Nitride; Testing; Conductance Decays; Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells; Crystalline Silicons; Induced Degradation; Performance Degradation; Solar Cell Performance; Ultraviolet Light Irradiation; Uv Irradiation; Silicon Solar Cells; Crystallinity; Electrical Conductivity; Fuel Cell; Irradiation; Microwave Radiation; Nitrite; Photodegradation; Photovoltaic System; Silicon; Ultraviolet Radiation","Antireflection coatings; Cell membranes; Degradation; Irradiation; Metal ions; Microwave irradiation; Nitrides; Photodegradation; Radiation; Reflective coatings; Semiconductor materials; Silicon nitride; Testing; Conductance decays; Crystalline silicon solar cells; Crystalline silicons; Induced degradation; Performance degradation; Solar cell performance; Ultraviolet light irradiation; UV irradiation; Silicon solar cells; crystallinity; electrical conductivity; fuel cell; irradiation; microwave radiation; nitrite; photodegradation; photovoltaic system; silicon; ultraviolet radiation","","","This work was supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan.","Bae, Soohyun, Potential induced degradation of n-type crystalline silicon solar cells with p+ front junction, Energy Science and Engineering, 5, 1, pp. 30-37, (2017); Bag, Atanu, Polycrystalline p-β-FeSi2(Al) on n-Si(100): Heterojunction thin-film solar cells, pp. 285-287, (2012); Bag, Atanu, Interlayer thickness dependence of photovoltaic properties of polycrystalline p-β-FeSi2(Al)/n-Si(100) heterojunctions, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, 6, 2, (2014); Berger, Bastian, Contactless electrical defect characterization in semiconductors by microwave detected photo induced current transient spectroscopy (MD-PICTS) and microwave detected photoconductivity (MDP), Physica Status Solidi (A) Applications and Materials Science, 208, 4, pp. 769-776, (2011); Chen, Yang-Fang, Stretched-exponential law for carrier capture kinetics of a trapping center in compensated amorphous silicon, Physical Review B-Condensed Matter, 40, 5, pp. 3437-3438, (1989); Dong, Nguyenchung, The influence of sodium ions decorated micro-cracks on the evolution of potential induced degradation in p-type crystalline silicon solar cells, Solar Energy, 174, pp. 1-6, (2018); Fuyuki, Takashi, Analytic findings in the electroluminescence characterization of crystalline silicon solar cells, Journal of Applied Physics, 101, 2, (2007); 25th Eupvsec, (2010); Hacke, Peter L., Interlaboratory study to determine repeatability of the damp-heat test method for potential-induced degradation and polarization in crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 5, 1, pp. 94-101, (2015); Hara, Koujirou, Potential-induced degradation in photovoltaic modules based on n-type single crystalline Si solar cells, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 140, pp. 361-365, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","0038092X","","SRENA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079195057"

In this study, a novel hybrid soft computing model (RF-PSO) of random forest (RF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was developed and used to estimate the undrained shear strength of soil based on the clay content (%), moisture content (%), specific gravity (%), void ratio (%), liquid limit (%), and plastic limit (%). In this study, the experimental results of 127 soil samples from national highway project Hai Phong-Thai Binh of Vietnam were used to generate datasets for training and validating models. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) method was used to evaluate and compare performance of the proposed model with single RF model. The results show that the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) achieved a high accuracy performance (R = 0.89) in the prediction of shear strength of soil. Validation of the models also indicated that RF-PSO model (R = 0.89 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.453) is superior to the single RF model without optimization (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.48). Thus, the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) can be used for accurate estimation of shear strength which can be used for the suitable designing of civil engineering structures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning; Particle Swarm Optimization; Random Forest; Vietnam; Estimation Method; Foundation; Model Validation; Numerical Model; Optimization; Shear Strength; Soil Property; Hai Phong; Thai Binh; Viet Nam","estimation method; foundation; model validation; numerical model; optimization; shear strength; soil property; Hai Phong; Thai Binh; Viet Nam","","","","Poulos, Harry G., Design of reinforcing piles to increase slope stability, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 32, 5, pp. 808-818, (1995); Liu, Yaojun, Effects of vegetation on runoff generation, sediment yield and soil shear strength on road-side slopes under a simulation rainfall test in the three gorges reservoir area, China, Science of the Total Environment, 485-486, 1, pp. 93-102, (2014); Hettiarachchi, Hiroshan, Use of SPT blow counts to estimate shear strength properties of soils: Energy balance approach, Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering - ASCE, 135, 6, pp. 830-834, (2009); Motaghedi, Hossein, Analytical Approach for Determination of Soil Shear Strength Parameters from CPT and CPTu Data, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 39, 6, pp. 4363-4376, (2014); Cha, Minsu, Shear strength estimation of sandy soils using shear wave velocity, Geotechnical Testing Journal, 30, 6, pp. 484-495, (2007); Garven, E.

We have found that a single NO molecule preferably adsorbs in an upright N-down configuration at the fcc-hollow site, whereas all constituent NO molecules of the NO dimer and trimer adsorb at the fcc-hollow sites, in inclined N-down geometries. Among three NO clusters, the NO trimer is the most stable regardless of lateral periodicities, in good agreement with the scanning tunneling microscopy experiment. van der Waals interaction dominates the stabilization of the NO dimer, while the hybridization among 2π∗ orbitals of NO plays an important role in addition to the van der Waals interaction in the formation of the NO trimer. The relatively weak interaction between the NO and Cu substrate is crucial for the stabilization of the NO trimer. Our vibrational analysis has revealed that the N-O stretching mode is blue-shifted from monomer to trimer, and the latter agrees well with the electron energy loss spectroscopy data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blue Shift; Dimers; Electron Energy Levels; Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy; Electron Scattering; Energy Dissipation; Molecules; Nitric Oxide; Scanning Tunneling Microscopy; Stabilization; Van Der Waals Forces; Blue-shifted; Density Functional Theory Studies; Density Functionals; Stretching Modes; Van Der Waals; Van Der Waals Interactions; Vibrational Analysis; Weak Interactions; Density Functional Theory","Blue shift; Dimers; Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron scattering; Energy dissipation; Molecules; Nitric oxide; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Stabilization; Van der Waals forces; Blue-shifted; Density functional theory studies; Density functionals; Stretching modes; Van der waals; Van Der Waals interactions; Vibrational analysis; Weak interactions; Density functional theory","","","We would like to thank Professors Hiroshi Okuyama and Akitoshi Shiotari for valuable discussions.

Based on articles retrieved from the Web of Science database during the period 1992-2018, we found that the number of scientific publications, international collaborations, and allocated funds regarding depressive disorder among university students in China (97 articles, 43 international collaborations, and 52 funds provided, respectively) overwhelmingly surpassed the case of Korea (37 articles, 12 international collaborations, and 15 funds provided, respectively) and Japan (24 articles, 5 international collaborations, and 6 funds provided, respectively). The differences in collaboration patterns (p-value < 0.05) and the proportion of allocated funds (p-value < 0.05) among Korea, Japan, and China were also noted using Fisher's exact test. Based on the Poisson regression analysis, China's associations of scientific impact with international collaboration (β =-0.322, p-value < 0.01) and funding provision (β =-0.397, p-value < 0.01) are negative, while associations of the scientific impact and scientific quality with funding provision and international collaboration were statistically insignificant. These findings hint that Korea and Japan lacked scientific output, diversity in research targets, international collaboration, and funding provision, compared to China, but the quality of either China's internationally collaborated or funded articles was contentious. As a result, policymakers in Korea and Japan are suggested to raise the importance of mental health problems in their future policy planning and resource distribution. Moreover, it would be advisable to establish a rigorous system of evaluation for the quality of internationally collaborated and funded studies in order to increase scientific impact and maintain public trust, especially in China. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Depressive Disorder; Funding; International Collaboration; Japan; Korea; Scientific Impact; Scientific Output; Scientific Quality; University Student; Mental Health; Policy Approach; Policy Making; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Student; University Sector; Far East","mental health; policy approach; policy making; spatiotemporal analysis; student; university sector; Far East","","","","undefined, (2019); undefined, (2019); Ibrahim, Ahmed K., A systematic review of studies of depression prevalence in university students, Journal of Psychiatric Research, 47, 3, pp. 391-400, (2013); Vu, Huyen Thi Thanh, Depressive symptoms among elderly diabetic patients in Vietnam, Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity, 11, pp. 659-665, (2018); Vu, Thuc Minh Thi, Socioeconomic vulnerability to depressive symptoms in patients with chronic hepatitis B, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 2, (2019); Simon, Gregory E., Risk of suicide attempt and suicide death following completion of the patient health questionnaire depression module in community practice, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 77, 2, pp. 221-227, (2016); Pan, Yiju, Longitudinal risk factors for suicidal thoughts in depressed and non-depressed young adolescents, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 51, 9, pp. 930-937, (2017); Miller, Adam Bryant, A within-person approach to risk for suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior: Examining the roles of depression, stress, and abuse exposure, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 85, 7, pp. 712-722, (2017); Jenkins, Rachel, Global mental health and sustainable development 2018, BJPsych International, 16, 2, pp. 34-37, (2019); Tran, Bach Xuan, Indices of change, expectations, and popularity of biological treatments for major depressive disorder between 1988 and 2017: A scientometric analysis, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 13, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081201752"

Gas crossover leads to heat and water generations without conducting any useful works, hence increasing fuel consumption. Particularly, Gas crossover can result in the degradation and formation of pinholes inside the membrane. Therefore, the gas crossover is a critical factor significantly affecting the durability of a fuel cell and quality of the membrane. Herein, we numerically investigate the effects of gas crossover across the membrane in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. A two-dimensional, two-phase, steady state model of the gas crossover using the partial differential equation solver FreeFem++, was built to investigate the crossover characteristics of hydrogen and oxygen across the membrane versus changes in operating conditions and various geometric structure of components in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Results indicated that higher equivalent weight of Nafion® is required to significantly decrease gas crossover phenomenon while the cell performance was reduced negligibly. In addition, as the increase in the stoichiometric flow ratio and channel length, the gas crossover decreased and the cell performance improved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Freefem++; Hydrogen Crossover; Membrane Degradation; Oxygen Crossover; Pem Fuel Cell; Gases; Geometry; Membranes; Cross-over Phenomena; Freefem; Geometric Structure; Membrane Degradation; Operating Condition; Partial Differential; Pem Fuel Cell; Steady-state Modeling; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (pemfc); Degradation; Fuel Cell; Geometry; Hydrogen; Membrane; Numerical Model; Oxygen","Gases; Geometry; Membranes; Cross-over phenomena; FreeFem; Geometric structure; Membrane degradation; Operating condition; Partial differential; PEM fuel cell; Steady-state modeling; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); degradation; fuel cell; geometry; hydrogen; membrane; numerical model; oxygen","","","","Shah, Akeel A., Modeling and simulation of the degradation of perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes in PEM fuel cells, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 156, 4, pp. B465-B484, (2009); Zaton, Marta, Current understanding of chemical degradation mechanisms of perfluorosulfonic acid membranes and their mitigation strategies: A review, Sustainable Energy and Fuels, 1, 3, pp. 409-438, (2017); Nam, Jinmoo, Numerical analysis of gas crossover effects in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), Applied Energy, 87, 12, pp. 3699-3709, (2010); Chippar, Purushothama, Numerical modeling and investigation of gas crossover effects in high temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 38, 18, pp. 7704-7714, (2013); Schalenbach, Maximilian, Pressurized PEM water electrolysis: Efficiency and gas crossover, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 38, 35, pp. 14921-14933, (2013); Seddiq, Mehdi, Numerical analysis of gas cross-over through the membrane in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, Journal of Power Sources, 161, 1, pp. 371-379, (2006); Ito, Hiroshi, Properties of Nafion membranes under PEM water electrolysis conditions, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 36, 17, pp. 10527-10540, (2011); Ogumi, Zempachi, Gas Permeation in SPE Method II.

The system is developed on the basis of material and energy exchange potentials between the wastewater and exhaust gas flows, and the use of available firewood ash as material for absorption. Two operation modes were presented aiming at a complete treatment of wastewater and exhaust gases as required by the Vietnamese national standards, and the recovery of valuable components in the system (N, P) for obtaining value-added products (such as fertilizer, irrigation water, etc.). In addition, the maximization of potentials on existing natural conditions at the local family, the avoidance of chemicals used in the system etc. have also helped to lower the investment and operation costs of the treatment facilities. The application of this system also contributes to the “greening” of the rice production chain in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam and is an example for a local closed cycle economy.

However, it is also reported that Ni-based catalysts generally show less resistance to the carbonaceous deposition, which ultimately causes their rapid deactivation during the reaction. One possible solution to improve the coke resistance is the addition of a promoter to the catalyst, which has shown successful results to reduce the coke formation. Therefore, this study also aimed to prepare boron-promoted Ni-based catalysts and investigate their efficiency for DRM reactions. A series of different catalysts with 10% nickel and x% boron (x: 1%, 2%, 3%, and 5%) were prepared by using an ordered mesoporous silica as a support and tested in DRM. The results demonstrated that boron-promoted Ni/SBA-15 catalysts obtained significant catalytic activity for CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> conversions. Meanwhile, it was noticed that a lower concentration of boron (1 and 2%) was more favourable to achieve higher catalytic activity, whereas the higher concentration (3% and 5%) resulted in a comparatively lower conversion for CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf>. Evidently, the higher activity of 2% B-promoted catalyst was ascribed to the synergistic effect of high surface area and lower crystallite size that greatly improved the active sites accessibility. Moreover, the results confirmed 14% carbon deposition on unpromoted (NS) catalyst and it was reduced to 1.3% for 2% boron-promoted catalyst owing to the presence of B-OH species on catalyst surface. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boron Promoter; Dry Reforming Of Methane; Hydrogen; Ni Catalyst; Syngas; Boron; Carbon Dioxide; Catalytic Reforming; Coke; Crystallite Size; Deposition; Hydrogen; Methane; Nickel; Nickel Compounds; Silica; Catalytic Performance; Dry Reforming-of-methane; Heterogeneous Catalyst; Hydrocarbon Reforming; Ni Catalysts; Ni/sba-15 Catalysts; Ordered Mesoporous Silicas; Syn-gas; Catalyst Activity","Boron; Carbon dioxide; Catalytic reforming; Coke; Crystallite size; Deposition; Hydrogen; Methane; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Silica; Catalytic performance; Dry reforming-of-methane; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydrocarbon reforming; Ni catalysts; Ni/SBA-15 catalysts; Ordered mesoporous silicas; Syn-gas; Catalyst activity","","","This work was financially supported by the Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia (UMP Research Grant Scheme, RDU170326 ).","Li, Dalin, Methane reforming to synthesis gas over Ni catalysts modified with noble metals, Applied Catalysis A: General, 408, 1-2, pp. 1-24, (2011); Siang, Tan Ji, Hydrogen production from CH4 dry reforming over bimetallic Ni–Co/Al2O3 catalyst, Journal of the Energy Institute, 91, 5, pp. 683-694, (2018); Li, Xinyu, Dry reforming of methane over Ni/La2O3 nanorod catalysts with stabilized Ni nanoparticles, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 202, pp. 683-694, (2017); Yao, Lu, Synthesis Gas Production via Dry Reforming of Methane over Manganese Promoted Nickel/Cerium-Zirconium Oxide Catalyst, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 57, 49, pp. 16645-16656, (2018); Li, Shuirong, Strategies for improving the performance and stability of Ni-based catalysts for reforming reactions, Chemical Society Reviews, 43, 21, pp. 7245-7256, (2014); Li, Di, Ceria-promoted Ni/SBA-15 catalysts for ethanol steam reforming with enhanced activity and resistance to deactivation, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 176-177, pp. 532-541, (2015); Yang, Yongxing, Ce-promoted Ni/SBA-15 catalysts for anisole hydrotreating under mild conditions, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 197, pp. 206-213, (2016); de Araújo, Jesuína C.S., The effects of La2O3 on the structural properties of La2O3-Al2O3 prepared by the sol-gel method and on the catalytic performance of Pt/La2O3-Al2O3 towards steam reforming and partial oxidation of methane, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 84, 3-4, pp. 552-562, (2008); Pechimuthu, Nandini A., Deactivation studies over Ni-K/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst for dry reforming of methane, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 46, 6, pp. 1731-1736, (2007); Zhang, Liehui, Structure and Catalytic Performance of Mg-SBA-15-Supported Nickel Catalysts for CO2 Reforming of Methane to Syngas, Chemical Engineering and Technology, 36, 10, pp. 1701-1707, (2013)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","17460220; 17439671","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064465769"

Despite some technical challenges, biogas can be reformed to H <inf>2</inf>-rich fuel stream in the anodes of SOFCs. However, the reforming rate drastically drops toward the outlet of the flow field due to the rapid conversion of CH4 (biogas) in the inlet region. As the reforming reactions are endothermic, they cause large temperature gradients along the flow field, so that thermal stresses arise on the SOFC components. This problem can be resolved to an extent via taking the reforming reactions out of the SOFC domain (Indirect Internal Reforming), which however makes the heat transfer from SOFCs to the reforming domain also indirect. From the point of effective thermal integration, this study introduces an innovative indirect internal reforming concept. For totally eliminating the thermal stresses, it is necessary to homogenize the reforming rate, which can be achieved by designing a graded reforming domain. In this paper, we investigate the electrochemical performance and durability of an indirect internal reforming SOFC module featuring a graded reforming domain. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogas; Durability; Flow Fields; Heat Transfer; Reforming Reactions; Thermal Stress; Electrochemical Performance; Fuel Stream; Indirect Internal Reforming; Rapid Conversion; Renewable Power Generation; Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (sofcs); Technical Challenges; Thermal Integration; Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (sofc)","Biogas; Durability; Flow fields; Heat transfer; Reforming reactions; Thermal stress; Electrochemical performance; Fuel stream; Indirect internal reforming; Rapid conversion; Renewable power generation; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); Technical challenges; Thermal integration; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)","","","","Dicks, Andrew L., Hydrogen generation from natural gas for the fuel cell systems of tomorrow, Journal of Power Sources, 61, 1-2, pp. 113-124, (1996); Keane, Michael, LSM-YSZ interactions and anode delamination in solid oxide electrolysis cells, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 37, 22, pp. 16776-16785, (2012); Shiratori, Yusuke, Internal reforming SOFC running on biogas, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 35, 15, pp. 7905-7912, (2010); Shiratori, Yusuke, Study on paper-structured catalyst for direct internal reforming SOFC fueled by the mixture of CH4 and CO2, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 38, 25, pp. 10542-10551, (2013); Shiratori, Yusuke, Performance enhancement of biodiesel fueled SOFC using paper-structured catalyst, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 38, 23, pp. 9856-9866, (2013); Shiratori, Yusuke, Feasibility of direct-biogas SOFC, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 33, 21, pp. 6316-6321, (2008); Alves, Helton José, Overview of hydrogen production technologies from biogas and the applications in fuel cells, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 38, 13, pp. 5215-5225, (2013); Huang, Jingdang, Assessment of simulated biogas as a fuel for the spark ignition engine, Fuel, 77, 15, pp. 1793-1801, (1998); Achenbach, Elmar, Methane/steam reforming kinetics for solid oxide fuel cells, Journal of Power Sources, 52, 2, pp. 283-288, (1994); Nagata, Susumu, Numerical analysis of output characteristics of tubular SOFC with internal reformer, Journal of Power Sources, 101, 1, pp. 60-71, (2001)","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","","","","","19457111; 00134651","","JESOA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084681004"

Since these securities are interconnected, the business-as-usual approach (sectoral approach) cannot achieve them and need to apply the water-energy-food nexus approach for identifying and overcoming the roots of barriers and challenges. The study aims to prioritize interlinkages between SDG-2 (food security), SDG-6 (water security) and SDG-7 (energy security) for country action. In order to achieve this aim, the study implements a set of methods including stakeholder perception survey, network analysis, regression analysis and cross-sectorial group discussion. This article summarizes the outcomes of a case study in India. Stakeholders cognition derived through scrutinizing the perception survey admitted the need for a nexus approach in the action plans towards the SDGs. Quantitative assessment of interdependency showed that, of 182 interlinkages between SDG-2, SDG-6 and SDG-7 targets, 124 interlinkages had synergistic relation. The combined outcome of the cross-sectorial group discussion identified eight interlinkages as high priority (p>0.9) for immediate integrated planning and action. A total of ten interactions are moderate (p=0.6 to 0.9) and eight are low priority interlinkages (p<0.6). Solid understanding of synergies and trade-offs associated with SDG targets and initial prioritization of interlinkages would help India reorient its SDG priorities from a water-energy-food nexus perspective. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Country Actions; India; Sustainable Development Goals; Water-energy-food Nexus","","","","We want to thank the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) for providing generous funding to support this research.

This work researches the use of soap-derived biokerosene (SBK) in aircraft engines. SBK is a promising biofuel option for emerging tropical countries as its production requires a relatively simple technology, and its feedstock sources are abundant in these countries. Blends of Jet A-1 with up to 20 vol.% SBK were tested on a 1S/60 Rover gas turbine engine over a range of brake powers to measure engine performance and emissions. The results were then compared to those of pure Jet A-1. It shows that the engine running on SBK/Jet A-1 blends and pure Jet A-1 have almost similar engine performance parameters including engine efficiency, specific fuel consumption (SFC), turbine inlet temperature (TIT), and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). On the other hand, increasing the volume fraction of SBK in the fuel blends with Jet A-1 leads to a slight increase in carbon monoxide (CO) and HC emissions, while insignificant differences in the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were found. From this study, some valuable recommendations could be found to improve the feasibility of SBK for use as an alternative aviation fuel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aviation Alternative Fuels; Biojet Fuels; Exhaust Gas Emissions; Gas Turbine Engine Performance; Soap-derived Biokerosene; Aircraft Engines; Aircraft Propulsion; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Combustion; Fuel Consumption; Gas Turbines; Greenhouse Gases; Jet Fuel; Nitrogen Oxides; Engine Efficiency; Engine Performance; Exhaust Gas Temperatures; Performance And Emissions; Simple Technology; Specific Fuel Consumption; Tropical Countries; Turbine Inlet Temperature; Gas Emissions","Aircraft engines; Aircraft propulsion; Biofuels; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Fuel consumption; Gas turbines; Greenhouse gases; Jet fuel; Nitrogen oxides; Engine efficiency; Engine performance; Exhaust gas temperatures; Performance and emissions; SIMPLE technology; Specific fuel consumption; Tropical countries; Turbine inlet temperature; Gas emissions","","","We gratefully acknowledge the ASEAN University Network Southeast Asian Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net) project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for their financial support.

However, it still keeps a disadvantage such as the transfer distance is short which is the most difficult to eliminate. Moreover, the relative position of the transmitter and the receiver depends on the movement of the electric vehicles in the dynamic wireless charging. Therefore the average efficiency is low in the charging area when the electric vehicle runs away from the optimized position of the transfer system. In this paper, a 13.56MHz antenna is designed by the finite element analysis. At the highest efficiency, the transfer distance is 55 cm. Otherwise, the solution to improve efficiency due to the variation of the charging position is proposed. The coupling system is strongly coupled magnetic resonance technology. The impedance is dynamically matched in the transmitter to improve the transfer efficiency. In the simulation, the 91.2% highest efficiency at 55 cm is obtained and it is improved maximum of 56.4% within 55 cm transfer distance and 40 cm misalignment with the proposed solution. The experimental system can improve efficiency depending on the position of receiver and lookup data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","13.56 Mhz Antenna; Coupling System; Efficiency Improvement; Magnetic Resonance; Wireless Power Transfer","","","","","Eghtesadi, Manochehr, Inductive power transfer to an electric vehicle-analytical model, IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, pp. 100-104, (1990); Budhia, Mickel, Development of a single-sided flux magnetic coupler for electric vehicle IPT charging systems, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 60, 1, pp. 318-328, (2013); Wu, Hunter Hanzhuo, A high efficiency 5 kW inductive charger for EVs using dual side control, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 3, pp. 585-595, (2012); Lee, Sungwoo, On-Line Electric Vehicle using inductive power transfer system, pp. 1598-1601, (2010); Huh, Jin, Characterization of novel inductive power transfer systems for on-line electric vehicles, Conference Proceedings - IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC, pp. 1975-1979, (2011); Mur-Miranda, José Oscar, Wireless power transfer using weakly coupled magnetostatic resonators, pp. 4179-4186, (2010); Cheon, Sanghoon, Circuit-model-based analysis of a wireless energy-transfer system via coupled magnetic resonances, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 58, 7, pp. 2906-2914, (2011); Imura, Takehiro, Maximizing air gap and efficiency of magnetic resonant coupling for wireless power transfer using equivalent circuit and Neumann formula, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 58, 10, pp. 4746-4752, (2011); Kurs, André, Wireless power transfer via strongly coupled magnetic resonances, Science, 317, 5834, pp. 83-86, (2007); Kang, Min-sig, Sliding mode control for an active magnetic bearing system subject to base motion, Mechatronics, 20, 1, pp. 171-178, (2010)","","International Research Publication House irpeditor@gmail.com","","","","","","09743154","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090337722"

Naturally fractured reservoir plays a crucial role in oil exploration to contribute for hydrocarbon production in Vietnam. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the fractures system in the basement reservoir are challenges for oil and gas production. They require the realistic simulation scenarios to estimate the hydrocarbon potential as well as field development plan of these reservoirs. Thus, this paper aims to propose the feasibility development scenarios to improve oil recovery factor for crystalline basement reservoir, X field, Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam. First, history matching process is validated for the model to fit the actual production data (reservoir pressure, pressure, water cut in each well) in order to approach closer the fluid flow behavior through the reservoir. The manual matching was selected to adjust the actual aquifer size and permeability distribution with limit simulation runs. Next, the highest reliability matching model which approximately reflects the actual fluid flow behavior can be used as the base case to forecast the future reservoir performance through the field development plan. The most potential scenario is to add six new infill production wells, two side track wells and two water injection wells. The forecasted results indicate that this scenario yields 8% more oil recovery factor compared to the natural drive with thirteen producers. This result suggests that the precise field development plan is to increase the efficiency of the production process by increasing the displacement parameters of residual oil and reservoir sweep efficiency by stimulation. The major contribution of this paper demonstrates the merits of the field development plan in fractured basement reservoir. The findings of this study can help better understand the fluid flow behavior using the production history profiles and field development scenarios of crystalline basement reservoir of Cuu Long Basin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crystalline Basement; Cuu Long Basin; Field Development Plan; Production Optimization; Vietnam; Aquifers; Buildings; Crystalline Materials; Digital Storage; Efficiency; Flow Of Fluids; Fracture; Hydrocarbons; Infill Drilling; Injection (oil Wells); Petroleum Prospecting; Petroleum Reservoir Engineering; Petroleum Reservoirs; Crystalline Basement; Cuu Long Basin; Field Development Plans; Production Optimization; Viet Nam; Oil Field Development","Aquifers; Buildings; Crystalline materials; Digital storage; Efficiency; Flow of fluids; Fracture; Hydrocarbons; Infill drilling; Injection (oil wells); Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Crystalline basement; Cuu Long Basin; Field development plans; Production optimization; Viet Nam; Oil field development","","","This research is funded by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology—VNU—HCM under grant number T-ĐCDK-2018-06.","Alfarge, Dheiaa, Numerical simulation study on miscible EOR techniques for improving oil recovery in shale oil reservoirs, Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, 8, 3, pp. 901-916, (2018); Ashraf, Umar, Classification of reservoir facies using well log and 3D seismic attributes for prospect evaluation and field development: A case study of Sawan gas field, Pakistan, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 175, pp. 338-351, (2019); Abdel-Azim, Reda, Integration of static and dynamic reservoir data to optimize the generation of subsurface fracture map, Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, 6, 4, pp. 691-703, (2016); Babadagli, T., Development of mature oil fields - A review, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 57, 3-4, pp. 221-246, (2007); Asia Pacific Conference on Integrated Modelling for Asset Management, (2000); Dachanuwattana, Silpakorn, An efficient MCMC history matching workflow using fit-for-purpose proxies applied in unconventional oil reservoirs, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 176, pp. 381-395, (2019); Dakhelpour-Ghoveifel, Jalal, Capillary-based method for rock typing in transition zone of carbonate reservoirs, Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology, 9, 3, pp. 2009-2018, (2019); Offshore Technology Conference, (2011); Dejam, Morteza, Semi-analytical solution for pressure transient analysis of a hydraulically fractured vertical well in a bounded dual-porosity reservoir, Journal of Hydrology, 565, pp. 289-301, (2018); Giao, P.

Among approaches, mutation is a direct alteration on the genome and considered as one of the most beneficial routes to acquire new beneficial traits in rice. An experiment was carried out to explore the effects of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) mutation on the antioxidant activities, phytochemical compounds, and momilactones A (MA) and B (MB) in rice. Two rice cultivars, K1 (an original cultivar DT84) and K2 (mutated DT84), were examined. Antioxidant activities, phenolic compounds, and momilactones of the rice grain, husk, and straw portions were measured and quantified. Antioxidant activities were higher in grain and straw of K2, whereas K1 showed greater antioxidant activity in rice husk. Additionally, K2 displayed higher total phenolic contents (TPC) in grain and straw as well as lower of it in the husk, but these variations significantly differed only in the straw portion. An increase in total flavonoid contents (TFC) was observed in the husk of K1, while K2 significantly enhanced TFC in straw. Both MA and MB, two compounds obtaining antidiabetes, anticancer, antimicrobial, antigout, and antiobesity properties, were detected and quantified in grain, husk, and straw of K1 and K2 samples. Generally, the contents of MA were higher than MB in all tested portions of rice crop. MA and MB were higher in straw followed by those in husk and grain, respectively. K2 contained higher amounts of MA and MB in straw and husk, but lower contents in grain compared with those in K1. This study illustrates that MNU mutation can improve grain quality and enhance bioactive compounds in straw, husk, and grain of rice. This approach has the potential to develop functional foods from rice, and therefore help farmers in developing countries to improve value in rice production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anticancer; Antidiabetes; Antigout; Antiobesity; Antioxidants; Flavonoids; Mnu Mutation; Momilactone A; Momilactone B; Phenolics; Rice; Crop Improvement; Experimental Study; Mutation; Phenolic Compound; Physicochemical Property; Phytochemistry; Plant Extract; Rice; Secondary Metabolite; Urea","crop improvement; experimental study; mutation; phenolic compound; physicochemical property; phytochemistry; plant extract; rice; secondary metabolite; urea","","","This research did not receive any external funding.

Minor actinides are loaded uniformly in the fuel of the cores, and the MA contents are determined to minimize the burnup reactivity swings. In the S-CO<inf>2</inf>-FR, the burnup reactivity swing is minimized to 0.11% ∆k/kk’ when the MA content is 6.0 wt%. In the SFR, the MA content was determined to reduce the burnup reactivity swing while maintaining sodium void reactivity under a design limitation of 5 $. The burnup reactivity swing of the SFR is reduced to 1.94% ∆k/kk’, whereas sodium void reactivity is about 4.7 $ when 10.0 wt% MAs are loaded. The low burnup reactivity swing enables minimization of control rod operation during fuel burnup. The number of control rods in the two reactors is reduced to ten, which is half of a typical sodium-cooled mixed-oxide fuel MONJU reactor without MA loading. The MA transmutation rates in the S-CO<inf>2</inf>-FR and SFR are 42.2 and 52.2 kg/year, respectively, which are equivalent to the production rates in seven and nine light water reactors of the same electrical output. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fast Reactor; Minor Actinide; Reactivity Swing; Transmutation Rate; Actinides; Carbon Dioxide; Control Rods; Fast Reactors; Light Water Reactors; Nuclear Fuels; Reactor Cores; Sodium Compounds; Burnup Reactivity Swing; Design Limitations; Electrical Output; Minor Actinide; Minor Actinide Transmutation; Production Rates; Sodium Void Reactivity; Supercritical Co2; Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors","Actinides; Carbon dioxide; Control rods; Fast reactors; Light water reactors; Nuclear fuels; Reactor cores; Sodium compounds; Burnup reactivity swing; Design limitations; Electrical output; Minor actinide; Minor actinide transmutation; Production rates; Sodium void reactivity; Supercritical CO2; Sodium-cooled fast reactors","","","This research was supported by National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam, under grant 103.04-2017.20.","Salvatores, Massimo, Nuclear fuel cycle strategies including Partitioning and Transmutation, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 235, 7, pp. 805-816, (2005); Salvatores, Massimo, Physics features comparison of TRU burners: Fusion/Fission Hybrids, Accelerator-Driven Systems and low conversion ratio critical fast reactors, Annals of Nuclear Energy, 36, 11-12, pp. 1653-1662, (2009); Salvatores, Massimo, Nuclear waste transmutation, Applied Radiation and Isotopes, 46, 6-7, pp. 681-687, (1995); Dostál, Václav, High-performance supercritical carbon dioxide cycle for next-generation nuclear reactors, Nuclear Technology, 154, 3, pp. 265-282, (2006); Kato, Yasuyoshi, Medium temperature carbon dioxide gas turbine reactor, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 230, 1-3, pp. 195-207, (2004); Proceedings of Fourth Japan Korea Seminar on Advanced Reactors, (2000); Proceedings of International Congress on Advanced Nuclear Power Plants Icapp, (2002); Dostál, Václav, A supercritical CO2 gas turbine power cycle for next-generation nuclear reactors, International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, Proceedings, ICONE, 2, pp. 567-574, (2002); Tozawa, Katsuhiro, Plant system design of supercritical CO2 direct cycle gas turbine fast reactor, 2006, pp. 569-576, (2006); Mito, Makoto, Fast reactor with indirect cycle system of supercritical CO2 gas turbine plant, 2006, pp. 742-751, (2006)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","00295450","","NUTYB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065235228"

In the traditional method where manual labour and experiences play important roles, early plant disease detection and prevention for field crop are inefficient. This can bring negative effects in stopping the spread of diseases. Applications of image processing techniques and computer vision may provide a solution to these problems. Deep learning is known as one of the most powerful techniques which is able to address more complicated tasks compared to traditional machine learning thanks to the embedded complex layers. This paper presents an image-based diseases identification method using a deep neural network with contrast enhancement and transfer learning from the PlantVillage dataset. Since there exist various sizes of leaf, rescaling and centre alignment are performed to standardize images. Besides, contrast enhancement is used to improve quality of visualization which gives a well-prepared step for further processing. By using a collected mango disease dataset, the proposed model is trained to identify 3 common diseases from the healthy one. The proposed model is then compared with other pre-trained models. An accuracy of 88.46% is achieved for the proposed model, which is higher than the results obtained from other pre-trained models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrast Enhancement; Deep Learning; Disease Identification; Mango Leaf Disease; Residual Neural Network; Agricultural Robots; Crops; Deep Neural Networks; Fruits; Image Enhancement; Learning Systems; Transfer Learning; Common Disease; Contrast Enhancement; Field Crops; Identification Method; Image Processing Technique; Image-based; Plant Disease; Spread Of Disease; Deep Learning","Agricultural robots; Crops; Deep neural networks; Fruits; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Transfer learning; Common disease; Contrast Enhancement; Field crops; Identification method; Image processing technique; Image-based; Plant disease; Spread of disease; Deep learning","","","","Iqbal, Zahid, An automated detection and classification of citrus plant diseases using image processing techniques: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 12-32, (2018); Prasad, Shitala, Multi-resolution mobile vision system for plant leaf disease diagnosis, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 10, 2, pp. 379-388, (2016); Es-saady, Youssef, Automatic recognition of plant leaves diseases based on serial combination of two SVM classifiers, pp. 561-566, (2016); Srunitha, K., Mango leaf unhealthy region detection and classification, Lecture Notes in Computational Vision and Biomechanics, 28, pp. 422-436, (2018); Sethupathy, Jayaprakash, OpenCV based disease identification of mango leaves, International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 8, 5, pp. 1990-1998, (2016); Singh, Vijai, Detection of plant leaf diseases using image segmentation and soft computing techniques, Information Processing in Agriculture, 4, 1, pp. 41-49, (2017); Zhang, Shanwen, Leaf image based cucumber disease recognition using sparse representation classification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 134, pp. 135-141, (2017); Mohanty, Sharada Prasanna, Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, September, (2016); Ferentinos, Konstantinos P., Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 145, pp. 311-318, (2018); Sladojević, Srdjan M., Deep Neural Networks Based Recognition of Plant Diseases by Leaf Image Classification, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2016, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 IEEE Conference on Sustainable Utilization and Development in Engineering and Technologies, CSUDET 2019","","Penang","163824","","9781728132761","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094634072"

Recently, with the advanced technology of smart meters, both active and reactive power outputs of PV inverters are tuned to optimize network operation e.g. minimizing network loss and PVs' active power curtailment in centralized methods. However, searching the optimal output of PVs in a large feasible operational region along with several variables due to the increasing number of PV systems requires a centralized controller much time to converge and cannot efficiently catch up with the change of PVs' output in the real operation. In this paper, by narrowing the searching region, boundary optimal inverter dispatch method is proposed. More reliable simulation outputs are obtained within a shorter calculation time, making the proposed method more applicable in the practical operation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Optimal Power Flow; Photovoltaic (pv) Systems; Power Distribution; Power Quality; Reactive Power Control; Electric Inverters; Electric Load Flow; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Power Quality; Reactive Power; Real Time Systems; Active And Reactive Power; Advanced Technology; Centralized Controllers; Medium-voltage Distribution Systems; Optimal Power Flows; Optimal Power Output; Photovoltaic Systems; Power Distributions; Power Control","Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Power quality; Reactive power; Real time systems; Active and Reactive Power; Advanced technology; Centralized controllers; Medium-voltage distribution systems; Optimal power flows; Optimal power output; Photovoltaic systems; Power distributions; Power control","","","","Canova, Aldo, Electrical impact of photovoltaic plant in distributed network, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 45, 1, pp. 341-347, (2009); Siti, Mukwanga Willy, Reconfiguration and load balancing in the LV and MV distribution networks for optimal performance, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 22, 4, pp. 2534-2540, (2007); Huat, Chua Kein, Energy storage system for mitigating voltage unbalance on low-voltage networks with photovoltaic systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 27, 4, pp. 1783-1790, (2012); Liu, Xiaohu, Coordinated control of distributed energy storage system with tap changer transformers for voltage rise mitigation under high photovoltaic penetration, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 2, pp. 897-906, (2012); Hossain, Mohammed Imran, Investigation of the interaction between step voltage regulators and large-scale photovoltaic systems regarding voltage regulation and unbalance, IET Renewable Power Generation, 10, 3, pp. 299-309, (2016); Farivar, Masoud, Optimal inverter VAR control in distribution systems with high PV penetration, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, (2012); Dall’Anese, Emiliano, Optimal dispatch of photovoltaic inverters in residential distribution systems, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 2, pp. 487-497, (2014); Šulc, Petr, Optimal distributed control of reactive power via the alternating direction method of multipliers, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 29, 4, pp. 968-977, (2014); Demirok, Erhan, Local reactive power control methods for overvoltage prevention of distributed solar inverters in low-voltage grids, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 1, 2, pp. 174-182, (2011); Su, Xiangjing, Optimal PV inverter reactive power control and real power curtailment to improve performance of unbalanced four-wire LV distribution networks, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 3, pp. 967-977, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering (CSEE); IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES)","2019 IEEE Sustainable Power and Energy Conference, iSPEC 2019","","Beijing","157236","","9781728149301","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079509594"

Heavy ion beams consisting of 12C and 16O with E<inf>beam</inf> = 36 MeV were used to investigate the detector performance. By using various beam intensities ranging from 103 to 106 particles per second (pps), the maximum counting rate of the ion counter was measured to be about 8 × 105 pps. The detector performance under different gases was also investigated using two common gases in the ionization chamber: isobutane and P-10 gases. The results show that the negative effects due to pileups, which are often observed at high counting rates, can be greatly reduced when P-10 gas is used. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fast Response Time; Gas-filled Ionization Chamber; Multiple Electrodes; Particle Identification; Tandem Accelerator; Butane; Carbon; Oxygen; Butane; Carbon; Isobutane; Oxygen; Unclassified Drug; Article; Equipment Design; Gas; Heavy Ion Radiation; Japan; Pressure","butane; carbon; isobutane; oxygen; unclassified drug; Article; equipment design; gas; heavy ion radiation; Japan; pressure","","butane, 106-97-8; carbon, 7440-44-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (Nos.

With the direct-coupling configuration, the power loss on an interlink DC/DC converter and its cost are avoided as known. Since the maximum power point (MPP) of PV unit is fluctuated by the fluctuating irradiance, this MPP is tracked by changing the number of the electrolyzer cell controlled by the MPPT algorithm, which allows changing the PV operating voltage. In our system, the averaged PV efficiency is 17.2%, and the electrolysis efficiency is 86.5% in a whole-day test. Thus, the STH efficiency is 14.9%. The hydrogen generation capacity of 18.6 Nm3 (5.01 kg CO<inf>2</inf> reduction) is demonstrated in that whole-day test. Besides, the method to make the simulation model of the system from on-site data is shown. As a result, neither the preliminary test nor off-site test is needed.

They were installed mainly on land. However, on the land, the wind regime change is very complex such as high turbulence and constantly changing wind direction. In the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-1 standard, the wind regime is devided into the normal wind conditions and the extreme wind conditions. This study will focus on the extreme wind direction change and estimate the aerodynamic forces acting on a 3-bladed HAWT under this condition. Because the extreme wind direction change may cause extreme loads and it will affect the lifetime of HAWTs. This issue is experimented in the wind tunnel in Mie University, Japan to understand these effects. The wind turbine model is the 3-bladed HAWT type and using Avistar airfoil for making blades. A 6-component balance is used to measure the forces and the moments acting on the entire wind turbine in the three directions of x, y and z-axes. This study estimates the load fluctuation of the 3-bladed wind turbine under extreme wind direction change. The results show that the yaw moment and the pitch moment under the extreme wind direction change fluctuate larger than the normal wind condition. Specifically, before the sudden wind direction change happened, the averaged maximum pitch moment MX is-1.78 Nm, and after that MX is 4.45 Nm at inrush azimuth of 0°. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3-bladed Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Extreme Wind Direction Change; Load; Wind Tunnel; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; 3-bladed Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Direction Change; Extreme Wind Direction Change; Extreme Winds; Horizontal-axis Wind Turbines; Load; Pitch Moment; Wind Conditions; Wind Directions; Wind Regime; Wind Tunnels","Horizontal axis wind turbine; 3-bladed horizontal axis wind turbine; Direction change; Extreme wind direction change; Extreme winds; Horizontal-axis wind turbines; Load; Pitch moment; Wind conditions; Wind directions; Wind regime; Wind tunnels","","","This experiment was performed in Mie University-Fluid Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment in Japan.

However, this issue has not been paid much attention in Vietnam, even though SMEs account for about 95% of total enterprises and the financial market of the country has not been well developed. This study investigates the causal effects of access to finance on productivity of SMEs operating in the manufacturing sector in Vietnam. Productivity was measured as the total factor productivity (TFP) obtained by production function estimation using the Levinsohn and Petrin approach. Regarding financial accessibility, two factors covered the extent to which firms might have a bank loan or overdraft facility were employed. To study the causal inferences of access to finance on firm productivity, the research adopted the difference-in-differences (DID) approach, as well as the propensity score matching (PSM) coupled with DID technique. The empirical results indicated that improving the financial accessibility could directly enhance firm productivity. Particularly, it was shown that firms having access to a bank loan could significantly improve TFP by approximately 8.6% in the DID model and about 9% in the PSM-DID model. Meanwhile, the firm average TFP increased by approximately 12.3% and 15.7% in simple DID and PSM-DID models, respectively, when firms had an overdraft facility. These findings suggest that the government should put more effort into assisting SMEs in generating bankable projects, and create a sound and healthy financial environment to stimulate firms' access to finance, which will ensure their sustainability and growth. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access To Finance; Difference-in-differences; Propensity Score Matching; Total Factor Productivity; Vietnamese Small And Medium Enterprises; Financial Market; Financial Services; Industrial Production; Manufacturing; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; State Role; Sustainability; Total Factor Productivity; Viet Nam","financial market; financial services; industrial production; manufacturing; small and medium-sized enterprise; state role; sustainability; total factor productivity; Viet Nam","","","","Finance for all Policies and Pitfalls in Expanding Access, (2008); Hallward-Driemeier, Mary, Ownership, investment climate and firm performance: Evidence from Chinese firms, Economics of Transition, 14, 4, pp. 629-647, (2006); Sleuwaegen, Leo, Growth of firms in developing countries, evidence from Côte d'Ivoire, Journal of Development Economics, 68, 1, pp. 117-135, (2002); Ayyagari, Meghana, How important are financing constraints?

The advantage of using BPPs is that the thermal conductivity of BPP-dispersed fuel pin could be improved. Numerical calculations have been conducted for optimizing the BPP parameters using the MVP code and the JENDL-3.3 data library. The results show that by using Gd<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles with the diameter of 60 μm and the packing fraction of 5%, the burnup reactivity curve and pin-wise power distribution are obtained approximately that of the reference design. To minimize power peaking factor (PPF), total BP amount has been distributed in a larger number of fuel rods. Optimization has been conducted for the number of BPP-dispersed rods, their distribution, BPP diameter and packing fraction. Two models of assembly consisting of 18 BPP-dispersed rods have been selected. The diameter of 300 μm and the packing fraction of 3.33% were determined so that the burnup reactivity curve is approximate that of the reference one, while the PPF can be decreased from 1.167 to 1.105 and 1.113, respectively.

To deal with the overvoltage, inverter-based reactive power contribution is one of the most commonly proposed approaches. However, using standard strategies with fixed droop parameters limits the control effectiveness. Moreover, much reactive power absorbed by PVs around noon might increase the network loss, overload the substation consequently, especially in the network with long distribution feeders. In this paper, a combined centralized and local control method is proposed with the suggestion of multilayer structure. Droop parameters of local control are updated every 15 min by centralized control to minimize reactive power flow through substation while keeping voltages in permitted levels. By avoiding overloading substation, more PV generation can be added to the feeder. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Droop Control; Particle Swarm Optimization; Photovoltaic (pv) Systems; Reactive Power Control; Voltage Control; Electric Load Flow; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Particle Swarm Optimization (pso); Photovoltaic Cells; Reactive Power; Smart Power Grids; Solar Power Generation; Voltage Control; Centralized Control; Control Effectiveness; Distribution Feeders; Droop Control; Multilayer Structures; Mv Distribution Networks; Photovoltaic Systems; Solar Photovoltaic System; Power Control","Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Reactive power; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Voltage control; Centralized control; Control effectiveness; Distribution feeders; Droop control; Multilayer structures; MV distribution networks; Photovoltaic systems; Solar photovoltaic system; Power control","","","","Canova, Aldo, Electrical impact of photovoltaic plant in distributed network, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 45, 1, pp. 341-347, (2009); Tonkoski, Reinaldo, Impact of high PV penetration on voltage profiles in residential neighborhoods, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 3, 3, pp. 518-527, (2012); Samadi, Afshin, Coordinated active power-dependent voltage regulation in distribution grids with PV systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 29, 3, pp. 1454-1464, (2014); Demirok, Erhan, Local reactive power control methods for overvoltage prevention of distributed solar inverters in low-voltage grids, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 1, 2, pp. 174-182, (2011); Tonkoski, Reinaldo, Coordinated active power curtailment of grid connected PV inverters for overvoltage prevention, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 2, 2, pp. 139-147, (2011); Chistyakov, Yury S., Combined central and local control of reactive power in electrical grids with distributed generation, pp. 325-330, (2012); Meyer, Marian, Optimal use of decentralized methods for volt/var control in distribution networks, (2017); Demirok, Erhan, Evaluation of the voltage support strategies for the low voltage grid connected PV generators, pp. 710-717, (2010); Park, Jong-bae, An improved particle swarm optimization for nonconvex economic dispatch problems, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 25, 1, pp. 156-166, (2010); Solar Energy, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe, ISGT-Europe 2019","","Bucharest; University Politehnica of Bucharest","154913","","9781538682180","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075862120"

Especially in a fast-changing world where knowledge about nature and society is in a constant state of flux, book reading helps students foster skills such as thinking, valuing, adaptability and creativity for sustainable development. This research study used a dataset of 1676 observations of junior high school students from Northern Vietnam to explore students' academic achievement and its association with their reading passion, family socio economic condition, parental education and occupational aspiration. The empirical results show that higher grades in STEM-related subjects are predicted by reading interest (β<inf>Readbook</inf> = 0.425, p < 0.0001), with students who love reading books achieve higher score than those who take no interest in books. Remarkably, the education level of the mother strongly enhances academic performance, with β = 0.721 (p < 0.0001) in cases of mother having a university diploma or higher. Students coming from wealthy families are more likely to buy books whereas borrowing from the library is the main source of books for students who grow up in not-rich families. However, even among wealthy families, investment into buying books still rely more on personal interest, despite the aforementioned educational benefits of book reading, as evidenced by an over 7 percentage point disparity between the likelihood of purchasing books among wealthy-family students who took an interest in reading (45%) versus students of the same background who did not like to read (38.7%).

The initial investigation found that the NiO and B<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles were dispersed on the outer surface of the high surface area SBA-15 support. In addition, the catalytic activity was increased linearly with the tested reaction temperature due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. In fact, the catalyst achieved the CH<inf>4</inf> conversion and H<inf>2</inf>/CO molar ratio of approximately 67.3% and 2.7, respectively at 1073 K. The resulting product ratio is highly suitable for downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The B-promoted catalyst showed the lowest degree of catalyst deactivation (4%) at 1023 K. Additionally, the XPS measurements unveiled that the boron facilitates the adsorption of CO<inf>2</inf> by donating electrons to the neighbouring Ni cluster and thus improved its catalytic performance. Furthermore, Raman and XRD analysis revealed that the boron promotion on 10%Ni/SBA-15 could prevent the reoxidation and deposition of carbonaceous species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boron Promoter; Mesoporous Sio2; Methane Bi-reforming; Ni/sba-15; Syngas; Boron; Catalyst Deactivation; Fischer-tropsch Synthesis; Methane; Molar Ratio; Nickel Metallography; Nickel Oxide; Silica; Carbonaceous Species; Catalytic Performance; Incipientwetness Impregnation; Mesoporous; Ni/sba-15; Ni/sba-15 Catalysts; Reaction Temperature; Syn-gas; Catalyst Activity","Boron; Catalyst deactivation; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Methane; Molar ratio; Nickel metallography; Nickel oxide; Silica; Carbonaceous species; Catalytic performance; Incipientwetness impregnation; Mesoporous; Ni/SBA-15; Ni/SBA-15 catalysts; Reaction temperature; Syn-gas; Catalyst activity","","","The authors are greatly thankful to the financial aid, UMP Research Grant Scheme ( RDU170326 ) supported by Universiti Malaysia Pahang for carrying out the research.","Figueroa, José D., Advances in CO2 capture technology-The U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 2, 1, pp. 9-20, (2008); Park, Daeil, Effects of polyvinyl-pyrrolidone in a polyol method on preparation of a perovskite-type catalyst for steam-CO2 reforming of methane, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 40, 3, pp. 1481-1489, (2015); Wang, Wei, Recent advances in catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, Chemical Society Reviews, 40, 7, pp. 3703-3727, (2011); Vo, Dai Viet N., A potassium-promoted Mo carbide catalyst system for hydrocarbon synthesis, Catalysis Science and Technology, 2, 10, pp. 2066-2076, (2012); Jabbour, Karam, Ordered mesoporous “one-pot” synthesized Ni-Mg(Ca)-Al2O3 as effective and remarkably stable catalysts for combined steam and dry reforming of methane (CSDRM), Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 201, pp. 527-542, (2017); Abdullah, Bawadi Bin, Recent advances in dry reforming of methane over Ni-based catalysts, Journal of Cleaner Production, 162, pp. 170-185, (2017); Roh, Hyun-seog, Combined reforming of methane over supported Ni catalysts, Catalysis Letters, 117, 1-2, pp. 85-90, (2007); Koo, Kee Young, Combined H 2O and CO 2 reforming of CH 4 over Ce-promoted Ni/Al 2O 3 catalyst for gas to liquid (GTL) process: Enhancement of Ni-CeO 2 interaction, Catalysis Today, 185, 1, pp. 126-130, (2012); Huang, Fei, Catalytic performances of Ni/mesoporous SiO2 catalysts for dry reforming of methane to hydrogen, Journal of Energy Chemistry, 25, 4, pp. 709-719, (2016); Al-Fatesh, Ahmed Sadeq A., CO2-reforming of methane to produce syngas over Co-Ni/SBA-15 catalyst: Effect of support modifiers (Mg, la and Sc) on catalytic stability, Journal of CO2 Utilization, 21, pp. 395-404, (2017)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03603199","0080311393","IJHED","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049724013"

Despite the fact that various models have been developed, few of them address the short-term popularity prediction. Toward this goal, we exploit the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer, a state-of-the-art model in neural machine translation, to forecast the values of multiple time series in the near future. Specifically, we propose an attention-based non-recursive neural network, a novel model that entirely dispenses with recurrence and convolutions, for time series prediction. Since our model is the combination of the input attention mechanism in the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) and the self-attention of Transformer, it is able to adaptively select the most relevant input sequences as well as capture the long-term dependencies across previous time steps to make the prediction. The experiments show the root mean square errors (RMSEs) achieved by our model are only 6.06 and 3.60 when testing on the NASDAQ 100 dataset and the views count of the top most popular videos on Youtube respectively, while the RMSEs of DA-RNN are 8.52 and 12.31. Hence, our model outperforms the baseline not only in time series prediction but also in contents popularity prediction aspect. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Time Series Prediction; Transformer; Youtube Video; Data Communication Systems; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Mean Square Error; Smart City; Statistical Tests; Time Series; Long-term Dependencies; Machine Translations; Popularity Predictions; Recursive Neural Networks; Root Mean Square Errors; Time Series Prediction; Transformer; Youtube; Recurrent Neural Networks","Data communication systems; Deep learning; Forecasting; Mean square error; Smart city; Statistical tests; Time series; Long-term dependencies; Machine translations; Popularity predictions; Recursive neural networks; Root mean square errors; Time series prediction; Transformer; YouTube; Recurrent neural networks","","","This research was conducted within the project Optimizing Color-Based Cooperative Caching Algorithm for Telco-CDNs sponsored by TIS Inc.

However, in a developing country like Vietnam, statistics have reported a low figure in book reading: only 1.2 books a year. This research study used a dataset of 1676 observations of junior high school students from Northern Vietnam to explore students' reading behavior and its association with demographic factors, and the family's reading culture. Data analysis suggests the older the student gets, the less inclined they are to read, and being female and having hobbies of low sensory stimulation are linked to higher preference for reading. Regarding scholarly culture at home, students who read more varied types of books and spend more time on books are correlated with higher reading interest. Reading habits are also positively reinforced by the capacity to access books and parental book reading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Education For Sustainable Developments; Gender; Junior High School Students; Reading Abilities; Reading Practices; Sustainable Education; Vietnam; Culture; Data Interpretation; Data Set; Developing World; Education; Gender; Sexuality; Student; Sustainable Development; Textbook; Viet Nam","culture; data interpretation; data set; developing world; education; gender; sexuality; student; sustainable development; textbook; Viet Nam","","","","Quality Education; Ritchie, Stuart J., Does Learning to Read Improve Intelligence?

TCP/NC uses additional sub-layer called Network Coding layer below the TCP layer to handle packet losses without sensed by the TCP layer. In our previous work, we introduced some variants of TCP/NC such as TCP/NCwLRLBE (TCP/NC with Loss Rate and Loss Burstiness Estimation) which can improve the retransmission and adapt to the changing of the channel. However, it is just evaluated on the simple packet loss conditions, e.g., random loss or Gilbert loss. On the other hand, reliable end-To-end data transfer in diverse IoT (Internet of Things) environments (e.g., Power Line Communication-PLC) in a cost-efficient manner is an emerging challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the characteristics of the TCP/NC on PLC networks, to have a more in-depth evaluation of its performance and applicability in a practical PLC environment with many conditions causing packet loss such as noise variants, distance, etc. The result of our simulation on ns-3 (Network Simulation 3) shows that TCP/NC can work well on PLC environment compared to the traditional protocols such as TCP NewReno with Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) and TCP Westwood+. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Iot; Network Coding; Packet Loss; Plc; Tcp/nc; Carrier Transmission On Power Lines; Codes (symbols); Data Transfer; Internet Of Things; Network Layers; Packet Loss; Petroleum Reservoir Evaluation; Programmable Logic Controllers; Transmission Control Protocol; Depth Evaluations; Network Simulation; Performance Characteristics; Power Line Communication Networks; Power Line Communications; Retransmission Control; Tcp/nc; Transmission Performance; Network Coding","Carrier transmission on power lines; Codes (symbols); Data transfer; Internet of things; Network layers; Packet loss; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Programmable logic controllers; Transmission control protocol; Depth evaluations; Network simulation; Performance characteristics; Power line communication networks; Power line communications; Retransmission control; TCP/NC; Transmission performance; Network coding","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2018-18-24.","Fu, Chengpeng, TCP Veno: TCP enhancement for transmission over wireless access networks, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 21, 2, pp. 216-228, (2003); Mascolo, Saverio, TCP Westwood: Bandwidth estimation for enhanced transport over wireless links, Proceedings of the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MOBICOM, pp. 287-297, (2001); Tsiknas, Konstantinos G., Comparative performance evaluation of TCP variants in WiMAX (and WLANs) network configurations, Journal of Computer Networks and Communications, (2012); Caini, Carlo, Comparative performance evaluation of TCP variants on satellite environments, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, (2009); Sundararajan, Jay Kumar, Network coding meets TCP: Theory and implementation, Proceedings of the IEEE, 99, 3, pp. 490-512, (2011); Ha, Nguyen Viet, TCP network coding with enhanced retransmission for heavy and bursty loss, IEICE Transactions on Communications, E100B, 2, pp. 293-303, (2017); Proc 6th Conf on Sys and Net Commun, (2011); Chan, Yicheng, Adaptive network coding scheme for TCP over wireless sensor networks, International Journal of Computers, Communications and Control, 8, 6, pp. 800-811, (2013); van Vu, Thuong, Dynamic coding for TCP transmission reliability in multi-hop wireless networks, (2014); Ha, Nguyen Viet, TCP network coding with adapting parameters for bursty and time-varying loss, IEICE Transactions on Communications, E101B, 2, pp. 476-488, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 International Conference on System Science and Engineering, ICSSE 2019","","Dong Hoi City, Quang Binh Province","151782","","9781728105253","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072928408"

The analytical results confirm the closed linkage between TQM, JIT production practices and flexibility performance. Moreover, this study indicates that the effect of JIT production practices on flexibility performance can be strengthened with a higher level of TQM practices.

A light extinction method is adopted to determine the total soot volume (TSV) as a function of flame height and fuel mass consumption rate (FMCR). The empirical models have been built to predict TSVs of dodecane/propylbenzene (Do/PB) mixtures and aviation bio-paraffins/propylbenzene (Bio-P/PB) mixtures as the function of two variables of FMCR and concentration of propylbenzene content (%PB). TSVs of Do/PB mixtures and Bio-P/PB mixtures increase with increasing flame height, FMCR and %PB. The effect of flame height, FMCR and %PB on soot formation are respectively expressed as the quadratic, power law and linear functions. At low FMCRs, Bio-P/PB mixtures produce a slightly higher TSV than Do/PB mixtures. In contrast, at high FMCRs, the soot formations of Do/PB mixtures are slightly higher than those of their corresponding counterparts. The differences are argued to be mainly due to the remainder of a small amount of oxygenates in the bio-paraffins. It may be concluded that the aviation bio-paraffins are very similar to dodecane in respect to soot formation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aviation Bio-paraffins; Diffusion Wick-fed Flame; Dodecane; Propylbenzene; Soot Formation; Diffusion; Light Extinction; Mixtures; Paraffins; Smoke; Soot; Diffusion Flame; Dodecane; Empirical Model; Extinction Methods; Laminar Diffusion; Linear Functions; Propylbenzene; Soot Formations; Dust; Biofilm; Chemical Compound; Concentration (composition); Diffusion; Extinction; Power Law; Smoke; Soot","Diffusion; Light extinction; Mixtures; Paraffins; Smoke; Soot; Diffusion Flame; Dodecane; Empirical model; Extinction methods; Laminar diffusion; Linear functions; Propylbenzene; Soot formations; Dust; biofilm; chemical compound; concentration (composition); diffusion; extinction; power law; smoke; soot","","","The operation funds for this work have been provided by Japan International Cooperation Agency ( JICA ) under the project of ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net).

Experimental results confirm that current stress is reduced 40% compared to that of cold-starting method; and the starting time is shorten by 12.5% compared to that obtained by DPS method with the same current stress. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Current Stress; Dual-active-bridge Converter; Inrush Current; Phase Shift; Soft-starting; Microgrids; Current Stress; Dual Active Bridge Converter; Dual Active Bridges; Mathematics Equations; Soft Starting; Soft-starting Techniques; Starting Methods; Starting Time; Dc-dc Converters","Microgrids; Current stress; Dual active bridge converter; Dual active bridges; Mathematics equations; Soft starting; Soft-starting techniques; Starting methods; Starting time; DC-DC converters","","","","Cho, Yong-won, High-Efficiency Bidirectional DAB Inverter Using a Novel Hybrid Modulation for Stand-Alone Power Generating System with Low Input Voltage, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 31, 6, pp. 4138-4147, (2016); Xue, Lingxiao Lincoln, Dual Active Bridge-Based Battery Charger for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle with Charging Current Containing Low Frequency Ripple, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 30, 12, pp. 7299-7307, (2015); Shi, Yuxiang, High-frequency-link-based grid-tied PV system with small DC-link capacitor and low-frequency ripple-free maximum power point tracking, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 31, 1, pp. 328-339, (2016); Choi, Wooin, Fundamental Duty Modulation of Dual-Active-Bridge Converter for Wide-Range Operation, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 31, 6, pp. 4048-4064, (2016); Oggier, Germán Gustavo, Modulation strategy to operate the dual active bridge DCDC converter under soft switching in the whole operating range, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 26, 4, pp. 1228-1236, (2011); Bai, Hua Kevin, Eliminate reactive power and increase system efficiency of isolated bidirectional dual-active-bridge dc-dc converters using novel dual-phase-shift control, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 23, 6, pp. 2905-2914, (2008); Nguyen, Duy Dinh, Reduced-Order Observer-Based Control System for Dual-Active-Bridge DC/DC Converter, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 54, 4, pp. 3426-3439, (2018); Zhou, Haihua, Interleaved bi-directional Dual Active Bridge DC-DC converter for interfacing ultracapacitor in micro-grid application, IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, pp. 2229-2234, (2010); Zhao, Biao, Current-stress-optimized switching strategy of isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter with dual-phase-shift control, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 60, 10, pp. 4458-4467, (2013); Zhao, Biao, Efficiency characterization and optimization of isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter based on dual-phase-shift control for DC distribution application, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 4, pp. 1711-1727, (2013)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd IEEE International Conference on DC Microgrids, ICDCM 2019","","Matsue","165297","","9781728134918","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098207414"

Surface observation and X-ray diffraction measurement showed that Gd2O3 doping into CeO2 depressed the grain size of CeO2-Gd2O3 solid solution and caused the expansion of the lattice parameter up to 15 wt% of Gd2O3 content. The mechanical properties were estimated from the sound velocities measured by the ultrasonic pulse-echo method. The sound velocities in CeO2-Gd2O3 were found to decrease with increasing Gd2O3 content, which caused the reduction in the elastic moduli and Debye temperature. On the other hand, the results obtained from MD analyses showed the lattice expansion of CeO2-Gd2O3, the decrease of the average nearest distance between Ce (or Gd) and O ions, and the decrease of oxygen coordination number around each cation while the Gd2O3 content was increasing. It was, therefore, found that the bond valence sum considered to be the effective cation charge slightly decreased with increasing Gd2O3 content. Thus, the crystal binding energy decreased and consequently, the elastic moduli decreased. In addition, the lower value of experimental elastic moduli may be partly caused by crystal imperfection, e.g. grain boundaries, pores, and cracks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Burnable Poison; Ceo2; Debye Temperature; Elastic Moduli; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Sound Velocity; Uo2; Acoustic Wave Velocity; Binding Energy; Cerium Oxide; Debye Temperature; Elastic Moduli; Grain Boundaries; Molecular Dynamics; Nuclear Energy; Nuclear Fuels; Positive Ions; Solid Solutions; Uranium Dioxide; Burnable Poisons; Ceo2; Crystal Imperfections; Molecular Dynamics Simulations; Oxygen Coordination Number; Surface Observation; Ultrasonic Pulse-echo Method; X-ray Diffraction Measurements; Gadolinium Compounds","Acoustic wave velocity; Binding energy; Cerium oxide; Debye temperature; Elastic moduli; Grain boundaries; Molecular dynamics; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Positive ions; Solid solutions; Uranium dioxide; Burnable poisons; CeO2; Crystal imperfections; Molecular dynamics simulations; Oxygen coordination number; Surface observation; Ultrasonic pulse-echo method; X-ray diffraction measurements; Gadolinium compounds","","","","Shimamura, Keiichi, Thermophysical properties of rare-earth-stabilized zirconia and zirconate pyrochlores as surrogates for actinide-doped zirconia, International Journal of Thermophysics, 28, 3, pp. 1074-1084, (2007); Inaba, Hideaki, Molecular dynamics simulation of gadolinia-doped ceria, Solid State Ionics, 122, 1-4, pp. 95-103, (1999); Hirooka, Shun, Sound speeds in and mechanical properties of (U,Pu)O2−x, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 55, 3, pp. 356-362, (2018); Yamada, Kazuhiro, Study of the thermodynamic properties of (U, Ce)O2, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 247, pp. 289-292, (1997); Grover, Vinita, Phase relations, lattice thermal expansion in CeO2-Gd 2O3 system, and stabilization of cubic gadolinia, Materials Research Bulletin, 39, 6, pp. 859-866, (2004); Venkata Krishnan, Raghavendran, Heat capacity measurements on uranium-cerium mixed oxides by differential scanning calorimetry, Thermochimica Acta, 440, 2, pp. 141-145, (2006); Huang, Keqin, Synthesis and electrical properties of dense Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 ceramics, Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 81, 2, pp. 357-362, (1998); Kossoy, Anna Eden, Evolution of the local structure at the phase transition in CeO 2-Gd2O3 solid solutions, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 87, 5, (2013); Brown, Ian David, Recent developments in the methods and applications of the bond valence model, Chemical Reviews, 109, 12, pp. 6858-6919, (2009); Brese, Nathaniel E., Bond‐valence parameters for solids, Acta Crystallographica Section B: Structural Science, 47, 2, pp. 192-197, (1991)","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) infocentral@asme.org","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME); Chinese Nuclear Society (CNS); et al.; Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers (JSME); Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; Nuclear Power Insttute of China (NPIC)","27th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering: Nuclear Power Saves the World!, ICONE 2019","","Tsukuba, Ibaraki; Tsukuba International Congress Center","150404","","9784888982566; 9784888983051","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071392329"

However, in future power systems, the installed capacities of renewable energy sources such as wind power and photovoltaic generation (PV) systems will increase, and these sources will supply a large volume of electricity. The potentially frequent occurrence of supply-demand imbalances in future power systems is a concern. Therefore, coordinated operation with supply-demand balancing between large power sources and renewable energy sources is necessary. In this study, we focus on operation with supply-demand balancing and PV generation, considering both economic efficiency and reliability. We evaluate the impact of import fuel price transitions on supply and demand in a future power system (for the assumed period of 2030-2050) in which a large PV generation source is installed. We conducted numerical simulations on a bulk power system model.

In a comparison between the original and modified WFFIs, the modified WFFI (70–96%) exhibited better accuracy than the original WFFI (30–70%). Overall, the temporal change in the flood inundation area presented a decreasing trend, and a link to the in-situ observed water level showed a decreasing trend during the rainy season. Furthermore, the estimated flood inundation exhibited a significant delay since 2008. Based on the yearly land cover MODIS product, the permanent water body and wetland areas decreased, whereas the cropland areas increased. This was as a result of increased agricultural productivity. However, water shortage was the major obstacle to increasing agricultural productivity, and it also had a negative impact on aquatic ecology, such as fish spawning grounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Monitoring; Flooding; Natural Disaster; Satellite Remote Sensing","","","","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by the Hiroshima Earth Environment Information Center for the paper submission and the Japanese Grant Aid for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for financial support to the first author (N.V.) for the field survey in Cambodia.

We use a dynamical downscaling method with a regional climate model coupled with an urban canopy scheme to run sensitivity simulations with LUC and AH data from 1990, 2010, and 2030. The LUC data in 1990 and 2010 are derived from remote sensing data, whereas the LUC data for 2030 come from the city's master plan. The AH data are estimated from past and projected energy-use conditions. The results show that the LUC-AH coupled changes during 2010–2030 will have much greater impact on the local UHI effect than those during 1990–2010. In the urban-core area, the monthly mean surface air temperature in July is predicted to increase by 0.7 °C by 2030, double the increase of 0.35 °C during 1990–2010. We show that the temperature increase during 1990–2010 is mostly due to the change in LUC conditions, but the increase in the future AH will contribute 30–50% to the total temperature increase in the urban areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Future Master Plan; Hanoi; Urban Heat Island; Urbanization; Wrf Model; Atmospheric Temperature; Land Use; Landforms; Remote Sensing; Thermal Pollution; Hanoi; Master Plan; Urban Heat Island; Urbanization; Wrf Model; Climate Models","Atmospheric temperature; Land use; Landforms; Remote sensing; Thermal pollution; Hanoi; Master plan; Urban heat island; Urbanization; WRF Model; Climate models","","","Numerical simulations of the present work were conducted under the Interdisciplinary Computational Science Program at the Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba.

The positive relationship between the price of natural gas and crude oil is found to be more prominent in expansions, especially in the long run.

The use of a cascade model suggests a progressive pattern, starting from emotion perception, followed by emotional understanding and emotion regulation, with downstream effects on job performance. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of both measurements, we employed the performance-based ability measurement, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and the self-reporting ability EI measurement, Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS). Our findings supported the cascade model, but in the case of WLEIS measures, both self-emotion appraisal and others' emotion appraisal precede emotion regulation, leading to a positive effect on job performance. Moreover, CI moderated the relationship between EI and job performance, such that a decline in CI rendered the relationship more positive. The MSCEIT and WLEIS showed similar results, thus supporting the cascading model and moderating effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cascading Model; Cognitive Intelligence; Compensatory Model; Emotional Intelligence; Emotional Intelligence Measurement; Artificial Intelligence; Cognition; Job Search; Measurement Method; Numerical Model; Perception; Performance Assessment; Psychology","artificial intelligence; cognition; job search; measurement method; numerical model; perception; performance assessment; psychology","","","","Farh, Crystal I.Chien, Emotional Intelligence, Teamwork Effectiveness, and Job Performance: The Moderating Role of Job Context, Journal of Applied Psychology, 97, 4, pp. 890-900, (2012); Sy, Thomas, Relation of employee and manager emotional intelligence to job satisfaction and performance, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 68, 3, pp. 461-473, (2006); Wong, Chi Sum, The effects of leader and follower emotional intelligence on performance and attitude: An exploratory study, Leadership Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 243-274, (2002); International Journal of Business and Management, (2016); Day, Arla L., Using an ability-based measure of emotional intelligence to predict individual performance, group performance, and group citizenship behaviours, Personality and Individual Differences, 36, 6, pp. 1443-1458, (2004); Kluemper, Donald H., Emotion Management Ability: Predicting Task Performance, Citizenship, and Deviance, Journal of Management, 39, 4, pp. 878-905, (2013); Joseph, Dana L., Emotional Intelligence: An Integrative Meta-Analysis and Cascading Model, Journal of Applied Psychology, 95, 1, pp. 54-78, (2010); Cǒté, Stéphane, Emotional intelligence, cognitive intelligence, and job performance, Administrative Science Quarterly, 51, 1, pp. 1-28, (2006); Palmer, Benjamin R., A psychometric evaluation of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test Version 2.0, Intelligence, 33, 3, pp. 285-305, (2005); Rossen, Eric A., Confirmatory factor analysis of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test V 2.0 (MSCEIT), Personality and Individual Differences, 44, 5, pp. 1258-1269, (2008)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066847398"

However, the mainstream consideration following Berry's model on acculturation does not take into account whether students of the host countries are immune to these problems. This study aims to examine the prevalence and predictors of help-seeking behaviors among international and domestic students in a multicultural environment by employing ANOVA and polynomial regression. Some significant results from this study are: (1) Informal sources were the most prevalent sources of help-seeking among international and domestic students, while formal help-seeking was not popular; (2) international students were more likely to overcome emotional difficulties alone and seek help on the Internet than domestic students; (3) acculturative stress was a positive predictor of formal, informal, and miscellaneous help-seeking behaviors among international students and informal help-seeking behaviors or among domestic students; and (4) depression was negatively correlated with the willingness of international students to seek help from informal sources.

The by-products, including waste paper sludge ash (PSA), fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF), and metakaolin (MK) of different proportions (5%, 10%, 15%) in RAC, were used in two methods: replacement and addition methods. The use of by-products (mineral admixtures) to mitigate the low quality of RAC was demonstrated through experimental outcomes in this study. The addition of industrial by-products was presented as a promising alternative for the addition of more Portland cement in RAC to enhance RAC's quality. The results showed that the strength and durability of RAC containing mineral admixtures in the addition method were higher than the addition of more cement or the replacement method. Notably, PSA considerably improved the mechanical properties of RAC at an early age, and it substantially improved the resistance of RAC to acid and sulfate attacks. At 90 days, FA and MK improved mechanical properties of RAC greater than SF and PSA did. Among combinations, the proportions of by-products in RAC of 5% PSA, 10% SF, 15% MK and 15% FA can produce the highest performance of RAC with 100% coarse recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fly Ash; Metakaolin; Mineral Admixtures; Recycled Aggregate Concrete; Silica Fume; Waste Paper Sludge Ash; Concrete Additives; Concrete Products; Durability; Fly Ash; Minerals; Portland Cement; Recycling; Silica Fume; Sulfur Compounds; Waste Paper; Coarse Recycled Concrete Aggregate; Different Proportions; Industrial By-products; Metakaolins; Mineral Admixtures; Paper Sludge Ash; Recycled Aggregate Concrete; Replacement Methods; Mechanical Properties; Concrete; Fly Ash; Portland Cement","Concrete additives; Concrete products; Durability; Fly ash; Minerals; Portland cement; Recycling; Silica fume; Sulfur compounds; Waste paper; Coarse recycled concrete aggregate; Different proportions; Industrial by-products; Metakaolins; Mineral admixtures; Paper sludge ash; Recycled aggregate concrete; Replacement methods; Mechanical properties; Concrete; Fly Ash; Portland Cement","","","","Abd Elhakam, Ali, Influence of self-healing, mixing method and adding silica fume on mechanical properties of recycled aggregates concrete, Construction and Building Materials, 35, pp. 421-427, (2012); Acharya, Prasanna Kumar, Acid resistance, sulphate resistance and strength properties of concrete containing ferrochrome ash (FA) and lime, Construction and Building Materials, 120, pp. 241-250, (2016); Akhtar, Ali, Construction and demolition waste generation and properties of recycled aggregate concrete: A global perspective, Journal of Cleaner Production, 186, pp. 262-281, (2018); Alnahhal, Mohammed Fouad, Effect of aggressive chemicals on durability and microstructure properties of concrete containing crushed new concrete aggregate and non-traditional supplementary cementitious materials, Construction and Building Materials, 163, pp. 482-495, (2018); Bai, J., Compressive strength and hydration of wastepaper sludge ash-ground granulated blastfurnace slag blended pastes, Cement and Concrete Research, 33, 8, pp. 1189-1202, (2003); Behnood, Ali, Methods for measuring pH in concrete: A review, Construction and Building Materials, 105, pp. 176-188, (2016); Gonzalez-Fonteboa, Belen, Stress-strain relationship in axial compression for concrete using recycled saturated coarse aggregate, Construction and Building Materials, 25, 5, pp. 2335-2342, (2011); Berndt, Marita Louise Allan, Properties of sustainable concrete containing fly ash, slag and recycled concrete aggregate, Construction and Building Materials, 23, 7, pp. 2606-2613, (2009); Brand, Alexander S., Initial moisture and mixing effects on higher quality recycled coarse aggregate concrete, Construction and Building Materials, 79, pp. 83-89, (2015); Bravo, Miguel, Superplasticizer's efficiency on the mechanical properties of recycled aggregates concrete: Influence of recycled aggregates composition and incorporation ratio, Construction and Building Materials, 153, pp. 129-138, (2017)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060065300"

A country's choice of energy resources depends on the balancing of economic growth and environmental degradation, which will be closely related to its development stage. This study examines how the relationship between renewable energy consumption and carbon emissions is associated with the development stage by applying a panel cointegration analysis to 107 countries during the period from 1990 to 2013. The analysis shows the clear differences between the groups of low- and high-income countries. For low-income countries, renewable energy consumption is positively and negatively associated with carbon emissions and output, respectively. However, for high-income countries, renewable energy consumption is negatively and positively associated with carbon emissions and output, respectively. These results have important implications for policymakers, since the discrepancies in these relationships mean that a country's renewable energy policies should be highly compatible with its development stage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Emissions; Panel Cointegration Analysis; Renewable Energy Consumption; Carbon; Climate Change; Economic Analysis; Energy Resources; Carbon Emissions; Development Stages; Economic Growths; Kyoto Protocol; Low Income Countries; Panel Cointegration Analysis; Renewable Energy Consumption; Renewable Energy Policy; Energy Utilization; Alternative Energy; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Cointegration Analysis; Economic Growth; Energy Resource; Environmental Degradation; Environmental Economics; Kyoto Protocol; Policy Making","Carbon; Climate change; Economic analysis; Energy resources; Carbon emissions; Development stages; Economic growths; KYOTO protocol; Low income countries; Panel cointegration analysis; Renewable energy consumption; Renewable energy policy; Energy utilization; alternative energy; carbon emission; climate change; cointegration analysis; economic growth; energy resource; environmental degradation; environmental economics; Kyoto Protocol; policy making","","","","Bhattacharya, Mita, The effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth: Evidence from top 38 countries, Applied Energy, 162, pp. 733-741, (2016); Chen, Weiming, Renewable energy in eastern Asia: Renewable energy policy review and comparative SWOT analysis for promoting renewable energy in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, Energy Policy, 74, C, pp. 319-329, (2014); Chien, Taichen, Renewable energy: An efficient mechanism to improve GDP, Energy Policy, 36, 8, pp. 3035-3042, (2008); Lund, Peter D., Effectiveness of policy measures in transforming the energy system, Energy Policy, 35, 1, pp. 627-639, (2007); Marques, António Cardoso, A Quantile Approach to Identify Factors Promoting Renewable Energy in European Countries, Environmental and Resource Economics, 49, 3, pp. 351-366, (2011); Key Renewable Trends Excerpt from Renewable Energy Information, (2016); Environmental Impacts of A North American Free Trade Agreement, (1991); Shafik, Nemat, Economic development and environmental quality: An econometric analysis, Oxford Economic Papers, 46, pp. 757-773, (1994); Apergis, Nicholas, Renewable energy consumption and economic growth: Evidence from a panel of OECD countries, Energy Policy, 38, 1, pp. 656-660, (2010); Sadorsky, Perry A., Renewable energy consumption and income in emerging economies, Energy Policy, 37, 10, pp. 4021-4028, (2009)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18790682; 09601481","9780123750259","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053182194"

Ltd., Hanoi, Viet Nam","Difficulties in breeding new rice cultivars that have a high yield, are acceptable quality, and are tolerant to environmental stresses have been the major constraint of rice production in many developing countries, as these traits are determined by multiple genes associated with complicated and uncontrollable gene segregations.Furthermore, the gene/QTL (quantitative trait locus) introduced to the cultivar is unstable due to the interaction among the active genes, which determine the phenotypic performance, not yet been well understood or controllable. In this study, the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mutation was applied to the heterozygote of the F<inf>1</inf> generation from the cross between TBR<inf>1</inf> (female) and KD<inf>18</inf> (male parent). The phenotype and genotype of the M<inf>2</inf> and M<inf>3</inf> generations were evaluated and showed that the mutant population phenotypes, including the plant height, semi-dwarfism, amylose content, protein content, gel consistency, grain yield, and spikelet fertility, varied. Interestingly, no segregation among the genotypes in the M<inf>2</inf> andM<inf>3</inf> generations was observed, while the genotypes of the control population were either paternally inherited or indeterminable when using 28 polymorphism simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that were identified on parental lines from 200 markers. The MNU-induced mutation caused maternal inheritance in the segregating populations, as primarily important agronomic traits were maternally succeeded from the female line TBR<inf>1</inf>. The findings of this study indicated that, through the use of MNU, the breeding of rice cultivars with close genetic backgrounds (similarity coefficient = 0.52) could be shortened by the maternal control of important qualities, such as pest and disease resistance and high yield, thus contributing to sustainable rice production for rice farmers. Further examination of rice cultivars with a greater difference in the genetic background should be subsequently conducted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Important Agronomic Trait; Maternal Inheritance; Mnu Mutation; Rice; Rice Breeding; Ssr Marker; Sustainable Rice Production; Agronomy; Alternative Agriculture; Chemical Compound; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Cultivar; Developing World; Disease Resistance; Genetic Marker; Genotype; High Yielding Variety; Mutation; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Rice; Oryza Sativa","agronomy; alternative agriculture; chemical compound; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; developing world; disease resistance; genetic marker; genotype; high yielding variety; mutation; phenotype; plant breeding; rice; Oryza sativa","","","","Xuan, T.

The obtained materials were characterized by modern methods. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics model described the precursor mechanism of the reaction well through an intermediate compound. The low activation energy showed that the reaction was mainly controlled by diffusion. The positive activation enthalpy proved the endothermic nature of the activation process, and this process did not alter the inside structure of the catalyst. The thermodynamic parameters of the reaction were determined, which implied that the oxidation was endothermic and spontaneous at 303 K. The more negative values of the Gibbs free energy from 283 to 323 K confirmed that the reaction was more favorable at high temperatures.

Then the annealing diffusion treatment at 1100 °C for 1 h in flowing Ar atmosphere was conducted to develop Pt and Pt-Ir diffusion coatings. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 1150 °C in still air in order to investigate the thermal stability and oxidation behavior of the coatings and they were compared with electroplated diffusion coatings. It was found that Ir can retard the formation of voids in both the coatings and substrates. In addition, by replacing the electroplating method to the paste coating method, the crack problem due to the brittle feature of electroplated Pt-Ir coatings could be solved. Therefore, the Pt-Ir diffusion coating prepared by the paste-coating method is promising as the bond-coat material due to suppression of voids, cracks and stable Al2O3 on the surface. The Pt-Ir paste diffusion coatings introduced above have several further advantages: they are easy to recoat, cause less damage to substrates, and offer comparable oxidation resistance. Thus, the method can be applicable to the remanufacturing of blades, which may extend the life of components. The future aspect of the paste coating will also be discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diffusion; Ir; Oxidation; Paste Coatings; Pt; Alumina; Aluminum Oxide; Binary Alloys; Diffusion; Diffusion Coatings; Nickel Alloys; Oxidation Resistance; Platinum; Single Crystals; Superalloys; Coating Methods; Cyclic Oxidation Tests; Diffusion Treatment; Ir; Nano Powders; Ni-based Single Crystal Superalloy; Oxidation Protection; Paste Coatings; Pt; Stability Behavior; Oxidation","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Binary alloys; Diffusion; Diffusion coatings; Nickel alloys; Oxidation resistance; Platinum; Single crystals; Superalloys; Coating methods; Cyclic oxidation tests; Diffusion treatment; Ir; Nano powders; Ni-based single crystal superalloy; Oxidation protection; Paste coatings; Pt; Stability behavior; Oxidation","","","","Izumi, Takeshi, Effects of targeted γ-Ni + γ′-Ni3Al-based coating compositions on oxidation behavior, Surface and Coatings Technology, 202, 4-7, pp. 628-631, (2007); Zhang, Ying, Interdiffusion behavior of Pt-diffused γ + γ′ coatings on Ni-based superalloys, Surface and Coatings Technology, 203, 5-7, pp. 417-421, (2008); Selezneff, Serge, Thermal cycling behavior of EBPVD TBC systems deposited on doped Pt-rich γ-γ' bond coatings made by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS), Surface and Coatings Technology, 206, 7, pp. 1558-1565, (2011); Wu, Yingna, Hot corrosion behavior of Pt-Ir modified aluminide coatings on the nickel-base single crystal superalloy TMS-82+, Journal of Materials Research, 22, 1, pp. 206-216, (2007); Suzuki, Aya S., Oxidation behavior of Pt-Ir modified aluminized coatings on Ni-base single crystal superalloy TMS-82+, Oxidation of Metals, 68, 1-2, pp. 53-64, (2007); Oskay, Ceyhun, Oxide scale formation and microstructural degradation of conventional, Pt- and Pt/Ir-modified NiAl diffusion coatings during thermocyclic exposure at 1100 °C, Corrosion Science, 144, pp. 313-327, (2018); Yasui, Yoshito, Oxidation resistance of electroplated Pt-Ir alloy coatings on Ni-based single crystal superalloys followed by diffusion annealing treatment, Nippon Kinzoku Gakkaishi/Journal of the Japan Institute of Metals, 73, 12, pp. 913-918, (2009); Mater Trans; Tawancy, H.

The beams considered in this paper consists of three layers, a homogeneous ceramic core, and two functionally graded skin layers. Material properties of the skin layers are supposed to vary in both the thickness and length directions by power gradation laws. Based on a refined shear deformation beam theory, in which the transverse displacement is split into bending and shear parts, a novel finite element formulation is derived and employed in the analysis. Natural frequencies and dynamic response to a harmonic load of the beams with various boundary conditions are computed, and the influence of the material distribution and the layer thickness ratio on the vibration characteristics of the beams is highlighted. Numerical results reveal that the variation of the material properties in the longitudinal direction has a significant influence on the vibration behavior of the beams, and FGSW beams can be designed to achieve desired vibration characteristics by appropriate selection of material grading indexes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d-fgsw Beam; Finite Element Formulation; Refined Shear Deformation Theory; Vibration Analysis","","","","This work was supported by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant no. 107.02\u20132018.23.","Koizumi, Mitsue J., FGM activities in Japan, Composites Part B: Engineering, 28, 1-2, pp. 1-4, (1997); Pradhan, Suresh Chandra, Thermo-mechanical vibration of FGM sandwich beam under variable elastic foundations using differential quadrature method, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 321, 1-2, pp. 342-362, (2009); Chehel Amirani, Morteza, Free vibration analysis of sandwich beam with FG core using the element free Galerkin method, Composite Structures, 90, 3, pp. 373-379, (2009); Mashat, Daoud Suleiman, Free vibration of FGM layered beams by various theories and finite elements, Composites Part B: Engineering, 59, pp. 269-278, (2014); Bennai, Riadh, A new higher-order shear and normal deformation theory for functionally graded sandwich beams, Steel and Composite Structures, 19, 3, pp. 521-546, (2015); Vo, Thuc, Finite element model for vibration and buckling of functionally graded sandwich beams based on a refined shear deformation theory, Engineering Structures, 64, pp. 12-22, (2014); Vo, Thuc, A quasi-3D theory for vibration and buckling of functionally graded sandwich beams, Composite Structures, 119, pp. 1-12, (2015); Su, Zhu, A general Fourier formulation for vibration analysis of functionally graded sandwich beams with arbitrary boundary condition and resting on elastic foundations, Acta Mechanica, 227, 5, pp. 1493-1514, (2016); Şi̇mşek, Mesut, Bi-directional functionally graded materials (BDFGMs) for free and forced vibration of Timoshenko beams with various boundary conditions, Composite Structures, 133, pp. 968-978, (2015); Wang, Zhihai, Free vibration of two-directional functionally graded beams, Composite Structures, 135, pp. 191-198, (2016)","","Taiwan Association of Engineering and Technology Innovation","","","","","","25182994; 24150436","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116917814"

This paper incorporates aggregate demand and alternative oil shocks to investigate the causal relationship between agricultural products and oil markets. For the period January 2000–July 2018, monthly spot prices of 15 commodities are examined, including Brent crude oil, biofuel-related agricultural commodities, and other agricultural commodities. The sample is divided into three sub-periods, namely: (i) January 2000–July 2006, (ii) August 2006–April 2013, and (iii) May 2013–July 2018. The structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition technique are used to examine how the shocks to agricultural markets contribute to the variance of crude oil prices. The empirical findings from the paper indicate that not every oil shock contributes the same to agricultural price fluctuations, and similarly for the effects of aggregate demand shocks on the agricultural market. These results show that the crude oil market plays a major role in explaining fluctuations in the prices and associated volatility of agricultural commodities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Commodity Prices; Crude Oil Prices; Decomposition; Impulse Response Functions; Structural Vector Autoregressive Model; Volatility; Aggregates; Agricultural Products; Commerce; Costs; Crude Oil; Decomposition; Impulse Response; Agricultural Commodities; Crude Oil Prices; Impulse Response Functions; Structural Vector Autoregressive Models; Volatility; Oils And Fats","Aggregates; Agricultural products; Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Decomposition; Impulse response; Agricultural commodities; Crude oil prices; Impulse response functions; Structural vector autoregressive models; Volatility; Oils and fats","","","Acknowledgments: The authors are most grateful to five reviewers for very helpful comments and suggestions.

The shrimp industry in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam makes a substantial contribution to national economy via exporting to foreign countries. Nevertheless, the shrimp aquaculture sector requires high energy for aeration systems to maintain suitable dissolved oxygen level in ponds continuously for improving water quality and promoting shrimp growth. The designs of mechanical aerators have been amended to save energy costs and increase oxygen transfer; moreover, their operation is optimized to reduce operational costs, and renewable energy has been recently started applying to power aerators to mitigate energy security and environmental impacts. However, electric motors driving aerators inherently consume a lot of power, leading to high operational costs and potential impacts from using conventional power resources. In order to attain economical production and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the sustainable energy model for shrimp farms is proposed in this paper. The energy model exploits renewable energy to power the advanced aeration system for shrimp ponds, which might produce the onsite oxygen while the by-product hydrogen is stored and might be used to regenerate electricity to compensate imbalance when power load demand is higher than renewable power sources. The optimal design for renewable power resources according to the oxygen consumption of shrimp and the optimal operation of innovative aeration system based on the changes of dissolved oxygen at ponds are presented elaborately with the main objectives being economical and environmentally sustainable production for shrimp farms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aeration System; Electrolyzer; Renewable Energy; Shrimp Farm; Sustainability; Dissolved Oxygen; Energy Conservation; Energy Policy; Energy Security; Environmental Impact; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Lakes; Salinity Measurement; Shellfish; Sustainable Development; Water Quality; Aeration System; Conventional Power; Dissolved Oxygen Levels; Economical Production; Electrolyzers; Renewable Energies; Sustainable Energy; Sustainable Production; Renewable Energy Resources","Dissolved oxygen; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy security; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Salinity measurement; Shellfish; Sustainable development; Water quality; Aeration system; Conventional power; Dissolved oxygen levels; Economical production; Electrolyzers; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy; Sustainable production; Renewable energy resources","","","","Beveridge, Malcolm Charles Macrae, Meeting the food and nutrition needs of the poor: The role of fish and the opportunities and challenges emerging from the rise of aquaculturea, Journal of Fish Biology, 83, 4, pp. 1067-1084, (2013); Food Agriculture Orgn, (2018); Aquaculture Big Numbers, (2016); Amagliani, Giulia, Incidence and role of Salmonella in seafood safety, Food Research International, 45, 2, pp. 780-788, (2012); Operating Procedures for Shrimp Farming, (2006); Hatje, Vanessa, Detection of environmental impacts of shrimp farming through multiple lines of evidence, Environmental Pollution, 219, pp. 672-684, (2016); Ashton, Elizabeth Clare, The impact of shrimp farming on mangrove ecosystems, CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources, 3, (2008); Boyd, Claude Elson, Indicators of resource use efficiency and environmental performance in fish and crustacean aquaculture, Reviews in Fisheries Science, 15, 4, pp. 327-360, (2007); Aquaculture Asia, (2002); Boyd, Claude Elson, Pond water aeration systems, Aquacultural Engineering, 18, 1, pp. 9-40, (1998)","Perilhon, C.; Vokas, G.; Haider, A.; Aillerie, M.; Jabur, A.; Papageorgas, P.; Salame, C.-T.; Shaban, A.","Elsevier Ltd","","2018 Technologies and Materials for Renewable Energy, Environment and Sustainability, TMREES 2018","","Athens","144696","18766102","9781627483179; 9781627484299; 9781629935683; 9781409423836; 9781627484404; 9781627484312; 9781627484275; 9781409423829; 9781627484305","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064435598"

In our Vietnam-Japan joint project contributing to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a shrimp farm in Ben Tre (Mekong Delta area) was selected as a demonstration site for an energy circulation system that includes a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). We found that sludge accumulated during intensive-shrimp culture can be used as a source of methanogenic bacteria to decompose lignocellulosic and starch-based biomass. Bagasse and coconut pomace are mixed with the shrimp pond water containing organic matter and minerals, then supplied to a digester with seed sludge (shrimp pond sludge) to produce biogas, which converted to electricity using the SOFC system. The green electricity is used for shrimp culture, main industry of this region. Based on this concept, a pilot plant with 1 kW SOFC system was constructed at the shrimp farm in Ben Tre. So far, stable biogas production necessary for the continuous operation of the 1 kW SOFC was achieved by the daily supply of 6 kg of bagasse and 8 kg of coconut pomace (dry basis), and power generation efficiency of 53.1% (LHV: lower heating value) was achieved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogas; Biomass Waste; Energy Circulation; Shrimp Culture; Solid Oxide Fuel Cell; Bagasse; Biogas; Biomass; Calorific Value; Fuel Cells; Lakes; Organic Minerals; Pilot Plants; Planning; Shellfish; Sustainable Development; Biomass Wastes; Circulation Systems; Continuous Operation; Demonstration Sites; Green Electricity; Lower Heating Value; Power Generation Efficiency; Shrimp Culture; Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (sofc)","Bagasse; Biogas; Biomass; Calorific value; Fuel cells; Lakes; Organic minerals; Pilot plants; Planning; Shellfish; Sustainable development; Biomass wastes; Circulation systems; Continuous operation; Demonstration sites; Green electricity; Lower heating value; Power generation efficiency; Shrimp culture; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)","","","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).","undefined, (2017); Nguyen, Quoc Cuong, Study and evaluation on sustainable industrial development in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 86, pp. 389-402, (2015); Shiratori, Yusuke, Biogas production from local biomass feedstock in the Mekong Delta and its utilization for a direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 5, MAY, (2017); Alves, Helton José, Overview of hydrogen production technologies from biogas and the applications in fuel cells, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 38, 13, pp. 5215-5225, (2013); Bocci, Enrico, Biomass to fuel cells state of the art: A review of the most innovative technology solutions, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 39, 36, pp. 21876-21895, (2014); Hansen, John Bogild, Correlating sulfur poisoning of SOFC nickel anodes by a temkin isotherm, Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 11, 10, pp. B178-B180, (2008); Sasaki, Kazunari, Chemical durability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of impurities on long-term performance, Journal of Power Sources, 196, 22, pp. 9130-9140, (2011); Rasmussen, Jens F.B., The effect of H2S on the performance of SOFCs using methane containing fuel, Fuel Cells, 10, 6, pp. 1135-1142, (2010); de Arespacochaga, N., Biogas deep clean-up based on adsorption technologies for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell applications, Chemical Engineering Journal, 255, pp. 593-603, (2014); Abatzoglou, Nicolas, A review of biogas purification processes, Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining, 3, 1, pp. 42-71, (2009)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd vgorayska@wiley.com Southern Gate Chichester, West Sussex PO19 8SQ","","","","","","16156846; 16156854","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064258612"

Some conventional countermeasures such as on load tap changer, step voltage regulator, etc. have been applied to mitigate the voltage problems. However, these methodologies might not be enough to cope with PV output fluctuation due to the limitation in the number of tap changing operations or slow response of tap changers. On the other hand, it seems promising to use PV inverter control to solve the problems when PV units are allowed to inject or absorb reactive power. In particular, there is a possibility that PV inverter control can contribute to VU problem even if they are connected with low voltage single phase networks. This paper proposed a comprehensive inverter control strategy consisting of both reactive power control and active power curtailment to improve the operation performance of VU in medium voltage distribution network with high penetration of residential PV systems by minimizing network losses and active power curtailment with voltage quality constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated in consideration of solar insolation level which affects active power generation of PVs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distribution System; Optimal Power Flow (opf); Photovoltaic (pv) System; Power Quality; Reactive Power Control; Electric Inverters; Electric Load Flow; Power Quality; Problem Solving; Quality Control; Reactive Power; Voltage Control; Voltage Distribution Measurement; Voltage Regulators; Active Power Generation; Distribution Systems; Low Voltage Distribution System; Medium-voltage Distribution Networks; Optimal Power Flows; Photovoltaic Systems; Step Voltage Regulators; Three-phase Voltage Unbalance; Power Control","Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Power quality; Problem solving; Quality control; Reactive power; Voltage control; Voltage distribution measurement; Voltage regulators; Active power generation; Distribution systems; Low Voltage distribution system; Medium-voltage distribution networks; Optimal power flows; Photovoltaic systems; Step voltage regulators; Three-phase voltage unbalance; Power control","","","The authors would like to thank the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), CREST, JPMJCR15K2 for this work.","Canova, Aldo, Electrical impact of photovoltaic plant in distributed network, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 45, 1, pp. 341-347, (2009); International Journal of Electrical Computer Energetic Electronic and Communication Engineering, (2016); Tonkoski, Reinaldo, Impact of high PV penetration on voltage profiles in residential neighborhoods, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 3, 3, pp. 518-527, (2012); Singh, B.

To address the latter challenge (2), a compact SPL employing a rigid 76.2 mm caliber paraboloidal mirror and a 10 mm-long, 1 mm diameter Cr, Nd-doped YAG ceramic rod was developed to realize more stable oscillation performance by introducing rapid cooling by free/natural air convection and increased mechanical stability during wind exposure in contrast to the conventional large solar pumped lasers (SPLs) employing typically a 2 m size conversing lens or mirror.

In this study, water deficits in 2- and 3-day intervals were imposed on two Japonica cultivars K1 and K3, and an Indica K4 subtype after anthesis to harvest. It was observed that although rice yield was affected, the protein content was increased 6.53-6.63% to 9.93-10.16%. The amylose quantity was reduced significantly from 22.00-22.43% to 16.33-17.56%, while fatty acids in rice grain were not influenced. Total anthocyanins were greatly promoted by 53.1% as compared to the non-treated trials. The antioxidant capacity in rice grain increased up to 59.1% in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and 41.6% in reducing power assays. Findings of this research revealed that the 3-day interval of water deficit imposition was the most effective to improve rice macronutrients and quality, as well as beneficial phytochemicals and antioxidants in rice grain. The water control after anthesis to harvest in rice cultivation is beneficial and economical for farmers to improve rice nutrients and quality, thus contributes to the sustainable rice production in many developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amylose; Anthocyanins; Antioxidant Activity; Flavonoids; Phenols; Phytochemical; Protein; Water Deficit Stress; Antioxidant; Biochemical Composition; Cultivar; Phenol; Physiological Response; Phytochemistry; Protein; Rice; Secondary Metabolite; Senescence; Trace Element; Water Stress; Japonica","antioxidant; biochemical composition; cultivar; phenol; physiological response; phytochemistry; protein; rice; secondary metabolite; senescence; trace element; water stress; Japonica","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors thank Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for giving Ramin Rayee a scholarship.

Improving the investment climate may foster the development of the private sector by creating sustainable jobs and opportunities for entrepreneurs, which contributes to sustained poverty reduction in developing countries. This research examined the relationship between the investment climate and firm productivity by exploring a unique panel dataset of 1310 enterprises operating in the manufacturing sector in Vietnam. Productivity was measured as the total factor productivity (TFP) obtained by production function estimation using Levinsohn and Petrin's approach. Investment climate factors included infrastructure, labor skills, regulatory governance and institutions, and access to finance. It was shown that restrictions on the investment climate were harmful to firm productivity. The lack of Internet and financial accessibility, low educational level of employees, administrative burden and the cost of bribery were negatively associated with firm TFP. The results indicate that access to Internet and finance, and quality of labor should be further enhanced while administrative burden and corruption should be significantly reduced to strengthen the TFP. The findings of this study may provide insights for policymakers who aim to improve the investment climate and firm productivity and thereby contribute to the sustainable growth of the country. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Investment Climate; Small And Medium Enterprises; Total Factor Productivity; Vietnamese Manufacturing Sector; Investment Incentive; Manufacturing; Operations Technology; Panel Data; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Sustainability; Total Factor Productivity; Viet Nam","investment incentive; manufacturing; operations technology; panel data; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability; total factor productivity; Viet Nam","","","","World Development Report 2005 A Better Investment Climate for Everyone, (2004); Hall, Robert E., Why do some countries produce so much more output per worker than others?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114, 1, pp. 83-116, (1999); Bosworth, Barry P., The Empirics of Growth: An Update, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2, pp. 113-206, (2003); Dollar, David, Investment climate and firm performance in developing economies, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 54, 1, pp. 1-31, (2005); Assessing the Impact of the Investment Climate on Productivity Using Firm Level Data Methodology and the Cases of Guatemala Honduras and Nicaragua, (2005); Kinda, Tidiane, Firm productivity and investment climate in developing countries: How does Middle East and North Africa manufacturing perform?, Developing Economies, 49, 4, pp. 429-462, (2011); Vu, Khuong M., The Dynamics of Economic Growth: Policy Insights from Comparative Analyses in Asia, pp. 1-262, (2013); China Statistical Yearbook 2005, (2025); Global Competitiveness Report 2017 2018, (2017); Doing Business 2018 Reforming to Create Jobs, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058615320"

Voltage limits are usually fulfilled either by voltage controllers or power control of PV units. Amongst PV control methods, P(V), Q(V) droop approach is effective to cope with voltage problems under load and PV fluctuation. However, using fixed parameters or optimizing only one parameter in previous studies might restrict the robustness of this approach. Furthermore, PV outputs are adjusted based on the local measured quantities so it is impossible to optimize the network operation e.g. network loss minimization.

Nowadays, the energy storage systems have become increasingly viable. The energy storage system helps to balance the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources. Therefore, in the generation and expansion planning studies, both renewable sources and energy storage devices should be considered in a single optimization problem. This approach leads to highly complicated optimization models, especially when several uncertainty factors are included. This paper proposes a stochastic optimization model to determine optimal combinations of wind turbines and energy storage systems. The optimization takes into account the uncertainty in wind generation.

The O<inf>2</inf> concentrations included 21%, 15% and 10% O<inf>2</inf>, while the injection pressures were 80 and 120 MPa. The experimental fuels were the diesel fuel (B7), the neat HVO, the 20%, 50% and 80% HVO (by mass fraction) blended with the diesel. The experiments were carried out in a rapid compression-expansion machine (RCEM) under the direct injection (DI) diesel combustion condition. The analysis was undertaken using the two-color method. The experimental results indicated that the ignition delay, the heat release rate, the flame temperature, the soot density-KL factor, the NO<inf>x</inf> and soot-out emissions were inversely correlated to the HVO fraction in the blend. In addition, the findings revealed the similar flame profiles in which the higher flame temperature region and the darker KL density were concentrated around the spray flame upstream, regardless of the HVO mixing ratio. Besides, the decrease in the O<inf>2</inf> concentration resulted in the lower heat release rate, integral heat release, flame temperature, KL factor and NO<inf>x</inf> emissions but the longer ignition delay and higher soot concentration, with the highest soot concentration observed under the 15% O<inf>2</inf> environment. Nevertheless, the higher pressure differential (i.e. between the injection pressure and the ambient pressure) contributed to the shorter ignition delay, higher heat release rate, early peak of the flame temperature, wider combustion area, faster soot oxidation rate and higher NO<inf>x</inf> production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diesel Combustion; High Injection Pressure; Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (hvo); Nox-soot Emissions; Two-color Method; Diesel Engines; Diesel Fuels; Dust; Fuels; Ignition; Nitrogen Oxides; Soot; Temperature Measurement; Vegetable Oils; Diesel Combustion; High Injection Pressures; Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (hvo); Soot Emissions; Two-color Method; Direct Injection","Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Dust; Fuels; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Temperature measurement; Vegetable oils; Diesel combustion; High injection pressures; Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO); Soot emissions; Two-color method; Direct injection","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Thailand's King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang's Research Fund (Grant No. KREF125615) and the AUN/SEED-Net program under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Graphene doped by heteroatoms has been regarded as a material having a high reduction catalytic activity to develop efficient Pt-free alternative CE. However, the doping effects accounting for such a catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, by means of density functional theory calculations, we determined the band gaps, formation energies, and regions of charge-induced impurities to examine the possibilities of B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped graphene (BNG) sheets to replace platinum as CE. Our results demonstrated that the B-N co-doped graphene (BNG) is suitable to be used for CE owing to its small band gap, small formation energy, and having appropriate region of charge-induced impurities. In addition, we considered the iodide reduction reaction on the negatively charged BNG sheet. After injecting two extra electrons, the I<inf>2</inf> molecule can strongly adsorb on the BNG surface and the I<inf>2</inf> decomposition can be achieved with a small activation energy.

This study aims to evaluate factors associated with the regularity of exercise and sports (EAS) among Vietnamese people living in the capital city of Hanoi, using data collected from a randomized survey involving 2068 individuals conducted in 2016. Physical exercises and daily sports are considered a major means for improving the Vietnamese social public health system by the government, families, and individuals. Applying the baseline-category logit model, the study analyzed two groups of factors associated with EAS regularity: (i) physiological factors (sex, body mass index (BMI)) and (ii) external factors (education, health communication, medical practice at home). Females with a university education or higher usually exercise less than those with lower education, while the opposite is true for males. The study also shows that those with a higher BMI tend to report higher activity levels. Additionally, improved health communication systems and regular health check-ups at home are also associated with more frequent EAS activities.

Systematic metalation is considered with various cations (i.e., Ni2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+). Utilizing the advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we observe that the imidazole linking units suffer severe deformation in the ast and pts networks, as pointed out by the negative phonon modes. The mechanical stability is then verified by analyzing the elastic tensors (C<inf>ij</inf>), and we conclude four structures to acquire mechanical stability: pth-1 (NiMn), pth-2 (NiCo), pth-3 (NiZn), and pth-6 (CuZn). Electronic structure analysis suggests the first two structures to exhibit strong magnetism, whereas the latter are weakly or even nonpolarized, which establishes good agreement with the ligand-field theory prediction. The band gaps of those structures fall in the range of 0.74 to 1.78 eV, as estimated by conventional DFT calculations. Finally, we investigate the CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity over N<inf>2</inf> within pth-1 and pth-3 by conducting grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for gas adsorption. For the pth-1 (NiMn) and pth-3 (NiZn) cases, the load of CO<inf>2</inf> dominantly exceeds the uptake of N<inf>2</inf> at the pressure up to 1 bar, indicating those structure to be promising in CO<inf>2</inf> capture and selectivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Binary Alloys; Carbon Dioxide; Design For Testability; Electronic Structure; Energy Gap; Gas Adsorption; Intelligent Systems; Manganese Alloys; Mechanical Stability; Monte Carlo Methods; Topology; Building Blockes; Co2 Selectivity; Dft Calculation; Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation; Ligand Field Theory; Severe Deformation; Topological Category; Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks; Density Functional Theory","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Design for testability; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Gas adsorption; Intelligent systems; Manganese alloys; Mechanical stability; Monte Carlo methods; Topology; Building blockes; CO2 selectivity; DFT calculation; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Ligand field theory; Severe Deformation; Topological category; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Density functional theory","","","H.L.N. expresses gratitude to Dr. Hiroyasu Furukawa (University of California, Berkeley) and Dr. Felipe Gańdara (Materials Science Institute of Madrid, CSIC, Spain) for the initial discussion in this work.

Two aviation biofuels produced by hydroprocessing of coconut oil, four jet range normal paraffins (n-paraffins), iso-octane, and propylbenzene were used to investigate the effects of chain length of n-paraffins, iso-paraffins, and aromatics on the sooting tendency. The results show that the effect of propylbenzene on the smoke point of the mixtures is dominant compared to that of the chain length of n-paraffins and the fraction of iso-paraffins. The differences in the sooting tendency among these n-paraffins are insignificant. In addition, blending aviation biofuels with Jet A1 leads to a decrease in the sooting tendency.

There are various measures proposed in the INDC, but studies to assess their potential effectiveness are still needed. An input–output based linear programming model is developed in this work to evaluate the maximum GHG emission reductions which can be achieved, given various climate change mitigation strategies. Six scenarios are considered to identify the highest GHG emission reduction that can be achieved by the year 2030. These scenarios include BAU, the consideration of two different levels of differentiated sector growth, the adoption of a low-carbon electricity mix, energy efficiency enhancement for final consumption, and energy efficiency enhancement in the agriculture, transport and waste sectors. Each scenario quantifies the sector final demand, sector gross output, sector GHG emission load and the impact on human health. Results show that the best strategy is to simultaneously implement all of the identified low-carbon measures, which achieves a 24.6% reduction in overall GHG emissions in comparison to BAU levels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Policy; Disability Adjusted Life Years; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Input–output Analysis; Linear Programming; Optimization","","","","The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to study and conduct this research.","Aviso, Kathleen B., Fuzzy input-output model for optimizing eco-industrial supply chains under water footprint constraints, Journal of Cleaner Production, 19, 2-3, pp. 187-196, (2011); Cayamanda, Christina D., Mapping a Low-Carbon Future for the Philippines: Scenario Results from a Fractional Programming Input-Output Model, Process Integration and Optimization for Sustainability, 1, 4, pp. 293-299, (2017); Chen, Tser Yieth, The impact of mitigating CO 2 emissions on Taiwan's economy, Energy Economics, 23, 2, pp. 141-151, (2001); Cohen, Brett, Modelling approaches for greenhouse gas emissions projections from the waste sector, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 10, pp. 15-20, (2017); undefined; de Carvalho, Ariovaldo Lopes, A multi-objective interactive approach to assess economic-energy-environment trade-offs in Brazil, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 54, pp. 1429-1442, (2016); de Schryver, An M., Characterization factors for global warming in life cycle assessment based on damages to humans and ecosystems, Environmental Science and Technology, 43, 6, pp. 1689-1695, (2009); Fan, Ying, Estimating the macroeconomic costs of CO2 emission reduction in China based on multi-objective programming, Advances in Climate Change Research, 1, 1, pp. 27-33, (2010); Climate Change 2007 the Physical Science Basis, (2007); undefined, (2013)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","23525509","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050828651"

Unlike the conventional configuration where one electrode generates charged ions moving towards the reference electrode, this configuration allows both negative and positive charges to simultaneously move away from the device and generate ion wind in parallel with the electrodes. In comparison with the direct current (DC) driven corona generator, the time oscillating AC field allows the device a better stabilization owing to the independence of ion wind strength from the inter-electrode spacing. Our results by both simulation and experiment showed that when the AC frequency exceeds a threshold value of 1100 Hz, the electric field at the electrode tips is determined dominantly by the charge cloud created in the previous half-cycle, resulting in stronger net electric field and thus stronger ion wind. In addition, the electrode separation in the AC driven corona based generator is less critical above the frequency threshold, yielding a more robust design with minimized susceptibility to manufacturing tolerances and impurities on the electrodes. Moreover, lower voltage levels of the AC driven system allow simpler and more economical design in the high voltage circuit of the AC generator. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternating Current; Bipolar Discharge; Ion Wind; Parallel Pin; Electric Impedance Measurement; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; Hvdc Power Transmission; Ions; Alternating Current; Bipolar Discharge; Electrode Separation; High Voltage Circuits; Inter-electrode Spacing; Ion Wind; Manufacturing Tolerances; Parallel Pin; Electric Discharges","Electric impedance measurement; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; HVDC power transmission; Ions; Alternating current; Bipolar discharge; Electrode separation; High voltage circuits; Inter-electrode spacing; Ion wind; Manufacturing tolerances; Parallel pin; Electric discharges","","","Tung Thanh Bui would like to thank Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) for financial support under grant 107.99-2016.36 .","Moreau, Éric, Airflow control by non-thermal plasma actuators, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 40, 3, pp. 605-636, (2007); Corke, Thomas C., Dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators for flow control, Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 42, pp. 505-529, (2010); undefined, (2012); Alamgholilou, A., Experimental investigation on hydrodynamics and heat transfer of fluid flow into channel for cooling of rectangular ribs by passive and EHD active enhancement methods, Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, 38, pp. 61-73, (2012); Go, David B., Direct simulation of ionization and ion transport for planar microscale ion generation devices, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 42, 5, (2009); Kibler, Kenneth G., Electrocooling in gases, Journal of Applied Physics, 45, 10, pp. 4436-4440, (1974); Rashkovan, Alexander, Experimental optimization of an electric blower by corona wind, Applied Thermal Engineering, 22, 14, pp. 1587-1599, (2002); Martins, Alexandre A., Modelling of an improved positive corona thruster and actuator, Journal of Electrostatics, 71, 1, pp. 61-67, (2013); Zhao, Lin, Numerical analysis of forces in an electrostatic levitation unit, Journal of Electrostatics, 63, 6-10, pp. 729-734, (2005); Martins, Alexandre A., On the influence that the ground electrode diameter has in the propulsion efficiency of an asymmetric capacitor in nitrogen gas, Physics of Plasmas, 18, 3, (2011)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","08941777","","ETFSE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046667257"

The increasing presence of wind farms with electronic controls pose several issues for the protective relaying systems. The issues with conventional protection relays when applied to wind farm protection is due to the fact that short circuit currents from wind farm, especially those based on type III and type IV, are fundamentally different from short-circuit currents of synchronous generators. This paper investigates the performance of a typical differential protection scheme for a 110kV power transformer which connects a DFIG wind farm to the grid. The simulation results show that wind farm short circuit current might cause incorrect relay operation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Power System Relaying; Short-circuit Current; Wind Power; Asynchronous Generators; Electric Power System Protection; Electric Utilities; Power Transformers; Relay Protection; Short Circuit Currents; Smart Power Grids; Transformer Protection; Wind Power; Conventional Protections; Differential Protection; Differential Relaying; Electronic Controls; Power System Relaying; Protective Relaying; Relay Operations; Renewable Energies; Electric Power Transmission Networks","Asynchronous generators; Electric power system protection; Electric utilities; Power transformers; Relay protection; Short circuit currents; Smart power grids; Transformer protection; Wind power; Conventional protections; Differential protection; Differential relaying; Electronic controls; Power system relaying; Protective relaying; Relay operations; Renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks","","","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology research fund T2015-152, along with the Hitachi Global Foundation award 2017.","A Report to the T D Committee Electric Machinery Committee and Power System Relaying Committee of the IEEE Pes, (2012); Muljadi, Eduard B., Short circuit current contribution for different wind turbine generator types, (2010); Jain, Rishabh, Performance of line protection and supervisory elements for doubly fed wind turbines, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2015-September, (2015); Gao, Bingtuan, Differential protection for an outgoing transformer of large-scale doubly fed induction generator-based wind farms, Energies, 7, 9, pp. 5566-5585, (2014); Abad, Gonzalo, Doubly Fed Induction Machine: Modeling and Control for Wind Energy Generation, (2011); Miller, Nicholas W., Dynamic modeling of GE 1.5 and 3.6 MW wind turbine-generators for stability simulations, 3, pp. 1977-1983, (2003); IEEE Std C37 91 2008 Revision of IEEE Std C37 91 2000, (2008); Theory for CT Sat Calculator, (2003); Siprotec 7ut613 63x Instruction Manual; Patel, Suhag P., Fundamentals of transformer inrush, pp. 290-300, (2011)","Hao, Q.; Sharma, A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2018 International Conference on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies, ISGT Asia 2018","","Singapore","139973","","9781538642917","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055543835"

BRM reactions were conducted under atmospheric condition with varying reactant partial pressure in the range of 10–45 kPa and 1073 K in fixed-bed reactor. The ordered hexagonal mesoporous SBA-15 support possessing large specific surface area of 669.5 m2 g−1 was well preserved with NiO addition during incipient wetness impregnation. Additionally, NiO species with mean crystallite dimension of 14.5 nm were randomly distributed over SBA-15 support surface and inside its mesoporous channels. Thus, these particles were reduced at various temperatures depending on different degrees of metal-support interaction. At stoichiometric condition and 1073 K, CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> conversions were about 61.6% and 58.9%, respectively whilst H<inf>2</inf>/CO ratio of 2.14 slightly superior to theoretical value for BRM would suggest the predominance of methane steam reforming. H<inf>2</inf> and CO yields were significantly enhanced with increasing CO<inf>2</inf>/(CH<inf>4</inf> + H<inf>2</inf>O) ratio due to growing CO<inf>2</inf> gasification rate of partially dehydrogenated species from CH<inf>4</inf> decomposition. Additionally, a considerable decline of H<inf>2</inf> to CO ratio from 2.14 to 1.83 was detected with reducing H<inf>2</inf>O/(CH<inf>4</inf> + CO<inf>2</inf>) ratio due to dominant reverse water-gas shift side reaction at H<inf>2</inf>O-deficient feedstock. Interestingly, 10%Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was resistant to graphitic carbon formation in the co-occurrence of H<inf>2</inf>O and CO<inf>2</inf> oxidizing agents and the mesoporous catalyst structure was still maintained after BRM. A strong correlation between formation of carbonaceous species and catalytic activity was observed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mesoporous Silica; Methane Bi-reforming; Ni/sba-15; Syngas; Carbon Dioxide; Catalyst Activity; Chemical Reactors; Mesoporous Materials; Methane; Nickel Oxide; Silica; Synthesis Gas; Synthesis Gas Manufacture; Water Gas Shift; Incipientwetness Impregnation; Large Specific Surface Areas; Mesoporous Silica; Metal-support Interactions; Methane Steam Reforming; Ni/sba-15; Reverse Water Gas Shift; Syn-gas; Steam Reforming","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Chemical reactors; Mesoporous materials; Methane; Nickel oxide; Silica; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Water gas shift; Incipientwetness impregnation; Large specific surface areas; Mesoporous Silica; Metal-support interactions; Methane steam reforming; Ni/SBA-15; Reverse water gas shift; Syn-gas; Steam reforming","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP Research Grant Scheme, RDU170326).

Moreover, water productivity or water use efficiency in rice production was quite low in the region due to free-rider problem. Therefore, the study was aimed at measuring water use efficiency at farm level and investigating the factors affecting water use efficiency. The study applied stochastic frontier analysis to estimate water use efficiency for 159 rice farmers in the upstream of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The study shows that the average water use efficiency was 18.81%, indicating that rice farmers did consume water very inefficiently. On the average, the rice farmers could reduce their water consumption about 81.19%, keeping their output level and other inputs constant. To improve water use efficiency, the study found that land accumulation or large-scaled production is essential. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Tobit Regression; Water Use Efficiency; Agriculture; Efficiency; Stochastic Systems; Water Supply; Climate Change Adaptation; Dam Construction; Mekong Delta; Rice Farmers; Rice Production; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Tobit Regression; Vietnamese; Water Scarcity; Water Use Efficiency; Climate Change","Agriculture; Efficiency; Stochastic systems; Water supply; Climate change adaptation; Dam construction; Mekong Delta; Rice farmers; Rice production; Stochastic frontier analysis; Tobit regression; Vietnamese; Water scarcity; Water use efficiency; Climate change","","","This research (ID number R11616) was funded by RONPAKU, JSPS.

In particular, in recent years, the amount and speed of data handled in high-energy physics experiments have significantly increased, because signal waveforms from detectors are often recorded without reduction to maximize the flexibility of the offline analysis. To best exploit the available bandwidth of such data acquisition systems with waveform recording, we developed the real-time lossless waveform-compression firmware that is based on a delta-encoding technique. The firmware provides a compression ratio of 34% of the raw data produced, the fast analog-to-digital converter (FADC) boards of our application before transmission to a host computer. The resource consumption of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is not large, and a low-cost mid-range FPGA is sufficient to implement this proposed firmware. The firmware has been successfully implemented on an FADC board and was utilized to record signals from multiwire proportional chambers for the DeeMe experiment. In this paper, we present the theory related to the firmware design and its implementation on the FPGA. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fast Analog-to-digital-converter (fadc); Field-programmable Gate Array (fpga); High-energy Physics; Lossless Data Compression; Analog To Digital Conversion; Bandwidth; Data Acquisition; Data Compression Ratio; Data Transfer Rates; Field Programmable Gate Arrays (fpga); Firmware; Logic Gates; Real Time Systems; Analog To Digital Converters; Data Acquisition System; Fast Analog-to-digitalconverter (fadc); High Energy Physics Experiments; Lossless Compression; Lossless Data Compression; Multi-wire Proportional Chambers; Programmable Gate Array; High Energy Physics","Analog to digital conversion; Bandwidth; Data acquisition; Data compression ratio; Data transfer rates; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Firmware; Logic gates; Real time systems; Analog to digital converters; Data acquisition system; fast analog-to-digitalconverter (FADC); High energy physics experiments; Lossless compression; Lossless data compression; Multi-wire proportional chambers; Programmable gate array; High energy physics","","","Manuscript received May 11, 2018; revised June 30, 2018; accepted July 3, 2018.

We use the appropriate absorption cross section to determine the solar energy absorption efficiency of the nano-heterostructures, which is strongly structure-dependent, and to predict the time-dependent temperature increase of the nanoshell solution under simulated solar irradiation. Comparisons to prior temperature measurements and theoretical evaluation of the solar power conversion efficiency are discussed to provide new insights into underlying mechanisms.

The application of PV generation forecasts and the utilization of energy storage devices in power system operation are essential to reduce supply-demand imbalances and enable the use of more PV energy without curtailment. In this paper, assuming extremely high PV generation after 2030, we focus on the coordinated operation of a battery energy storage system (BESS) and conventional power plants. We propose a method of determining and updating the BESS charging/discharging schedule and generator unit commitment based on the day-ahead and intraday PV generation forecasts.

This study investigated the nutrient composition of so-called organic fertilizers in Vietnam's markets and issues related to their production, and evaluated their potential to contaminate the groundwater. We analyzed the physicochemical properties of 12 domestic and four imported products of the fertilizers, and conducted a cultivation experiment in sandy soil with the fertilizer applied at a rate of 200 mg N kg-1 soil using an automatic watering apparatus in a greenhouse. We further studied the production of an ""organic fertilizer"" from coffee by-products. The nutrient content greatly varied among domestic products, whereas they were quite similar among imported products. The product packaging of the collected samples lacked information regarding raw materials. Two thirds of the domestic products contained over 30% of the total N in the inorganic form, implying that the N content dramatically increased in the fertilizers rather than in their supposed raw materials. The stages involved in the production were composting, the addition of extra soil as a bulking agent, and the mixing-in of chemical substances to increase the nutrient content before packing. The remarkably high ratio of inorganic N to total N was attributed to excessive N leaching from soil by the application of domestic fertilizers. These results suggested the need for quality criteria guidelines for organic fertilizers in Vietnam that underline not only nutrient levels, but also the control of raw materials and production process of compost, because they are closely related to nutrient uptake and the leaching loss of nutrients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coffee By-products; N Leaching; Nutrient Composition; Production; So-called Organic Fertilizer; Byproduct; Chemical Substance; Crop Production; Developing World; Fertilizer; Groundwater Pollution; Leaching; Market Conditions; Nutrient Loss; Nutrient Uptake; Physicochemical Property; Sandy Soil; Viet Nam","byproduct; chemical substance; crop production; developing world; fertilizer; groundwater pollution; leaching; market conditions; nutrient loss; nutrient uptake; physicochemical property; sandy soil; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This research was funded by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and the Research Grant for Encouragement of Students, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Japan.","Parvathi, Priyanka, Fair Trade and Organic Agriculture in Developing Countries: A Review, Journal of International Food and Agribusiness Marketing, 25, 4, pp. 311-323, (2013); Rehber, Erkan, Prospects and challenges for developing countries in trade and production of organic food and fibers: The case of Turkey, British Food Journal, 104, pp. 371-390, (2002); Proceedings of the 4th Ansoftworkshop Gwangju, (2012); Production and Supply Chain Management of Organic Food in Vietnam; undefined; Proceedings of the Asian Soil Partnership Consultationworkshop on Sustainable Management and Protection of Soil Resources Bangkok Thailand 13 15 May 2015; Proceedings of the Japan Vietnam Research Workshop on Sustainable Society Development in Asian Countries Talking Climate Change, (2015); Vu, Quyet Manh, Socio-economic and biophysical determinants of land degradation in Vietnam: An integrated causal analysis at the national level, Land Use Policy, 36, pp. 605-617, (2014); Nguyen, Trung Thanh, Does land tenure security promote manure use by farm households in Vietnam?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 8, 2, (2016); Ho, Thong Quoc, Eco-efficiency analysis of sustainability-certified coffee production in Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 183, pp. 251-260, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049897991"

This study observed seasonal variation of inorganic nitrogen concentrations in small drainage streams that receive discharge predominantly from three different types of agricultural practices, swine farms, aquaculture, and paddy fields, in the Tha Chin River Basin in central Thailand. The drainage streams had high inorganic nitrogen concentrations, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (<3 mg L−1), and ammonium was the dominant form of inorganic nitrogen. The highest ammonium concentrations were observed in the drainage streams through swine farm areas, exceeding 4 mg L−1 throughout the year. In-stream ammonium retention was examined using pulse co-injections of ammonium and chloride in a drainage stream, and the effects of in-channel vegetation on ammonium retention were evaluated. This study showed that a considerable amount of ammonium was retained with the presence of in-channel vegetation. After vegetation removal, both the hydraulic and ammonium uptake length increased by >50 m, and the ammonium retention declined by approximately 50%. These results suggest that small agricultural streams experience a high concentration of inorganic nitrogen, similar or even more than larger streams, and that in-channel vegetation plays important role in nitrogen retention. The management of in-channel vegetation will have considerable effects on nitrogen transport. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Streams; Ammonium Retention; Tracer Injection; Tropical Streams","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: We thank the Faculty of the Environment and Resource Studies at Mahidol University and the Faculty of Engineering at the Kasetsart University (Kamphaengsean campus) for allowing us to use their facilities.

The sulfonic acid functionality was introduced by sequential hydrothermal carbonization and sulfonation of xylose. The morphology and textural properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy and N<inf>2</inf> sorption measurements, respectively. The presence of sulfonic acid on the surface was proven by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Meanwhile, the acid properties were studied using an NH<inf>3</inf>-TPD profile. Two different sulfonated carbons that was activated with KOH before sulfonation and one that was compared. The KOH-activated sulfonated carbon contained both a porous structure and a high sulfonic acid content that improved the furfural yield and selectivity by more than 50% compared to the nonactivated sulfonated carbon. The reusability of the catalyst was investigated by monitoring the furfural selectivity over several reaction cycles, and after the 3rd cycle, a reduction in the selectivity from 72 to 30% was observed. However, the acid-functionalized carbon could still be useful for furfural production due to its low environmental impact in both the preparation and disposal steps. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1455–1461, 2018. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Furfural; Hydrothermal; Porous Carbon; Sulfonated Carbon; Xylose Dehydration; Aldehydes; Carbon; Carbonization; Environmental Impact; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Furfural; Porous Materials; Potassium Hydroxide; Reusability; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Sulfonation; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Both Fourier Transform Infrared; Environmentally Benign; Hydrothermal; Hydrothermal Carbonization; Porous Carbons; Porous Structures; Textural Properties; Xylose Dehydrations; Catalyst Selectivity","Aldehydes; Carbon; Carbonization; Environmental impact; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Furfural; Porous materials; Potassium hydroxide; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Sulfonation; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Both Fourier Transform Infrared; Environmentally benign; Hydrothermal; Hydrothermal carbonization; Porous carbons; Porous structures; Textural properties; Xylose dehydrations; Catalyst selectivity","","","This work was supported by The Thailand Research Fund; and the Faculty of Science and Technology Research Fund (Contract No. 8/2559), Thammasat University.

We have found that an upright NO adsorbed at a short-bridge site and a side-on NO at a hollow site connecting two short-bridge sites are the two most stable molecularly adsorbed states, and the latter is the precursor for the dissociation process. Various NO dissociation pathways under the influences of the hydrogen bonds with water have been investigated. We have found that hydrogen bonds efficiently reduce the activation energy of NO dissociation by the introductions of a water dimer to O and water dimers to both sides of the side-on NO, respectively. More importantly, the promoting effect of water molecules on NO dissociation is dominant only when one of water molecules in a water dimer forms a hydrogen bond with O of the side-on NO. Our results provide a physical insight into the promoting effect of hydrogen bonds with water, which may be helpful in improving the catalytic activity as well as designing novel catalysts for NO reduction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activation Energy; Catalyst Activity; Copper Compounds; Density Functional Theory; Dimers; Dissociation; Molecules; Nitric Oxide; Adsorbed State; Dissociation Process; No Dissociation; Novel Catalysts; Oxide Dissociation; Promoting Effect; Short Bridges; Water Molecule; Hydrogen Bonds","Activation energy; Catalyst activity; Copper compounds; Density functional theory; Dimers; Dissociation; Molecules; Nitric oxide; Adsorbed state; Dissociation process; NO dissociation; Novel catalysts; Oxide dissociation; Promoting effect; Short bridges; Water molecule; Hydrogen bonds","","","We thank Professors Hiroshi Okuyama and Akitoshi Shiotari for valuable discussions.

The proposed method is an improvement of the Cuckoo search algorithm by employing a new strategy to focus Cuckoo eggs on the global optima. Cuckoo eggs have to learn and modify themselves to enhance their performance. The learning strategy of Cuckoo eggs is also controlled by a learning factor to prevent the search engine falling into local optima. The proposed method is applied for solving optimal power flow problems to figure the effectiveness out. The aim of the problem is to determine the minimized fuel cost while satisfying equal and unequal operating constraints of elements. The proposed SLCSA is also evaluated the problem on three IEEE 57-, 118- and 300-bus systems.

However, the synergistic effects of anion–cation double substitution for overall enhancement of the catalytic activity remains questionable. Here, the simultaneous incorporation of vanadium and phosphorus into the CoS<inf>2</inf> moiety for preparing 3D mesoporous cubic pyrite-metal Co<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>V<inf>x</inf>SP is presented. It is demonstrated that the higher catalytic activity of CoS<inf>2</inf> after V incorporation can be primarily attributed to abundance active sites, whereas P substitution is responsible for improving HER kinetics and intrinsic catalyst. Interestingly, due to the synergistic effect of P–V double substitution, the 3D Co<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>V<inf>x</inf>SP shows superior electrocatalysis toward the HER with a very small overpotential of 55 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec−1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.45 H<inf>2</inf> s−1 at 10 mA cm−2, which is very close to commercial 20% Pt/C. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the superior catalytic activity of the 3D Co<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>V<inf>x</inf>SP is contributed by the reduced kinetic energy barrier of rate-determining HER step as well as the promotion of the desorption H<inf>2</inf> gas process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Codoping; Electrocatalysts; Hydrogen Evolution Reaction; Synergistic Effect; Vanadium-cobalt Phosphosulphide; Catalysis; Cobalt Compounds; Crystal Structure; Density Functional Theory; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Kinetic Energy; Kinetics; Positive Ions; Pyrites; Transition Metals; Vanadium Compounds; Cation Substitutions; Co-doping; Double Substitution; Hydrogen Evolution Reactions; Structure Materials; Synergistic Effect; Transition Metal Dichalcogenides; Turnover Frequency; Catalyst Activity","Catalysis; Cobalt compounds; Crystal structure; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Positive ions; Pyrites; Transition metals; Vanadium compounds; Cation substitutions; Co-doping; Double substitution; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Structure materials; Synergistic effect; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Turnover frequency; Catalyst activity","","","This work was supported by IBS-R011-D1.

In Southeast Asia, many non-edible oils are used to produce BDFs, as exemplified by the recent use of the non-edible oil derived from Vernicia montana Lour. in Laos and Vietnam for the production of BDF. In this work, we developed an improved procedure for the production of BDF from Vernicia montana oil consisting of 80.3%±0.5% α-eleostearic acid moiety (C18:3) using a co-solvent method. Furthermore, the stability of the BDF was evaluated based on its iodine value and unsaturated ester content. The optimized production conditions were determined to be as follows: methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, 1% (wt/wt) KOH, 20% (wt/wt) acetone as a co-solvent, and a reaction temperature of 40°C. Under these conditions, we achieved a BDF conversion efficiency of 99%±0.3% within 30 min of initiating the transesterification process. Notably, the BDF produced from Vernicia montana oil showed good stability to air at temperatures ≤30°C for 1 month, showing similar stability properties to the BDF produced from rapeseed oil. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiesel Production; Co-solvent Method; Iodine Value; Low Energy Consumption; Vernicia Montana Lour.

In order to measure that current, a wide bandwidth sensor accompanied with high-speed amplifiers are required. Furthermore, a high Analog-to-Digital sampling rate is also necessary for sampling and processing the measured data. To avoid those expensive requirements, this paper proposes an alternative control method for the DAB converter. In the proposed method, the terminal current is estimated by a reduced-order proportional integral observer. A technique is also proposed to reduce the phase drift effect when the voltages at two terminals are not matched. Afterwards, a combined current feedforward-voltage feedback control system is developed to enhance the system dynamics and to regulate the output voltage. This control system needs only the information of the terminal voltages and no current sensor is required.

Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO<inf>2</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and NO<inf>x</inf> from the power generation system. A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO<inf>2</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and NO<inf>x</inf> are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem. The obtained results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of QPSO to solve many-objective EED problems. This also shows that QPSO can effectively be implemented in such power dispatch problems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cubic Criterion Function; Economic Load Dispatch; Emission Reduction; Environmental Economic Dispatch; Many-objective Optimization; Max/max Penalty Factor; Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization; Carbon Dioxide; Emission Control; Nitrogen Oxides; Particle Swarm Optimization (pso); Scheduling; Simulated Annealing; Criterion Functions; Economic Load Dispatch; Emission Reduction; Environmental Economics; Many-objective Optimizations; Penalty Factor; Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization; Electric Load Dispatching","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling; Simulated annealing; Criterion functions; Economic load dispatch; Emission reduction; Environmental economics; Many-objective optimizations; Penalty factor; Quantum particle swarm optimization; Electric load dispatching","","","Funding text 1: Centre of Graduate Studies of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Department of Fundamental & Applied Sciences of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of Ministry of Education (MOE) Malaysia, Grant/Award Number: 0153AB‐K45; Funding text 2: This research paper is supported by Centre of Graduate Studies of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Department of Fundamental & Applied Sciences of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of Ministry of Education (MOE) Malaysia (0153ABK45).","Wang, Bo, Supply reliability and generation cost analysis due to load forecast uncertainty in unit commitment problems, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 28, 3, pp. 2242-2252, (2013); Doherty, Ronan, Frequency control in competitive electricity market dispatch, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 20, 3, pp. 1588-1596, (2005); Bai, J., A probabilistic reserve market incorporating interruptible load, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 21, 3, pp. 1079-1087, (2006); Ei-Keib, A.

We proposed a tourism model for the regional promotion of footpaths as the main axis in the ""Agri-culture System"" designated as part of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Applying a Contingent Valuation Method, we asked walkers how much they were willing to contribute to various GIAHS-related activities through volunteering in addition to the participation fee for the walk. We hypothesized that the diverse means and activities to support conservation would contribute to sustainable management of GIAHS. The research findings showed that walkers had options to choose which activity to support. For track maintenance, WTCL in volunteering is 4.23 days a year. In the case of walkers who had no options, their Willingness to Contribute in Labor (WTCL) by volunteering is 3.34 days a year. To link the regional resources used for tourism with GIAHS require their effective management and conservation. Thus, it is desirable to formulate a combined approach such as payments by users of the trails and contributions through volunteer activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contingent Valuation Method; Footpath; Giahs; Long Trail; Stated Preference; Sustainable Rural Management; Volunteering; Willingness To Contribute In Labor; Contingent Valuation; Development Strategy; Ecotourism; Labor; Maintenance; Management Practice; Model; Public Goods; Regional Development; Road; Voluntary Approach; Walking","contingent valuation; development strategy; ecotourism; labor; maintenance; management practice; model; public goods; regional development; road; voluntary approach; walking","","","This research is supported by an Oita Prefecture GIAHS research grant of 2016.

The results found four quality management practices that have significantly positive impact on sustainability performance: top management support for quality management, design for quality, quality data and reporting, and continuous improvement. These practices could be considered as critical quality management factors that significantly contribute to sustainability goals.

The stem mortality rate was 0.9% year–1 and the stem recruitment rate was 2.2% year–1. Annual ΔAGB was 10.8 Mg ha–1 year–1, equaling to 5.4 Mg C ha–1 year–1. Of which, tree stems of 35–80 cm DBH classes accounted for 65%. The results indicated that the forest is in stage of carbon sequestration. Any disturbances causing death of 35–80 cm DBH tree stems will much reduce carbon sequestration capacity and it will take a long time for AGB to return to pre-disturbance stage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Sequestration; Mortality Rate; Recruitment Rate; Southeast Asian; Stem Size; Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Population Statistics; Aboveground Biomass Increments; Biomass Accumulation; Carbon Sequestration; Diameter-at-breast Heights; Evergreen Broad-leaved Forests; Mortality Rate; Recruitment Rates; Southeast Asian; Forestry; Aboveground Biomass; Broad-leaved Forest; Carbon Sequestration; Evergreen Forest; Mortality; Recruitment (population Dynamics); Stand Dynamics; Stem; Basal Area; Chelation; Forests; Mortality; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Population statistics; Aboveground biomass increments; Biomass accumulation; Carbon sequestration; Diameter-at-breast heights; Evergreen broad-leaved forests; Mortality rate; Recruitment rates; Southeast Asian; Forestry; aboveground biomass; broad-leaved forest; carbon sequestration; evergreen forest; mortality; recruitment (population dynamics); stand dynamics; stem; Basal Area; Chelation; Forests; Mortality; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 106-NN.06-2016.10.","Achard, Frédéric, Determination of deforestation rates of the world's humid tropical forests, Science, 297, 5583, pp. 999-1002, (2002); Adachi, Minako, Carbon budget of tropical forests in Southeast Asia and the effects of deforestation: An approach using a process-based model and field measurements, Biogeosciences, 8, 9, pp. 2635-2647, (2011); Baker, Timothy R., Increasing biomass in Amazonian forest plots, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 359, 1443, pp. 353-365, (2004); Sci Technol J Agric Rural Dev, (2009); Bonan, Gordon B., Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests, Science, 320, 5882, pp. 1444-1449, (2008); Brown, Irving Foster, Uncertainty in the biomass of Amazonian forests: An example from Rondônia, Brazil, Forest Ecology and Management, 75, 1-3, pp. 175-189, (1995); Brown, Sandra L., Measuring carbon in forests: Current status and future challenges, Environmental Pollution, 116, 3, pp. 363-372, (2002); Long Term Impacts of Logging Intensity on Forest Structure and Stand Dynamics of Tropical Evergreen Broad Leaved Forest in Kon Ha Nung Central Highlands of Vietnam, (2015); Chave, Jérôme, Estimation of biomass in a neotropical forest of French Guiana: Spatial and temporal variability, Journal of Tropical Ecology, 17, 1, pp. 79-96, (2001); Clark, Deborah A., Measuring net primary production in forests: Concepts and field methods, Ecological Applications, 11, 2, pp. 356-370, (2001)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","1540756X; 10549811","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030150899"

In addition to inter-bedded shale and sand sequences in the overburden, there is an overpressured stratum immediately below and above the normally-pressured and highly fractured sandstones and volcanic rocks at the target depth. During the drilling of offset wells, multiple tight spots were experienced in the overburden. An inflow was detected in the volcanic rocks, and consequently the mud weight was increased in the deeper section of overpressured zone. Further, severe mud losses occurred in the underlying normally-pressured and highly fractured sandstones, and eventually stuck pipe was experienced. This study shows the development of a field-wide geomechanical model that is able to match all the drilling experiences in the offset wells. A geomechanical model was developed for the field in which in-situ stresses and rock mechanical properties were calibrated with field data and lab measurements. The model predicted different types of borehole failures such as breakouts and drilling-induced fractures that contributed to different types of wellbore instability events in existing wells. Analysis showed that drilling with a significantly high overbalance pressure in the fractured zone increased the risk of tool string differential sticking and stuck pipe. To investigate the root causes of dynamic mud losses in the fractured intervals with major intersecting faults, a Mohr-Coulomb friction sliding criterion was applied. The analysis showed that the majority of natural fractures and faults, which are oriented in the north-east and south-west (NE-SW) direction, are critically stressed and may become conduits for drilling fluid and cause mud losses. The geomechanical model was used to design a mud weight program for an upcoming well. This program was optimized to mitigate the issues experienced during drilling of the offset wells. The results of this study led to an optimized mud program to minimize shale breakouts in the overburden, control the risk of kicks in the overpressured zone, and reduce the risk of mud losses in the fractured formation. Additionally, an optimized casing program and the use of lower mud weight were recommended, with the addition of loss circulation material (LCM), to drill a highly deviated wellbore within the fractured formation. The drilling campaign of the planned well was successful with good drilling practices such as equivalent circulating density (ECD) control, good hole cleaning and use of the recommended mud weight programs and optimised drilling fluids suggested by this study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drilling Fluids; Fracture; Geologic Models; Geomechanics; Infill Drilling; Offshore Oil Well Production; Offshore Technology; Oil Field Equipment; Risk Assessment; Sandstone; Shale; Volcanic Rocks; Volcanoes; Differential Sticking; Equivalent Circulating Density; Extended Reach Drilling; Fractured Formations; Fractured Sandstones; Geomechanical Model; Naturally-fractured Formations; Wellbore Instability; Boreholes","Drilling fluids; Fracture; Geologic models; Geomechanics; Infill drilling; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Oil field equipment; Risk assessment; Sandstone; Shale; Volcanic rocks; Volcanoes; Differential sticking; Equivalent circulating density; Extended reach drilling; Fractured formations; Fractured sandstones; Geomechanical model; Naturally-fractured formations; Wellbore instability; Boreholes","","","","Asadi, Mohammad Sadegh, Challenges in defining fracture gradient for highly deviated wells in the presence of natural fractures in deepwater environments, 3, pp. 2092-2102, (2014); Asadi, Mohammad Sadegh, Comprehensive geomechanical modeling and wellbore stability analysis for infill drilling of high-angled wells in a mature oil field, (2016); Fjaer, Erling, Petroleum related rock mechanics, (1992); Gfz Data Services, (2016); Horsrud, Per, Estimating mechanical properties of shale from empirical correlations, SPE Drilling and Completion, 16, 2, pp. 68-73, (2001); Lee, Gwang-hoon, Geologic evolution of the Cuu Long and Nam Con Son basins, offshore Southern Vietnam, South China Sea, AAPG Bulletin, 85, 6, pp. 1055-1082, (2001); McNally, G.

This is due to the fact that NEP of a forest is the amount of carbon accumulated in a unit of area and time. This chapter discusses NEP in tropical broad-leaved forests of the Copia Natural Reserve, northwest Vietnam and the need for a carbon certificate to support the local community. Based on field research in northwest Vietnam, this chapter proposes a modified and easily applicable method for estimating NEP. Research results indicate that one hectare of secondary broad-leaved forest in Vietnam can accumulate 6.57 Mg C y−1, more than twice that of old-growth forest at 2.57 Mg C y−1. Research suggests that NEP is higher than some other forests around the world. We suggest that a price should minimally sustain the livelihood of forest protectors, at around 10 US$/ton carbon, a price much higher than current government payments of 10 US$ ha y−1, regardless of carbon accumulation. This chapter asserts the importance of issuing forest carbon certificate to forest protectors so that local communities can raise their bargaining power to improve their income while at the same time, protect the natural forests sustainably. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Market; Carbon Sequestration; Poverty Reduction; Southeast Asia; Tropical Forests","","","","Acknowledgments This research was funded by Vietnamese National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), under grant number 106-NN.06-2016.10.","Adachi, Minako, Carbon budget of tropical forests in Southeast Asia and the effects of deforestation: An approach using a process-based model and field measurements, Biogeosciences, 8, 9, pp. 2635-2647, (2011); Baishya, Ratul, Estimation of tree biomass, carbon pool and net primary production of an old-growth Pinus kesiya Royle ex.

Here, we present a platinum nanoparticle (NPs)-decorated one-dimensional (1D) titanium dioxide nanorod (PtNPs/TiO<inf>2</inf>NRs) nanocomposite with enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The TiO<inf>2</inf>NRs were prepared through a green approach, utilizing seaweed extract that not only acts as a reducing agent but also serves as a soft template for the directional growth of TiO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures. PtNPs of about 3.0 nm average size were decorated over pre-synthesized TiO<inf>2</inf>NRs through the chemical reduction of Pt ions using sodium borohydride. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy analyses confirmed the presence of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) in the prepared hybrid nanocomposite. The as-prepared PtNPs/TiO<inf>2</inf>NRs composite nanostructures exhibited significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance and stability towards the ORR, with specific and mass activities of 0.428 mA cm−2 at 0.55 V and 128 mA mg−1 Pt, respectively. These values are 7.2 and 3.5 fold higher than that of standard Pt/C catalysts (0.059 mA cm−2 and 36 mA mg−1 Pt), respectively. The enhanced catalytic activity and high stability of the composite catalyst are mainly due to the unique 1D morphology of the TiO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures, which provides a greater surface area, and the SMSI enhancing electron transfer rate at their functional interface. The green approach utilized to fabricate the Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf>NRs composite in the present study provides a new, low-cost strategy for the development of metal-oxide hybrid nanostructures of high electrocatalytic activity for fuel cell applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst Activity; Cathodes; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic Reduction; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Nanorods; Oxygen; Platinum Compounds; Platinum Metals; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Sodium Borohydride; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium Dioxide; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Composite Nanostructures; Electrocatalytic Activity; Electrocatalytic Performance; Enhanced Catalytic Activity; Oxygen Reduction Reaction; Platinum Nano-particles; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (pemfcs); Strong Metal Support Interaction; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (pemfc)","Catalyst activity; Cathodes; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Nanorods; Oxygen; Platinum compounds; Platinum metals; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium Borohydride; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium dioxide; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Composite nanostructures; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrocatalytic performance; Enhanced catalytic activity; Oxygen reduction reaction; Platinum nano-particles; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Strong metal support interaction; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)","","","SKK acknowledges CONACyT, Mexico, for offering the Cathedra position (Project No. 649).

Some 40 new WWTPs are in the design or construction phase with a capacity of 1,600,000 m3/day. During operation, a lot of excess sludge must be wasted out of the system. It is well recognized that sludge disposal is one of the most critical issues for WWTPs as the cost of the excess sludge treatment and disposal can account for 50–60% of the operating cost. In Vietnam, sludge discharged from wastewater treatment plants were mostly disposed by the conventional method such as landfill. Therefore, reduction of sludge volume before disposal is very important for sludge transportation and management. In this study, the sludge was disintegrated by alkalis to enhance the sludge biodegradability before adding to the anaerobic digestion. As a result, MLSS reduced from 6600 mg/L down to about 4800 mg/L when alkalis dosage was increased from 1 to 1.8 g/L. Soluble COD was increased from less than 100 mg/L to over 1800 mg/L. The sludge biodegradability enhancement is linearly correlated to COD solubilization. The biogas production of the disintegrated sludge was higher compared to the sludge without the alkali disintegration (358 and 245 mL biogas/g sludge added), representing a 46% increase in the biogas production. The cost of chemical consumption for sludge disintegration was about 0.36 US $/kg TSS. The alkali sludge disintegration combined with anaerobic digestion process could be considered as a potential approach for sludge management of wastewater treatment plants in Vietnam. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic Digestion; Biodegradability; Biogas Production; Disintegration; Techno-economic; Waste Activated Sludge; Wastewater; Activated Sludge Process; Anaerobic Digestion; Biodegradability; Biogas; Disintegration; Reclamation; Sewage Pumping Plants; Sewage Treatment Plants; Sludge Disposal; Wastewater; Wastewater Disposal; Wastewater Treatment; Water Treatment Plants; Alkali Disintegration; Anaerobic Digestion Process; Biogas Production; Sludge Biodegradabilities; Techno-economic Assessment; Techno-economics; Waste Activated Sludges; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Sludge Digestion","Activated sludge process; Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradability; Biogas; Disintegration; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge disposal; Wastewater; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Alkali disintegration; Anaerobic digestion process; Biogas production; Sludge biodegradabilities; Techno-economic assessment; Techno-economics; Waste activated sludges; Wastewater treatment plants; Sludge digestion","","","","Akbulut, Abdullah, Techno-economic analysis of electricity and heat generation from farm-scale biogas plant: Çiçekdaĝi{dotless} case study, Energy, 44, 1, pp. 381-390, (2012); Amha, Yamrot M., Elucidating microbial community adaptation to anaerobic co-digestion of fats, oils, and grease and food waste, Water Research, 123, pp. 277-289, (2017); Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (1995); Appels, Lise, Principles and potential of the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge, Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 34, 6, pp. 755-781, (2008); Appels, Lise, Influence of microwave pre-treatment on sludge solubilization and pilot scale semi-continuous anaerobic digestion, Bioresource Technology, 128, pp. 598-603, (2013); De Aquino, Sérgio Francisco, Assessment of ozone as a pretreatment to improve anaerobic digestion of vinasse, Brazilian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 33, 2, pp. 279-285, (2016); Atay, Şeyma, Classification and Effects of Sludge Disintegration Technologies Integrated Into Sludge Handling Units: An Overview, Clean - Soil, Air, Water, 44, 9, pp. 1198-1213, (2016); Baêta, B.

The synthesis of mesoporous Pt/CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures involves two steps. First, mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures were synthesized via macroalgae polymer mediated approach and followed by supporting of PtNPs of ca. 5-10 nm over the mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures using seed-mediated chemical reduction process. The structural and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies confirm the strong coupling between PtNPs and the mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> support resulting in the generation of more oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the enhanced charge transport at their functional interface. Significantly, the synthesized mesoporous Pt/CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures were found to show enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ethanol electrooxidation reaction. The enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of both mesoporous structure and the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the resultant Pt/CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures. Our facile and eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of mesoporous CeO<inf>2</inf> nanostructures that supports PtNPs with an excellent catalytic activity is validated as a promising strategy for potential applications in fuel cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cerium Oxide; Electrocatalysis; Ethanol Electrooxidation; Platinum Nanoparticles; Red Algae; Algae; Catalyst Activity; Catalytic Oxidation; Cerium; Cerium Oxide; Chemical Bonds; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrooxidation; Ethanol; Fuel Cells; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Ionic Liquids; Mesoporous Materials; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Oxides; Oxygen Vacancies; Platinum; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; X Ray Scattering; Catalytic Performance; Electrocatalytic Activity; Ethanol Electro-oxidation; Ethanol Electrooxidation Reactions; Mesoporous Structures; Platinum Nano-particles; Red Algae; Spectroscopic Characterization; Cerium Compounds","Algae; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Cerium; Cerium oxide; Chemical bonds; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrooxidation; Ethanol; Fuel cells; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ionic liquids; Mesoporous materials; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Oxides; Oxygen vacancies; Platinum; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray scattering; Catalytic performance; Electrocatalytic activity; Ethanol electro-oxidation; Ethanol electrooxidation reactions; Mesoporous structures; Platinum nano-particles; Red algae; Spectroscopic characterization; Cerium compounds","","","","Chueh, William C., High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes, Nature Materials, 11, 2, pp. 155-161, (2012); Shao, Minhua, Recent Advances in Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction, Chemical Reviews, 116, 6, pp. 3594-3657, (2016); Shang, Zeyu, Core-shell"" nanostructured supported size-selective catalysts with high catalytic activity, Nano Letters, 17, 1, pp. 104-109, (2017); Malgras, Victor, Nanoarchitectures for Mesoporous Metals, Advanced Materials, 28, 6, pp. 993-1010, (2016); Stephens, Ifan E.L., Understanding the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction on platinum and its alloys, Energy and Environmental Science, 5, 5, pp. 6744-6762, (2012); Mistry, Hemma, Nanostructured electrocatalysts with tunable activity and selectivity, Nature Reviews Materials, 1, (2016); Banham, Dustin William H., Current status and future development of catalyst materials and catalyst layers for proton exchange membrane fuel cells: An industrial perspective, ACS Energy Letters, 2, 3, pp. 629-638, (2017); Ferreira, Paulo J., Instability of Pt/C electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells: A mechanistic investigation, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 152, 11, pp. A2256-A2271, (2005); Greeley, Jeffrey P., Alloys of platinum and early transition metals as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts, Nature Chemistry, 1, 7, pp. 552-556, (2009); Xia, Younan, Toward cost-effective and sustainable use of precious metals in heterogeneous catalysts, Accounts of Chemical Research, 50, 3, pp. 450-454, (2017)","","American Chemical Society service@acs.org","","","","","","21680485","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042368543"

The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of oncoming turbulence on the flutter of suspended long-span bridges using a section model wind-tunnel test. Several wind-tunnel tests were performed on a truss bridge deck section with different oncoming turbulent properties involving reduced turbulence intensities and turbulent scales. This study includes an investigation of the effect of oncoming flows on modal dynamic responses. The transient and buffeting response data from the wind-tunnel test are analyzed using the system identification technique in extracting FDs, and the difficulties involved in this method are discussed. The time-domain SSI is applied to extract all FDs simultaneously from one and two degree-of-freedom (1DOF and 2DOF) systems.

For low power applications, boost PFC converters operated in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) or boundary conduction mode (BCM) mode are usually employed. The main advantage of BCM mode is the reduction of reversal recovery loss of diode and simple control, especially at the high-line light-load condition. In this paper, a digital-controlled method for boost PFC operating under boundary conduction mode without input voltage sensing is proposed. The digital PI controller voltage is used to determine the constant on-time period and the comparator block inside the DSP controller is employed to detect the zero-crossing of inductor current for turning on the main switch. Therefore, the size and cost are reduced significantly. A 200W boost PFC prototype is implemented and tested to verify the feasibility of the proposed control scheme. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boundary Conduction Mode; Digital Controller; Pi Controller; Power Factor Correction Converter; Controllers; Dc-dc Converters; Electric Power Factor Correction; Boundary Conduction Mode; Design And Implementations; Digital Controllers; Discontinuous Conduction Mode; Inductor Currents; Low Power Application; Pi Controller; Power Factor Correction Converters; Power Converters","Controllers; DC-DC converters; Electric power factor correction; Boundary conduction mode; Design and implementations; Digital controllers; Discontinuous conduction mode; Inductor currents; Low power application; PI Controller; Power factor correction converters; Power converters","","","This project is sponsored by Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan: MOST 105-2221-E-011-164.","Zhang, Wangfeng, A digital power factor correction (PFC) control strategy optimized for DSP, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 19, 6, pp. 1474-1485, (2004); Lai, Jihsheng Sheng Jason, Design consideration for power factor correction boost converter operating at the boundary of continuous conduction mode and discontinuous conduction mode, Conference Proceedings - IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC, pp. 267-273, (1993); Kim, Jong-woo, A digitally controlled critical mode boost power factor corrector with optimized additional on time and reduced circulating losses, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 30, 6, pp. 3447-3456, (2015); Lai, Yenshin Shin, A family of predictive digital-controlled PFC under boundary current mode control, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 3, pp. 448-458, (2012); Choi, Byungcho, Modeling and small-signal analysis of controlled on-time boost power-factor-correction circuit, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 48, 1, pp. 136-142, (2001); Jovanović, Milan M., State-of-the-art, single-phase, active power-factor-correction techniques for high-power applications - An overview, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 52, 3, pp. 701-708, (2005); Digital Self Tuning Controllers, (2005)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd IEEE International Future Energy Electronics Conference and ECCE Asia, IFEEC - ECCE Asia 2017","","Kaohsiung","129571","","9781509051571","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034089298"

In order to cope with these problems, the control strategy of PV units where both reactive power control and active power curtailment are allowed has been proposed and it seems quite effective. However, much more active power curtailment is required to satisfy control requirement and this is not desired by customers on account that they will lose revenue. Besides, network configuration through sectionalizing switches is not really efficient with regard to intermittent power output of PVs and load variation throughout the day. Hence, this paper proposes a new control strategy which is the combination of dynamic-switch based load transfer (LT) and optimal inverter dispatch (OID) of PV units to eliminate VU while minimizing PVs' active power curtailment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Load Transfer; Photovoltaic (pv) Power Systems; Power Distribution; Voltage Unbalance; Customer Satisfaction; Photovoltaic Cells; Power Control; Reactive Power; Load Transfer; Network Configuration; Photovoltaic Power Systems; Photovoltaic Systems; Power Distributions; Residential Power Systems; Sectionalizing Switch; Voltage Unbalances; Electric Load Dispatching","Customer satisfaction; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Reactive power; Load transfer; Network configuration; Photovoltaic power systems; Photovoltaic systems; Power distributions; Residential power systems; Sectionalizing switch; Voltage unbalances; Electric load dispatching","","","","Canova, Aldo, Electrical impact of photovoltaic plant in distributed network, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 45, 1, pp. 341-347, (2009); International Journal of Electrical Computer Energetic Electronic and Communication Engineering, (2016); Tonkoski, Reinaldo, Impact of high PV penetration on voltage profiles in residential neighborhoods, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 3, 3, pp. 518-527, (2012); Shahnia, Farhad, Voltage imbalance analysis in residential low voltage distribution networks with rooftop PVs, Electric Power Systems Research, 81, 9, pp. 1805-1814, (2011); Shahnia, Farhad, Predicting voltage unbalance impacts of plug-in electric vehicles penetration in residential low-voltage distribution networks, Electric Power Components and Systems, 41, 16, pp. 1594-1616, (2013); Shahnia, Farhad, Voltage unbalance improvement in low voltage residential feeders with rooftop PVs using custom power devices, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 55, pp. 362-377, (2014); Su, Xiangjing, Optimal PV inverter reactive power control and real power curtailment to improve performance of unbalanced four-wire LV distribution networks, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 3, pp. 967-977, (2014); Dall’Anese, Emiliano, Optimal dispatch of photovoltaic inverters in residential distribution systems, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 2, pp. 487-497, (2014); Turitsyn, Konstantin S., Options for control of reactive power by distributed photovoltaic generators, Proceedings of the IEEE, 99, 6, pp. 1063-1073, (2011); Ghasemi, Mojtaba, Multi-objective optimal power flow considering the cost, emission, voltage deviation and power losses using multi-objective modified imperialist competitive algorithm, Energy, 78, pp. 276-289, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 IEEE Manchester PowerTech, Powertech 2017","","Manchester","129343","","9781509042371","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034759341"

However, very few of them have targeted the distribution network operations in Japan. One of the operation methods used to maintain the supply-demand balance at the distribution network level is conservation voltage reduction (CVR), which is an operation method for reducing the active power consumption of the load demands by decreasing the sending end voltage at the distribution substation. Although CVR is a conventional operation method, it has gained much attention in the recent years owing to the emergence of smart meters. In this study, we focus on the applicability of CVR to Japanese distribution networks with large PV generations. First, we analyze the active power consumptions of the load demands and the transmission losses, by changing the sending end voltage at the substation and considering various load characteristics. Then, we evaluate the impact of the decrease in PV power output on the total active power consumption in the distribution network. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conservation Voltage Reduction (cvr); Distribution Network; Load Characteristic; Photovoltaic (pv) Generation; Electric Power Distribution; Electric Substations; Renewable Energy Resources; Active Power; Conservation Voltage Reduction; Conservation Voltage Reductions; Integration Of Renewable Energies; Load Characteristics; Load Demand; Operation Methods; Photovoltaics Generations; Power; Supply/demand Balance; Electric Power Utilization","Electric power distribution; Electric substations; Renewable energy resources; Active power; Conservation voltage reduction; Conservation voltage reductions; Integration of renewable energies; Load characteristics; Load demand; Operation methods; Photovoltaics generations; Power; Supply/demand balance; Electric power utilization","","","This work was partly supported by the Daiko Foundation (1-1-22, Daikou-minami, Higashi-ku, Nagoya 461-0047, Japan), Power Academy (1-3-2 Ootemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8118, Japan), and Meijo Asian Research Center (1-501 Shiogamaguchi, Tempaku-ku, Nagoya 468-8502, Japan).","Present Status and Promotion Measures for the Introduction of Renewable Energy in Japan; National Survey Report of Pv Power Applications in Japan 2007, (2008); Masuta, Taisuke, Impact of forecast error of photovoltaic power output on demand and supply operation in power systems, (2014); Ikeda, Yuichi, A unit commitment model with demand response for the integration of renewable energies, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, (2012); International Conference on Electrical Engineering, (2016); Masuta, Taisuke, Supplementary load frequency control by use of a number of both electric vehicles and heat pump water heaters, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 3, pp. 1253-1262, (2012); Fazelpour, Farivar, Intelligent optimization to integrate a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle smart parking lot with renewable energy resources and enhance grid characteristics, Energy Conversion and Management, 77, pp. 250-261, (2014); Brunner, Marc, PV curtailment reduction with smart homes and heat pumps, (2016); Evaluation of Conservation Voltage Reduction Cvr on A National Level, (2010); Bokhari, Abdullah, Combined Effect of CVR and DG Penetration in the Voltage Profile of Low-Voltage Secondary Distribution Networks, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 31, 1, pp. 286-293, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Lanka Electric Company (LECO) Pvt.

A large part of the offshore wind resource is however located in deep water, where floating wind turbines can harvest more energy. This paper describes a systematic experiment and a simulation analysis (FAST code) about the cyclic pitch control of blades. This work was performed to investigate performance fluctuation of a floating wind turbine utilizing cyclic pitch control. The experiment was carried out in an open wind tunnel with mainstream wind velocity of 10 m/s with the front inflow wind and the oblique inflow wind conditions. A model wind turbine is two-bladed downwind wind turbine with diameter of 1.6 m. Moment and force acts on the model wind turbine were measured by a six-component balance. Fluctuation of power coefficient and thrust coefficient was investigated in the cyclic pitch control. The model wind turbine and the experimental conditions were simulated by FAST code. The comparison of the experimental data and the simulation results of FAST code show that the power coefficient and thrust coefficient are in good agreement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamic Forces; Cyclic Pitch Control; Fast Code; Floating Offshore Wind Turbine; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Aerodynamics; Codes (symbols); Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Offshore Wind Turbines; Aerodynamic Forces; Cyclic Pitch; Cyclic Pitch Control; Fast Code; Floating Offshore Wind Turbines; Floating Wind Turbines; Performance; Pitch-control; Power Coefficients; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Wind Tunnels","Aerodynamics; Codes (symbols); Horizontal axis wind turbine; Offshore wind turbines; Aerodynamic forces; Cyclic pitch; Cyclic pitch control; FAST code; Floating offshore wind turbines; Floating wind turbines; Performance; Pitch-control; Power coefficients; Wind tunnel experiment; Wind tunnels","","","","Frau, Edoardo, Comparison of performance and unsteady loads of multimegawatt downwind and upwind turbines, Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, 137, 4, (2015); Fukushima Floating Offshore Wind Farm Demonstration Project Fukushima Forward, (2013); Fukushima Floating Offshore Wind Farm Demonstration Project Fukushima Forward Construction of Phase I Pamphlet, (2014); Gebraad, Pieter M.O., Wind plant power optimization through yaw control using a parametric model for wake effects - A CFD simulation study, Wind Energy, 19, 1, pp. 95-114, (2016); Global Wind Report Annual Market Update 2010, (2011); Aerodynamics of Wind Turbines, (2000); ASME Wind Energy Symposium, (2006); Fast User S Guide, (2005); Kragh, Knud Abildgaard, Potential of power gain with improved yaw alignment, Wind Energy, 18, 6, pp. 979-989, (2015); Proceedings of Ewec2010, (2010)","","Diponegoro university Indonesia - Center of Biomass and Renewable Energy (CBIORE)","","","","","","22524940","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068157401"

Thus, PV curtailment will occasionally be required in future power systems that contain extremely large integrations of PV generation. The curtailed power is determined to maintain the supply-demand balance in the entire power system. However, a technique to curtail the powers of many PV systems located in different areas has not been discussed yet. In this study, we propose and evaluate a PV-curtailment method that uses an optimal power flow (OPF) with the transmission-network constraints, which considers the locations of all PV systems. Simulation results show that the PV systems selected for curtailment and the amount of power to be curtailed have a significant impact on the total curtailed PV energy and total transmission loss. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Optimal Power Flow (opf); Photovoltaic (pv) Generation; Power System; Pv Curtailment; Unit Commitment (uc); Acoustic Generators; Electric Load Flow; Electric Power Transmission; Photovoltaic Cells; Smart Power Grids; Optimal Power Flows; Photovoltaic Generation; Power System; Pv Curtailment; Unit Commitment; Electric Power Transmission Networks","Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Photovoltaic cells; Smart power grids; Optimal power flows; Photovoltaic generation; power system; PV curtailment; Unit Commitment; Electric power transmission networks","","","This work was partly supported by JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR15K1 (5, Sanbancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0075, Japan) and Meijo Asian Research Center (1-501 Shiogamaguchi, Tempaku-ku, Nagoya 468-8502, Japan).","Dall’Anese, Emiliano, Optimal dispatch of photovoltaic inverters in residential distribution systems, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 2, pp. 487-497, (2014); Ghosh, Shibani, Local distribution voltage control by reactive power injection from PV inverters enhanced with active power curtailment, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2014-October, October, (2014); Ghosh, Shibani, Distribution Voltage Regulation Through Active Power Curtailment With PV Inverters and Solar Generation Forecasts, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 8, 1, pp. 13-22, (2017); Brunner, Marc, PV curtailment reduction with smart homes and heat pumps, (2016); Su, Xiangjing, Optimal PV inverter reactive power control and real power curtailment to improve performance of unbalanced four-wire LV distribution networks, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 3, pp. 967-977, (2014); von Appen, Jan, Local voltage control strategies for PV storage systems in distribution grids, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 5, 2, pp. 1002-1009, (2014); Olivier, Frédéric, Active Management of Low-Voltage Networks for Mitigating Overvoltages Due to Photovoltaic Units, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 7, 2, pp. 926-936, (2016); Dall’Anese, Emiliano, Photovoltaic Inverter Controllers Seeking AC Optimal Power Flow Solutions, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 31, 4, pp. 2809-2823, (2016); Guggilam, Swaroop S., Scalable Optimization Methods for Distribution Networks with High PV Integration, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 7, 4, pp. 2061-2070, (2016); Present Status and Promotion Measures for the Introduction of Renewable Energy in Japan","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe, ISGT-Europe 2017","","Torino","134292","","9781538619537","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046291771"

This paper focuses on the assessment of the proposed green strategies in the master plan. Firstly, numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting were conducted for the present land use condition as well as the condition proposed by the master plan under the same extremely hot summer conditions of June 2010. Secondly, the results of the master plan condition were further compared with other scenarios comprising different green strategies for assessing their cooling effects. Based on the results, the daytime peak air temperature in the master plan condition was projected to maintain almost the same level as the current condition. However, the high temperature areas with temperature of 40–41 °C, would expand widely over the planned built-up areas. Further results showed that the green strategies were not necessarily effective at cooling all of the built-up areas, though these strategies largely reduced the air temperature within the green spaces, particularly at night. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Cities; Future Urbanisation; Master Plan; Urban Heat Island; Weather Research And Forecasting; Atmospheric Temperature; Landforms; Population Statistics; Weather Forecasting; Developing Cities; Future Urbanisation; Master Plan; Urban Heat Island; Weather Research And Forecasting; Land Use","Atmospheric temperature; Landforms; Population statistics; Weather forecasting; Developing cities; Future urbanisation; Master plan; Urban heat island; Weather research and forecasting; Land use","","","","Adachi, Sachiho A., Comparison of the impact of global climate changes and urbanization on summertime future climate in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 51, 8, pp. 1441-1454, (2012); Adachi, Sachiho A., Moderation of summertime heat island phenomena via modification of the Urban form in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 53, 8, pp. 1886-1900, (2014); Aflaki, Ardalan, Urban heat island mitigation strategies: A state-of-the-art review on Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong, Cities, 62, pp. 131-145, (2017); Alexander, Paul John, Simulating the impact of urban development pathways on the local climate: A scenario-based analysis in the greater Dublin region, Ireland, Landscape and Urban Planning, 152, pp. 72-89, (2016); Argüeso, Daniel, Temperature response to future urbanization and climate change, Climate Dynamics, 42, 7-8, pp. 2183-2199, (2014); Bowler, Diana E., Urban greening to cool towns and cities: A systematic review of the empirical evidence, Landscape and Urban Planning, 97, 3, pp. 147-155, (2010); Cao, Xin, Quantifying the cool island intensity of urban parks using ASTER and IKONOS data, Landscape and Urban Planning, 96, 4, pp. 224-231, (2010); Chang, Chiru, Effects of urban parks on the local urban thermal environment, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 13, 4, pp. 672-681, (2014); Chen, Xiaoling, Remote sensing image-based analysis of the relationship between urban heat island and land use/cover changes, Remote Sensing of Environment, 104, 2, pp. 133-146, (2006); Chen, Ailian, Effect of urban green patterns on surface urban cool islands and its seasonal variations, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 13, 4, pp. 646-654, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22106707","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017583562"

The crystalline homogeneity of a sample was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction and the superconducting properties so that vortices are easily able to move for accommodating vortices in the geometric symmetry of the star-shaped plate. The experimental vortex configurations obtained for a star-shaped plate are in good agreement with theoretical predictions from the nonlinear Ginzburg–Landau equation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorphous Moge Film; Geometric Confinement; Squid Microscope; Vortex State; Amorphous Films; Finite Element Method; Germanium Compounds; Molluscs; Nonlinear Equations; Numerical Methods; Plasma Theory; Shellfish; Stars; X Ray Diffraction; Geometric Confinement; Numerical Calculation; Scanning Squid Microscope; Squid Microscopes; Superconducting Properties; Vortex Configurations; Vortex Distribution; Vortex State; Vortex Flow","Amorphous films; Finite element method; Germanium compounds; Molluscs; Nonlinear equations; Numerical methods; Plasma theory; Shellfish; Stars; X ray diffraction; Geometric confinement; Numerical calculation; Scanning SQUID microscope; SQUID microscopes; Superconducting properties; Vortex configurations; Vortex distribution; Vortex state; Vortex flow","","","","Sov Phys JETP, (1957); Kokubo, Nobuhito, Scanning SQUID microscope study of vortex polygons and shells in weak-pinning disks of an amorphous superconducting film, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 82, 1, (2010); Cabral, Leonardo R.E., Vortex configurations in thin superconducting equilateral triangles, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 80, 21, (2009); Physica C, (2019); Nature, (2000); Pereira, Paulo J., Vortex matter in mesoscopic two-gap superconductor square, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 84, 14, (2011); Baelus, Ben J., Dependence of the vortex configuration on the geometry of mesoscopic flat samples, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 65, 10, pp. 1-12, (2002); Pearl, Judea, Current distribution in superconducting films carrying quantized fluxoids, Applied Physics Letters, 5, 4, pp. 65-66, (1964); Morooka, Toshimitsu, Development of scanning SQUID microscope for studying superconducting films and devices, Physica C: Superconductivity and its Applications, 335, 1, pp. 157-163, (2000); Plourde, Britton L.T., Vortex distributions near surface steps observed by scanning SQUID microscopy, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 66, 5, pp. 545291-545299, (2002)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09214534","","PHYCE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84998817146"

A single Li atom is fired with an initial kinetic energy level (0.2 or 2.0 eV) and various targeting factors x, which determines the collision angle. After getting trapped, Li is observed to bounce elastically and glide on the MoS<inf>2</inf> surface thanks to the ""breathing"" vibration of MoS<inf>2</inf>. Both firing energy and targeting factor x are shown to have a significant effect on the trapping and gliding processes. It is found that a higher value of targeting factor x (≥0.6) and initial firing energy (2.0 eV) enhances Li migration on the MoS<inf>2</inf> surface. Also, analysis from electronic structure calculations of six representative Li-MoS<inf>2</inf> interacting configurations suggests that there is ionic interaction and partial charge transfer between the absorbed Li atom and MoS<inf>2</inf> monolayer during the bouncing and migration process.

At first, air resistances acting on a hull and an accommodation of the ship are investigated by a commercial Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code. Then, CFD results are compared with those of experimental results to validate the accuracy of the CFD. Secondly, air resistances acting on the ship with an accommodation on its deck are computed to obtain air resistances acting on the whole ships, on the hull and on accommodation. The results demonstrate that the interaction effects between the hull and its accommodation house be also shown how to reduce the total air resistance by using interaction effects between the hull and an accommodation house. The results can be applied in reducing the total resistances acting on a ship. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accommodation House; Air Resistance; Cfd; Hull; Interaction Effects; Saving Energy","","","","","Journal of the Kansan Society of Naval Architects, (2003); Proc 4th Asia Pacific Workshop on Marine Hydrodynamics Aphydro 08, (2008); Fujiwara, Toshifumi, Experimental investigation and estimation on wind forces for a container ship, Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, pp. 555-562, (2009); Proceedings of the 5th Asia Pacific Workshop on Marine Hydrodynamics Aphydro2010, (2010); Proceedings of the 16th Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineering, (2013); Proceedings of the 16th Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineering, (2013); Proceedings of the 18th Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineering, (2014); Practical Used Guideline for Ship Cfd Application, (2011); Application of Cfd to Optimization of Hydrodynamic Performances of Nonballast Ships Ph D Thesis, (2013)","","ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network","","","","","","25869159","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073567467"

A main reason is that private investors must deal with critical risks concerning PPP investment environment. It is a challenging task for the government to optimally manage such risks to enhance the attractiveness of PPP projects for private investors. This paper examines the critical risk factors that influence the private sector's investment decisions on PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Risk factors inherent in typical PPP projects were compiled by comprehensive literature review. To reflect unique characteristics of PPP projects in Vietnam, the compiled risk factors were reviewed by a group of PPP experts from both the public and private sectors in Vietnam through in-depth interviews and questionnaire surveys. In addition, ten PPP project case studies in Vietnam were analyzed to derive the risk profile of PPP transportation projects of the nation. These risk factors were quantitatively assessed based on their probabilities and impact levels. We found that the critical risk factors of PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam are acquisition/compensation problems, approvals and permits, inadequate feasibility studies, finance market issues, subjective evaluation methods, and change in laws and regulations. By performing factor analysis, these critical risk factors were grouped into four categories: (1) bidding process, (2) finance issues, (3) laws and regulations, and (4) project evaluation issues. These critical risk factors represent the obstacles that repel private investors from PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Thus, the Vietnam government agencies should meticulously address these issues to attract both domestic and foreign private investors in PPP projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors would like to thank the ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net), Chulalongkorn University, Kyoto University, and Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology for their financial support to this paper.","Public Private Partnership in Infrastructure Development Case Studies from Asia and Europe, (2009); Nguyen, Longduy, Large construction projects in developing countries: A case study from Vietnam, International Journal of Project Management, 22, 7, pp. 553-561, (2004); Thomas, Anu V., Modelling and assessment of critical risks in BOT road projects, Construction Management and Economics, 24, 4, pp. 407-424, (2006); Li, Bing, Critical success factors for PPP/PFI projects in the UK construction industry, Construction Management and Economics, 23, 5, pp. 459-471, (2005); Revival of Private Participation in Developing Country Infrastructure A Look at Recent Trends and Policy Implications, (2007); Flyvbjerg, Bent, Underestimating costs in public works projects: Error or lie?, Journal of the American Planning Association, 68, 3, pp. 279-295, (2002); Public Private Partnerships in Infrastructure Best Practices from International Experience and Applications for Thailand, (2008); Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Jabnoun, Naceur, Measuring perceived service quality at UAE commercial banks, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 20, 4, pp. 458-472, (2003); Analysis of the Malaysian Toll Road Public Private Partnership Program and Recommendations for Policy Improvements, (2005)","","ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network","","","","","","25869159","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073551609"

Using pneumatic cylinders with different sizes, an experimental setup is built to measure friction force-displacement characteristics in presliding regime under various conditions of pressures in the cylinder chambers. A new mathematical model of friction for the pneumatic cylinders is proposed by incorporating a hysteresis function into the new modified LuGre model. The experimental results show that when the pressures are varied, friction of the pneumatic cylinders in pre-sliding regime is represented by behavior of a nonlinear spring. In addition, hysteresis behavior with nonlocal memory is obtained in the friction force-displacement characteristics and that the size of the hysteresis loop is increased with increasing pressures in the cylinder chambers. The simulation results show that the new friction model can accurately simulate the friction behavior of the pneumatic cylinders in pre-sliding regime as well as sliding regime. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fluid Power Actuator; Friction Behavior; Friction Model; Pneumatic Cylinder; Pre-sliding","","","","This research was funded by Collaborative Research Program for Alumni Members (CRA), AUN/SEED-Net, JICA under grant numbers HUST CRA 1401 and HUST CRA 1501.","Hibi, Akira, MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE TORQUE CHARACTERISTICS FOR HYDRAULIC MOTORS., Bulletin of the JSME, 20, 143, pp. 616-621, (1977); Schroeder, Lee E., Experimental study of friction in a pneumatic actuator at constant velocity, Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control, 115, 3, pp. 575-577, (1993); Belforte, Guido, Measurement of Friction Force in Pneumatic Cylinders, Tribo Test, 10, 1, pp. 33-48, (2003); Abcm Symposium Series in Mechatronics, (2006); Nouri, Bashir M.Y., Friction identification in mechatronic systems, ISA Transactions, 43, 2, pp. 205-216, (2004); Yanada, Hideki, Modeling of dynamic behaviors of friction, Mechatronics, 18, 7, pp. 330-339, (2008); Canudas-de-Wit, Carlos, A New Model for Control of Systems with Friction, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 40, 3, pp. 419-425, (1995); Trans Jpn Fluid Power Syst Soc, (2010); Tran, Xuan Bo, Modeling of dynamic friction behaviors of hydraulic cylinders, Mechatronics, 22, 1, pp. 65-75, (2012); Intelligent Control and Automation, (2013)","","ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network","","","","","","25869159","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073504137"

Based on a questionnaire survey in Vietnam, the most concern factors of private investors are their own capacity, demand issues, legal and political risks, long-term income, and financial sources issues of the PPP project. Moreover, five factors that represent the significant differences between the private and public sectors including political risks, enhancement of company's strength in its industry, construction risks, demand issues, and financial viability of the company are also discovered.

The main objective of the plan is to demonstrate safe and reliable electricity and process heat generation from a nuclear reactor. The RDE is a very small sized pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) with low enriched uranium (LEU) UO<inf>2</inf> TRISO fuel. Following our previous design study with multipass fueling scheme, a scoping study on fuel composition parameters, namely heavy metal (HM) loading per pebble and uranium enrichment was conducted for the simpler once-through-then-out (OTTO) fueling scheme. No need of burnup measurement devices and refueling mechanism to send back discharged fuel pebbles into the core, low power and power density, and simple operation of the RDE become strongest motivation for the present work. The objective function for the optimization is the fissile loading requirement per energy generated (kg/GWd). The optimal heavy metal loading was found around 8 g/pebble while the uranium enrichment corresponding to the 80 GWd/t discharge burnup constraint is approximately 13.7 w/o. Compared with the burnup calculations results of multipass fueling scheme, OTTO fueling scheme burnup performance is slightly inferior in that slightly higher enrichment and fissile loading per pebble are required to achieved the same average discharge burnup. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Htgr; Indonesian Experimental Power Reactor (rde); Multipass; Otto; Pebble-bed Reactor; Uranium Fuel Cycle; Fueling; Fuels; Gas Cooled Reactors; Heavy Metals; High Temperature Gas Reactors; Nuclear Energy; Nuclear Fuels; Nuclear Power Plants; Nuclear Reactors; Pebble Bed Reactors; Uranium; Uranium Compounds; Uranium Dioxide; Htgr; Multi-pass; Otto; Power Reactor; Uranium Fuels; Loading","Fueling; Fuels; Gas cooled reactors; Heavy metals; High temperature gas reactors; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Pebble bed reactors; Uranium; Uranium compounds; Uranium dioxide; HTGR; Multi-pass; OTTO; Power reactor; Uranium fuels; Loading","","","","User Requirement Document Reaktor Daya Eksperimental, (2014); Analysis of the Optimal Fuel Composition for the Indonesian Experimental Power Reactor 10 Mwth Pebble Bed Htgr, (2016); Xu, Yuanhui, Overview of the 10 MW high temperature gas cooled reactor - Test module project, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 218, 1-3, pp. 13-23, (2002); Liem, Peng Hong, BATAN-MPASS: A general fuel management code for pebble-bed high-temperature reactors, Annals of Nuclear Energy, 21, 5, pp. 281-290, (1994); Terry, William K., Direct deterministic method for neutronics analysis and computation of asymptotic burnup distribution in a recirculating pebble-bed reactor, Annals of Nuclear Energy, 29, 11, pp. 1345-1364, (2002); V S O P Computer Code System for Reactor Physics and Fuel Cycle Simulation, (1994); Gerwin, H., TREATMENT OF THE UPPER CAVITY IN A PEBBLE-BED HIGH-TEMPERATURE GAS COOLED REACTOR BY DIFFUSION THEORY., Nuclear Science and Engineering, 97, l, pp. 9-l9, (1987); Liem, Peng Hong, Neutronic and thermal hydraulic design of the graphite moderated helium-cooled high flux reactor, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 139, 2, pp. 221-233, (1993)","Obara, T.; Kato, Y.; Sato, I.; Hayashizaki, N.; Kikura, H.; Matsumoto, Y.; Tsukahara, T.; Yoshida, K.; Kobayashi, Y.; Sagara, H.; Chiba, S.","Elsevier Ltd","","5th International Symposium on Innovative Nuclear Energy Systems, INES-5 2016","","Tokyo; Tokyo Institute of Technology","139408","18766102","9781627483179; 9781627484299; 9781629935683; 9781409423836; 9781627484404; 9781627484312; 9781627484275; 9781409423829; 9781627484305","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042034957"

For deep water areas, FOWTs (Floating Offshore Wind Turbines) are sensitive to large oscillations due to the aerodynamic force of wind and the hydrodynamic force of wave. In the natural environment, the wind is usually unstable and characterized by the diagonal inflow wind. In this study, the potential of alleviating blade load variations induced by the cyclic pitch control evaluated under the condition of the diagonal inflow wind. An experiment in an open wind tunnel was performed to investigate the effect of the diagonal inflow wind on the aerodynamic forces of FOWTs. A two-bladed downwind FOWT with a diameter of 1.6 m used for this experiment. The forces and moments applied to the entire wind turbine were measured by a six-component balance. A swash plate used to adjust the pitch angle in the cyclic pitch control. From the experimental results, the average value of the aerodynamic load acting on the rotor face in the diagonal inflow wind condition at phase angle of ξ = 60° equals the moment coefficient in the optimum operating condition at the front inflow wind. The load change on yaw system can be controlled by cyclic pitch control method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerodynamic Forces; Cyclic Pitch Control; Floating Offshore Wind Turbine; Six-component Balance; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Aerodynamics; Turbine Components; Wind Power; Wind Tunnels; Wind Turbines; Aerodynamic Forces; Cyclic Pitch; Experimental Investigations; Floating Offshore Wind Turbines; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines; Off-shore Wind Power; Optimum Operating Conditions; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Offshore Wind Turbines; Aerodynamics; Deep Water; Experimental Study; Hydrodynamic Force; Inflow; Offshore Structure; Wave Runup; Wind Power; Wind Tunnel; Wind Turbine","Aerodynamics; Turbine components; Wind power; Wind tunnels; Wind turbines; Aerodynamic forces; Cyclic pitch; Experimental investigations; Floating offshore wind turbines; Horizontal axis wind turbines; Off-shore wind power; Optimum operating conditions; Wind tunnel experiment; Offshore wind turbines; aerodynamics; deep water; experimental study; hydrodynamic force; inflow; offshore structure; wave runup; wind power; wind tunnel; wind turbine","","","","Topham, Eva, Sustainable decommissioning of an offshore wind farm, Renewable Energy, 102, pp. 470-480, (2017); Li, Qing'an A., Effect of rotor aspect ratio and solidity on a straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine in three-dimensional analysis by the panel method, Energy, 121, pp. 1-9, (2017); Sarker, Bhaba Ranjan, Minimizing transportation and installation costs for turbines in offshore wind farms, Renewable Energy, 101, pp. 667-679, (2017); Perveen, Rehana, Off-shore wind farm development: Present status and challenges, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 29, pp. 780-792, (2014); Músial, Walt David, Energy from offshore wind, 3, pp. 1888-1898, (2006); Shikha, Aspects of technological development of wind turbines, Journal of Energy Engineering, 129, 3, pp. 81-95, (2003); Liu, Yichao, Developments in semi-submersible floating foundations supporting wind turbines: A comprehensive review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 60, pp. 433-449, (2016); Global Wind Report Annual Market Update 2013, (2025); Tran, Thanh Toan, The platform pitching motion of floating offshore wind turbine: A preliminary unsteady aerodynamic analysis, Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 142, pp. 65-81, (2015); Salehyar, Sara, Aerodynamic dissipation effects on the rotating blades of floating wind turbines, Renewable Energy, 78, pp. 119-127, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03605442; 18736785","0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808","ENEYD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020466896"

In the construction industry, several empirical investigations have examined the influence of culture on project management. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of project organizational culture on the performance of construction projects. A total of 199 completed construction projects in Vietnam with specific data gathering through questionnaires were analyzed. The findings reveal that contractor commitment to contract agreements is the most significant cultural factor affecting project performance. Goal alignment and reliance, contractor commitment, and worker orientation (i.e., commitment to workers) contribute to improved overall performance and participant satisfaction. Contractor commitment and cooperative orientation enhance labor productivity, whereas goal alignment and trust and contractor commitment ensure learning performance (i.e., learning from experience). The findings of this study may assist construction professionals in implementing practices that can contribute to the sustainability and success of construction projects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultural Influence; Performance; Project Management; Project Organizational Culture; Project Performance; Sustainability; Academic Research; Construction Industry; Labor Productivity; Learning; Project Design; Project Management; Questionnaire Survey; Sustainability; Viet Nam","academic research; construction industry; labor productivity; learning; project design; project management; questionnaire survey; sustainability; Viet Nam","","","","Ibrahim, Abdul Razak Bin, An investigation of the status of the Malaysian construction industry, Benchmarking, 17, 2, pp. 294-308, (2010); J Adv Perform Inf Value, (2012); J Adv Perform Inf Value, (2014); Xiong, Bo, Examining the influence of participant performance factors on contractor satisfaction: A structural equation model, International Journal of Project Management, 32, 3, pp. 482-491, (2014); Chan, Albert P.C., Factors affecting the success of a construction project, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 130, 1, pp. 153-155, (2004); Fortune, Joyce, Framing of project critical success factors by a systems model, International Journal of Project Management, 24, 1, pp. 53-65, (2006); Acta Structilia, (2012); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2014); Sanvido, Victor E., Critical success factors for construction projects, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 118, 1, pp. 94-111, (1992); Belout, Adnane, Effects of human resource management on project effectiveness and success: Toward a new conceptual framework, International Journal of Project Management, 16, 1, pp. 21-26, (1998)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019143101"

In this study, SBK was derived from the saponification and dercarboxylation of coconut oil, and consists predominantly of n-paraffins with carbon chain lengths from C7 to C17. Dodecane, butylcyclohexane and butylbenzene were chosen as surrogate components for n-paraffins in SBK, cycloparaffins and aromatics, respectively. The total soot volume was measured from the light extinction at ambient conditions in a wick-fed laminar diffusion flame. The measured smoke point of the fuel was correlated with the required sooting tendency according to the jet fuel standard. The freezing point was measured using the JIS K2276 test method. The results show that butylcyclohexane affects the sooting tendency much lesser than butylbenzene when blended with SBK or dodecane. In contrast, butylcyclohexane decreases the freezing point more, as compared to butylbenzene, when blended with dodecane. Butylcyclohexane and butylbenzene have a similar trend of effect on the freezing point when blended with SBK or dodecane. Blending SBK or dodecane with butylcyclohexane matches the requirements of both smoke point and freezing point for jet fuel specified by ASTM D1655. Conversely, blending SBK or dodecane with butylbenzene does not meet these requirements. Therefore, given the tradeoff between sooting tendency and freezing point, cycloparaffins are considered more promising than aromatics for blending with SBK or n-paraffin fuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aromatics; Cycloparaffins; Freezing Point; Normal Paraffins; Soap-derived Biokerosene; Sooting Tendency; Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Blending; Carbon; Fuels; Jet Fuel; Light Extinction; Paraffins; Testing; Ambient Conditions; Aromatics; Carbon-chain Length; Cycloparaffins; Experimental Investigations; Freezing Point; Laminar Diffusion Flames; Sooting Tendency; Freezing","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Blending; Carbon; Fuels; Jet fuel; Light extinction; Paraffins; Testing; Ambient conditions; Aromatics; Carbon-chain length; Cycloparaffins; Experimental investigations; Freezing point; Laminar diffusion flames; Sooting tendency; Freezing","","","We gratefully acknowledge the ASEAN University Network Southeast Asian Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net) project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for financial support.

The electro-hydrodynamic behavior of air-flow has been experimentally and numerically studied. The velocity of ion wind reaches values up to 1.25 m/s using low discharge current 5 μA with the kinetic conversion efficiency of 0.65% and the released net charge of −30 fA, 8 orders of magnitude smaller compared with the discharge current. Due to easy scalability and low net charge, the present configuration is beneficial to applications with space constraints and/or where neutralized discharge process is required, such as inertial fluidic units, circulatory flow heat transfer, electrospun polymer nanofiber to overcome the intrinsically instability of the process, or the formation of low charged aerosol. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Simulation; Bipolar Corona Discharge; Electrohydrodynamics; Ion Wind; Neutralization; Openfoam; Air; Electric Corona; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; Heat Transfer; Ions; Negative Ions; Parallel Flow; 3d Simulations; Corona Discharges; Ion Wind; Neutralization; Openfoam; Electric Discharges","Air; Electric corona; Electrodes; Electrohydrodynamics; Heat transfer; Ions; Negative ions; Parallel flow; 3D simulations; Corona discharges; Ion wind; Neutralization; OpenFOAM; Electric discharges","","","","Philos Mag, (1899); Aiee Trans, (1961); Leal Ferreira, Guilherme Fontes, Point-to-plane corona: Current-voltage characteristics for positive and negative polarity with evidence of an electronic component, Journal of Applied Physics, 59, 9, pp. 3045-3049, (1986); Moreau, Éric, Enhancing the mechanical efficiency of electric wind in corona discharges, Journal of Electrostatics, 66, 1-2, pp. 39-44, (2008); Kawamoto, Hiroyuki, Electrostatic micro-ozone fan that utilizes ionic wind induced in pin-to-plate corona discharge system, Journal of Electrostatics, 66, 7-8, pp. 445-454, (2008); Go, David B., Ionic winds for locally enhanced cooling, Journal of Applied Physics, 102, 5, (2007); Kim, Chul, Microscopic energy conversion process in the ion drift region of electrohydrodynamic flow, Applied Physics Letters, 100, 24, (2012); Shin, Dong Ho, Experimental optimization of ion wind generator with needle to parallel plates for cooling device, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 84, pp. 35-45, (2015); Chen, Ingyoung, Enhanced cooling for LED lighting using ionic wind, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 57, 1, pp. 285-291, (2013); Toyota, Hiroyuki, Gaseous electrical discharge characteristics in air and nitrogen at cryogenic temperature, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 9, 6, pp. 891-898, (2002)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","08941777","","ETFSE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976892389"

Our study focuses on vortex states in small star-shaped Mo<inf>80</inf>Ge<inf>20</inf> plates with and without an artificial pin at the plate center. Vortex states are greatly influenced by the sample geometry, the temperature and the magnetic field, and they can be occasionally exotic compared to the bulk case.

We applied scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy because it enables us to see vortex states directly and it is the most sensitive instrument for mapping tiny local current flows or magnetic moments without damaging the sample. We interpreted that vortex configurations had essentially the nature of mirror reflection symmetry in both cases with an artificial pin and without an artificial pin and pinned cases while the influence of disorder was seen in our observation on the specimen without an artificial pin. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorphous Mo80ge20 Film; Artificial Pinning Center; Squid Microscopy; Vortex States; Amorphous Films; Flux Pinning; Germanium; Magnetic Moments; Molluscs; Quantum Interference Devices; Quantum Theory; Shellfish; Squids; Artificial Pinning Centers; Mirror Reflections; Sensitive Instruments; Squid Microscopy; Vortex Configurations; Vortex Distribution; Vortex State; Vortices In Superconductors; Vortex Flow","Amorphous films; Flux pinning; Germanium; Magnetic moments; Molluscs; Quantum interference devices; Quantum theory; Shellfish; SQUIDs; Artificial pinning centers; Mirror reflections; Sensitive instruments; SQUID microscopy; Vortex configurations; Vortex distribution; Vortex state; Vortices in superconductors; Vortex flow","","","This work was partly supported by a Grant-in-Aid for challenging Exploratory Research (No. 25600018 , No. 15K13979 ) from JSPS , a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (No. 26820130 and No. 26800192 ) from JSPS , and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) (No. 23226019 ) from JSPS .","Sov Phys JETP, (1957); Baelus, Ben J., Vortex shells in mesoscopic superconducting disks, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 69, 6, (2004); Grigorieva, Irina V., Direct observation of vortex shells and magic numbers in mesoscopic superconducting disks, Physical Review Letters, 96, 7, (2006); Cabral, Leonardo R.E., Vortex configurations in thin superconducting equilateral triangles, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 80, 21, (2009); Zhao, Haijun, Vortex configurations in mesoscopic superconducting triangles: Finite-size and shape effects, Europhysics Letters, 83, 1, (2008); Chibotaru, Liviu F., Symmetry-induced formation of antivortices in mesoscopic superconductors, Nature, 408, 6814, pp. 833-835, (2000); Zhao, Haijun, Vortex states in mesoscopic superconducting squares: Formation of vortex shells, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 78, 10, (2008); Baelus, Ben J., Dependence of the vortex configuration on the geometry of mesoscopic flat samples, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 65, 10, pp. 1045151-10451512, (2002); Huy, Ho Thanh, Vortex imaging in amorphous Mo80Ge20 pentagons, Physica C: Superconductivity and its Applications, 494, pp. 99-101, (2013); Huy, Ho Thanh, Vortex states in de facto mesoscopic Mo80Ge20 pentagon plates, Superconductor Science and Technology, 26, 6, (2013)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09214534","","PHYCE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979503395"

Our analysis of inundation patterns projects that the duration of inundation at an important road in the city will continue to rise from the current total of 72 inundated days per year to 270 days by 2030 and 365 days by 2050. This is attributed to the combined influence of sea-level rise and land subsidence, which causes relative water level rises at a rate of 22.3 mm·yr-1. People in the Mekong Delta have traditionally lived with floods, and thus there is certain resilience among residents in coping with small floods. At present, daily maximum inundation depth, which is generally shallower than 10 cm on the road, seems to be still manageable; however, our analysis indicates that this will start drastically increasing in the coming decades and reach an average depth of 70 cm by 2050. Effective and well-planned actions to mitigate the effects of land subsidence and sea-level rise are urgently required, otherwise, local inhabitants will encounter an unmanageable increase in inundation depth and duration in the coming decades. This study, which considers both sea-level rise and land subsidence, suggests that inundation depth and duration are projected to rise much faster than those indicated by previous studies, which only consider sea-level rise. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flood; Land Subsidence; Mekong Delta; River Discharge; Sea-level Rise (slr); Tide; Action Plan; Disaster Management; Flood; Ocean Tide; River Discharge; Sea Level Change; Subsidence; Can Tho; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","action plan; disaster management; flood; ocean tide; river discharge; sea level change; subsidence; Can Tho; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","","Greater Mekong and Climate Change Biodiversity Ecosystem Services and Development at Risk, (2009); Bull Faculty Sci Univ Ryukyus, (2007); Impact of Sea Level Rise on Developing Countries A Comparative Analysis, (2007); Wassmann, Reiner, Sea level rise affecting the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Water elevation in the flood season and implications for rice production, Climatic Change, 66, 1-2, pp. 89-107, (2004); Rapid Assessment of the Extent and Impact of Sea Level Rise in Viet Nam, (2008); Nerem, R.

This work describes the design and implementation of an assistance system for a personal mobility vehicle using the concept of personal space (PS), and clarifies the influence of the PMV equipped with the assistance system on surrounding pedestrians. The proposed assistance system detects nearby pedestrians and notifies the driver the invasion of the PMV. The experiment was conducted under different conditions of pedestrian density, and questionnaires were used to evaluate the feelings of PMV drivers and pedestrians such as discomfort and fear. The experimental results showed that the assistance system for the PMV was very effective at low pedestrian densities. The discomfort levels of pedestrians and drivers, when the PMV was equipped with the assistance system, were lower than those for the case of the PMV without assistance system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assistance System; Experimental Evaluation; Pedestrians; Personal Mobility Vehicle; Personal Space","","","","","Proceedings of 13th Asia Pacific Vibration Conference, (2025); Sawatzky, Bonita J., The Segway Personal Transporter as an Alternative Mobility Device for People With Disabilities: A Pilot Study, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 88, 11, pp. 1423-1428, (2007); Ulrich, Karl T., Estimating the technology frontier for personal electric vehicles, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 13, 5-6, pp. 448-462, (2005); Yoopt Your Personal Transporter; Leader in Personal Green Transportation; Butler, John Travis, Psychological effects of behavior patterns of a mobile personal robot, Autonomous Robots, 10, 2, pp. 185-202, (2001); Walters, Michael L., The influence of subjects' personality traits on personal spatial zones in a human-robot interaction experiment, 2005, pp. 347-352, (2005); Nakagawa, Chihiro, Evaluation of personal space for pedestrians encountering personal mobility vehicles, (2013); First International Symposium on Future Active Safety Technology Toward Zero Traffic Accident, (2011); Nakagawa, Chihiro, Influence of the size of a personal mobility vehicle on the affinity with a pedestrian, 1, pp. 795-802, (2012)","","American Scientific Publishers","","","","","","19366612; 19367317","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989167881"

Significant plasmon damping is observed for titanium layer thicknesses up to t<inf>Ti</inf> = 5 nm, which cannot be fully explained by simulation models that account for the overlap of the electric field in the bimetal layer with the titanium layer. Furthermore, the relationship between the SERS enhancement factor and the LSPR quality-factor G Q4 breaks down as t<inf>Ti</inf> is increased beyond 1 nm. We attribute the LSPR and SERS suppression to plasmon damping and spectral broadening of interband absorption due to the field overlap with the titanium layer and titanium impurities that interdiffuse through the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline gold layer during the deposition of the Au-Ti bimetal.

Hence, if the hydrate conditions are well addressed, it is possible overcome hydrate-related problems. To that end, evolving an accurate and simple-to-apply approach for estimating gas hydrate formation is vitally important. In this contribution, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) approach has been developed based on Katz chart data points to estimate natural gas hydrate formation temperature as function of the pressure and gas gravity. In addition, a genetic algorithm has been employed to optimize hyper parameters of the LSSVM. Moreover, the present model has been compared with five popular correlations and was concluded that the LSSVM approach has fewer deviations than these correlations so to estimate hydrate formation temperature. According to statistical analyses, the obtained values of MSE and R2 were 0.278634 and 0.9973, respectively. This predictive tool is simple to apply and has great potential for estimating natural gas hydrate formation temperature and can be of immense value for engineers who deal with the natural gas utilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Correlation; Ga, Hydrate; Lssvm; Natural Gas; Temperature; Chemical Plants; Correlation Methods; Gas Plants; Gases; Genetic Algorithms; Hydration; Natural Gas; Natural Gas Well Production; Support Vector Machines; Temperature; Hydrate Formation; Hydrate Formation Temperatures; Least Square Support Vector Machines; Lssvm; Natural Gas Utility; Natural-gas Production; Phase Equilibriums; Predictive Tools; Gas Hydrates","Chemical plants; Correlation methods; Gas plants; Gases; Genetic algorithms; Hydration; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Support vector machines; Temperature; Hydrate formation; Hydrate formation temperatures; Least square support vector machines; LSSVM; Natural gas utility; Natural-gas production; Phase equilibriums; Predictive tools; Gas hydrates","","","","Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Evolving simple-to-apply models for estimating thermal conductivity of supercritical CO2, International Journal of Ambient Energy, 38, 3, pp. 300-307, (2017); Amedi, Hamid Reza, Evolving machine learning models to predict hydrogen sulfide solubility in the presence of various ionic liquids, Journal of Molecular Liquids, 216, pp. 411-422, (2016); Baghban, Alireza, Phase equilibrium modeling of semi-clathrate hydrates of seven commonly gases in the presence of TBAB ionic liquid promoter based on a low parameter connectionist technique, Journal of Supercritical Fluids, 101, pp. 184-192, (2015); Baghban, Alireza, Prediction carbon dioxide solubility in presence of various ionic liquids using computational intelligence approaches, Journal of Supercritical Fluids, 98, pp. 50-64, (2015); Baghban, Alireza, Estimation of air dew point temperature using computational intelligence schemes, Applied Thermal Engineering, 93, pp. 1043-1052, (2016); Bahadori, Alireza, Estimation of emission of hydrocarbons and filling losses in storage containers using intelligent models, Petroleum Science and Technology, 34, 2, pp. 145-152, (2016); Bahadori, Alireza, Computational intelligent strategies to predict energy conservation benefits in excess air controlled gas-fired systems, Applied Thermal Engineering, 102, pp. 432-446, (2016); Bahadori, Alireza, A novel correlation for estimation of hydrate forming condition of natural gases, Journal of Natural Gas Chemistry, 18, 4, pp. 453-457, (2009); Berge, Bent K., Hydrate predictions on a microcomputer, pp. 213-219, (1986); Carroll, John J., Acid gas injection: Another approach of acid gas treatment, Natural Gas Industry, 29, 10, pp. 96-100, (2009)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","15322459; 10916466","","PSTEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987638075"

In this study, engineering properties of lightweight geopolymer-based material produced from the ternary blend of red mud (RM) waste, rice husk ash (RHA) and diatomaceous earth (DE) are optimized with statistical multi-response surface method. Using the augmented simplex lattice mixture design, ten mix proportions of RM, RHA and DE were prepared and mixed with 15 % (by weight of the solid) water glass solution to produce the specimens. After 28 days of curing at room temperature, these specimens were tested for compressive strength (MPa), volumetric weight (kg/m3), and water absorption (kg/m3) including the mass loss (%), volumetric shrinkage (%) and change in compressive strength (%) when subjected to an elevated temperature of 1000 °C. By using the desirability function approach on multiple responses, the optimum ternary blend was found to be 14.5 % RM, 67.2 % RHA and 18.3 % DE to obtain the desirable engineering properties of a lightweight heat resistant material. Using this mix proportion, confirmatory runs were also done and the experimental values were found to be in good agreement with the predicted values. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Desirability Function; Diatomaceous Earth; Geopolymer; Multiple Response Surface Method; Red Mud; Rice Husk Ash; Compressive Strength; Environmental Impact; Geopolymers; Pozzolan; Silicates; Surface Analysis; Surface Properties; Water Absorption; Desirability Function; Diatomaceous Earth; Geopolymer; Multiple Response; Red Mud; Rice Husk Ash; Inorganic Polymers","Compressive strength; Environmental impact; Geopolymers; Pozzolan; Silicates; Surface analysis; Surface properties; Water absorption; Desirability function; Diatomaceous earth; Geopolymer; Multiple response; Red mud; Rice husk ash; Inorganic polymers","","","","Bentur, Arnon, Cementitious materials-Nine millennia and a new century: Past, present, and future, Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 14, 1, pp. 2-22, (2002); Worrell, Ernst, Industrial energy efficiency and climate change mitigation, Energy Efficiency, 2, 2, pp. 109-123, (2009); Hasanbeigi, Ali, Energy efficiency improvement and CO2 emission reduction opportunities in the cement industry in China, Energy Policy, 57, pp. 287-297, (2013); Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies 6th International Conference, (2003); Shi, Caijun, New cements for the 21st century: The pursuit of an alternative to Portland cement, Cement and Concrete Research, 41, 7, pp. 750-763, (2011); Ogunkunle, Clement Oluseye, Pollution loads and the ecological risk assessment of soil heavy metals around a mega cement factory in southwest Nigeria, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies, 22, 2, pp. 487-493, (2013); Worrell, Ernst, Potentials for energy efficiency improvement in the US cement industry, Energy, 25, 12, pp. 1189-1214, (2000); Phair, John William, Green chemistry for sustainable cement production and use, Green Chemistry, 8, 9, pp. 763-780, (2006); Nielsen, Claus Vestergaard, Danish experiences with a decade of green concrete, Journal of Advanced Concrete Technology, 5, 1, pp. 3-12, (2007); Juenger, Maria C.Garci, Advances in alternative cementitious binders, Cement and Concrete Research, 41, 12, pp. 1232-1243, (2011)","","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","18772641; 1877265X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982693885"

Implementing concentration of surfactant through surfactant flooding is one of the big challenges while interfacial tension between surfactant solution and oil after certain concentration involves little changes such as critical micelle concentration (CMC). This article highlights the effect of nanosilica on CMC of Zyziphus Spina Christi, as sugar-based surfactant, in aqueous solutions for enhanced oil recovery and reservoir stimulation purposes. A conductivity approach was selected to assess the CMC of the introduced surfactant in aqueous solution at 25°C. The influence of nanosilica concentrations on CMC variation of introduced surfactant is considered. It is found that CMC of introduced surfactant decreased while the concentration of the nanosilica increased.

Consequently, methods of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) should be applied for more recovery from these reservoirs. In this study the ability of hydrophobic nanoparticles of sio<inf>2</inf> in EOR process through carbonate rock samples is studied. By employing hydrophobic nanosilica, we can lower interfacial tension between oil and nanofluid and then reduce the mobility ratio between oil and nanofluid in carbonate reservoirs; however, nanosilica can increase the viscosity of water exponentially. To evaluate this goal, core displacement experiment for carbonate core is conducted. These experiments are performed on the carbonate samples saturated with oil and brine that had got injected with nanosilica with six different concentrations. Investigating the outcomes shows that by rising nanoparticle concentration, the IFT between water and oil phases decreases and yields in decrease the mobility ratio between oil and nanofluid. For this, we measure the recovery level in different states of using 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, and 0 concentration of the nanoparticle. The outcomes achieved from our experiments reveals that employing hydrophobic nanosilica could increases the oil recovery factor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbonate Reservoir; Hydrophobic; Microemulsion; Nanoparticle; Oil Reovery; Carbonates; Carbonation; Hydrophobicity; Microemulsions; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Oil Well Flooding; Petroleum Reservoir Engineering; Petroleum Reservoirs; Secondary Recovery; Sedimentary Rocks; Carbonate Cores; Carbonate Reservoir; Displacement Experiments; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Hydrophobic Nanoparticles; Mobility Ratios; Nanoparticle Concentrations; Oil Recoveries; Enhanced Recovery","Carbonates; Carbonation; Hydrophobicity; Microemulsions; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Secondary recovery; Sedimentary rocks; Carbonate cores; Carbonate reservoir; Displacement experiments; Enhanced oil recovery; Hydrophobic nanoparticles; Mobility ratios; Nanoparticle concentrations; Oil recoveries; Enhanced recovery","","","","Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Adsorption of novel nonionic surfactant and particles mixture in carbonates: Enhanced oil recovery implication, Energy and Fuels, 26, 8, pp. 4655-4663, (2012); Ahmadi, Mohammadali, Nanofluid in Hydrophilic State for EOR Implication Through Carbonate Reservoir, Journal of Dispersion Science and Technology, 35, 11, pp. 1537-1542, (2014); Di, Qingfeng, Innovative drag reduction of flow in rock's micro-channels using nano particles adsorbing method, 2, pp. 1152-1162, (2010); Emerging Petroleum Oriented Nanotechnologies for Reservoir Engineering SPE 102060, (2009); A Study of Wettability and Permeability Change Caused by Adsorption of Nanometer Structured Polysilicon on the Surface of Porous Media SPE 77938, (2002); Ju, Binshan, Experimental study and mathematical model of nanoparticle transport in porous media, Powder Technology, 192, 2, pp. 195-202, (2009); China Particuol, (2006); Kanj, Mazen Yousef, Nanofluid coreflood experiments in the ARAB-D, (2009); Rodriguez, Elena, Enhanced migration of surface-treated nanoparticles in sedimentary rocks, SPE Annual Technical Conference Proceedings, 4, pp. 2058-2078, (2009); Singh, Subodh, Vital role of nanopolymers in drilling and stimulations fluid applications, SPE Annual Technical Conference Proceedings, 1, pp. 71-77, (2010)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","15322459; 10916466","","PSTEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978245701"

The residues of these synthetic organic compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), acridine orange (AO) and other aromatics, as well as their degraded intermediates, may become carcinogens or mutagens, which severely affect human health. In the cell, these organic compounds can intercalate into the major grooves and interstices between the base pair of DNA double helix, resulting in several diseases and cancers. In other words, DNA can be utilized as the most efficient bio-adsorbent of such toxic agents. For this purpose, DNA must be in water-insoluble state. Recently, radiation has been proven to be one of the effective methods of introducing the crosslinking network in the polymer matrix. Though DNA is easily broken by radiation, it can crosslink in the presence of suitable crosslinkers, or be immobilized onto the crosslinking gels. In this study, we have successfully prepared DNA/BSA complex gels from aqueous mixtures of DNA with BSA by gamma irradiation.

In particular for thermal reactor applications, CANDLE block-type high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) with either U-Pu or U-Th fuel cycle had been proposed and investigated for their simple and safe reactor operation, and the ease of designing a long life reactor. In this work, we investigated the use of Pa-231 mixed homogeneously in the (Th-232/U-233)O<inf>2</inf> fuel kernel of the TRISO particles, that is the U-Th-Pa fuel, to obtain better CANDLE burnup performance. Some consideration on how to supply the required U-233 and Pa-231 was also thoroughly discussed. U-Th-Pa fuel decreases the required amount of natural Gd burnable poison in the fresh fuel for establishing a valid CANDLE HTGR design since Pa-231 has a large thermal absorption cross section. Besides the role as a burnable poison nuclide, Pa-231 also serves as a fertile nuclide during the CANDLE burning since Pa-231 is finally transmuted to a fissile U-233 nuclide. A promising analysis result shows that for U-233 and Pa-231 concentrations of 15 and 7.50 w/o, respectively, the discharged burnup can be increased from 138 (U-Th fuel) to 149 GWd/t. This extends the core life time about 16%, i.e. from 35 (U-Th fuel) to 41 years with CANDLE active core height of 800 cm and reactor thermal power of 30 MWth. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Burnup Performance; Candle Reactor; Thorium Fuel; U-th-pa; Fuels; Gas Cooled Reactors; High Temperature Applications; Isotopes; Burn Up; Burnable Poisons; Candle Reactor; Nuclide Densities; Thermal Absorptions; Thermal Power; Thermal Reactors; Thorium Fuels; High Temperature Gas Reactors","Fuels; Gas cooled reactors; High temperature applications; Isotopes; Burn up; Burnable poisons; CANDLE reactor; Nuclide densities; Thermal absorptions; Thermal power; Thermal reactors; Thorium fuels; High temperature gas reactors","","","H.N.

The emitted biogas comprised 57.7%-60.8% methane, 14.5%-31.5% carbon dioxide, 10.8%-24.7% nitrogen, and 329-423 ppm of nitrous oxide. In the OAS, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) degraded as the methane emission rate increased from influent to effluent. Finally, 94.4% of the total COD was removed. More than 90% of the removed COD converted to methane. Methane emitted from the bottom and the wall surface of the OAS. Methane-producing bacteria was detected by a cloning analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. The predominant species differed depending on the degradation characteristics of the RSS wastewater in the OAS. The emission rate of methane and nitrous oxide ranged between 2.58 and 8.85 NL/(m2 hr) and between 0.074 and 0.410 NL/(m2/hr), respectively. Moreover, 0.153 t-CO<inf>2eq</inf> of GHGs were emitted from 1 m3 of RSS wastewater treatment. Nitrous oxide accounted for 65% of the total GHGs emissions because of its high global warming potential. Therefore, both nitrous oxide and methane that emitted from the treatment of wastewater from a natural rubber processing factory must be considered as significant contributors to the GHGs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ghgs Emissions; Methane; Natural Rubber Processing Wastewater; Nitrous Oxide; Open-type Anaerobic System; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Data Storage Equipment; Effluents; Gas Emissions; Global Warming; Methane; Nitrogen Oxides; Rna; Rubber; Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Systems; Anaerobic Waste Water Treatment; Degradation Characteristics; Ghgs Emissions; Global Warming Potential; Methane Producing Bacteria; Nitrous Oxide; Rubber Processing; Greenhouse Gases","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Data storage equipment; Effluents; Gas emissions; Global warming; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; RNA; Rubber; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic systems; Anaerobic waste water treatment; Degradation characteristics; GHGs emissions; Global warming potential; Methane producing bacteria; Nitrous oxide; Rubber processing; Greenhouse gases","","","","Anotai, Jin, Integrated treatment scheme for rubber thread wastewater: Sulfide precipitation and biological processes, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 141, 1, pp. 1-7, (2007); Boonsawang, Piyarat, Enhancement of sludge granulation in anaerobic treatment of concentrated latex wastewater, Songklanakarin Journal of Science and Technology, 30, SUPPL. 1, pp. 111-119, (2008); Chaiprapat, Sumate S., Effects of wastewater recycling from natural rubber smoked sheet production on economic crops in southern Thailand, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 51, 3, pp. 577-590, (2007); Chaiprapat, Sumate S., Evaluating sulfuric acid reduction, substitution, and recovery to improve environmental performance and biogas productivity in rubber latex industry, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 94, C, pp. 420-429, (2015); Daelman, Matthijs R.J., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from municipal wastewater treatment - Results from a long-term study, Water Science and Technology, 67, 10, pp. 2350-2355, (2013); Foley, Jeffrey M., Nitrous oxide generation in full-scale biological nutrient removal wastewater treatment plants, Water Research, 44, 3, pp. 831-844, (2010); Hatamoto, M., Rubber and methane recovery from deproteinized natural rubber wastewater by coagulation pre-treatment and anaerobic treatment, International Journal of Environmental Research, 6, 3, pp. 577-584, (2012); Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing, (2007); 2006 Ipcc Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, (2006); Jawjit, Warit, Evaluating environmental performance of concentrated latex production in Thailand, Journal of Cleaner Production, 98, pp. 84-91, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969327003"

The Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model was used to assess seven scenarios having the same socioeconomic development but different shares of RE in power generation. By comparing different relative reductions caused by the emission constraints vis-a-vis the business-as-usual (BaU) scenario, the mitigation costs can be estimated. Results show that the economic impact could be reduced by around 55% in terms of welfare loss (from 6.0% to 2.7%) and by around 36% in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) loss (from 3.4% to 2.1%) through the incorporation of high levels of renewable energy. Furthermore, the additional double deployment of wind and SPV to 5.4% and 12.0%, respectively, which currently comprise 43.1% of the renewable energies used in electricity generation, could reduce the GDP loss from 2.1% to 1.9% and reduce the welfare loss from 2.7% to 1.5% in order to achieve a 25.0% GHG emissions reduction. These losses are less than those in the pricing-only scenario (2.1% and 2.3%, respectively). © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aim/cge Model; Emissions Gap; Energy Outlook Of Vietnam; Intended Nationally Determined Contribution; Power Development Plan; Renewable Energies; Barium Alloys; Binary Alloys; Cost Accounting; Economics; Emission Control; Greenhouse Gases; Uranium Alloys; Asia-pacific Integrated Models; Energy Production Systems; Gross Domestic Products; Intended Nationally Determined Contribution; Power Development; Renewable Energies; Socio-economic Development; Viet Nam; Economic And Social Effects","Barium alloys; Binary alloys; Cost accounting; Economics; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Uranium alloys; Asia-pacific integrated models; Energy production systems; Gross domestic products; Intended nationally determined contribution; Power development; Renewable energies; Socio-economic development; Viet Nam; Economic and social effects","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16K18177, Japan.","Expectations for A New Climate Agreement, (2014); Designing and Preparing Intended Nationally Determined Contributions Indcs, (2015); Intended Nationally Determined Contributions Under the Unfccc Discussion Paper, (2014); Emissions Gap Report 2012, (2013); Turton, Hal, Long-term security of energy supply and climate change, Energy Policy, 34, 15, pp. 2232-2250, (2006); Environ Syst Res, (2010); Mathiesen, Brian Vad, 100% Renewable energy systems, climate mitigation and economic growth, Applied Energy, 88, 2, pp. 488-501, (2011); Ludig, Sylvie, Fluctuating renewables in a long-term climate change mitigation strategy, Energy, 36, 11, pp. 6674-6685, (2011); Luderer, Gunnar, The role of renewable energy in climate stabilization: Results from the EMF27 scenarios, Climatic Change, 123, 3-4, pp. 427-441, (2014); Fuss, Sabine, Renewables and climate change mitigation: Irreversible energy investment under uncertainty and portfolio effects, Energy Policy, 40, 1, pp. 59-68, (2012)","","MDPI AG Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982985719"

Velocity profiles of bubbles and liquid have been measured using multiwave UVP. Simultaneously, cross-sectional void fraction distribution has been measured using WMT. As the result, a combination method has been set up. The measured parameters are indispensable in order to obtain detailed structures of two-phase flow. Multiwave UVP method exploits two basic ultrasonic frequencies which are 2 MHz and 8 MHz. Simultaneous measurement of velocity profiles of bubbles (using 2 MHz frequency) and those of liquid (using 8 MHz frequency), at the same position, is enabled. A multiwave ultrasonic transducer (multiwave TDX) which is able to emit and receive the two ultrasonic frequencies along the measurement line at the same time has been applied. The signal processing is based on the pulsed Doppler method. Using the combination method, first, instantaneous velocity profiles and void fraction distribution have been measured simultaneously for air-water counter-current bubbly flow in a vertical pipe. Flow structure has been clarified. Effect of initial condition on void fraction distribution has been confirmed. Next, measurements have been carried out for subcooled boiling bubbly flow in a vertical pipe. For measurement of subcooled boiling flow, a high temperature wire mesh sensor (WMS) has been developed.

The influences of these three independent variables and their interactions were determined using the RSM; the optimum amounts of TEPA, DEA, and MeOH were 1.33 g (7.03 mmol), 0.85 g (8.08 mmol), and 58.2 g, for the preparation of 3 g of sorbent, respectively. Under the adsorption conditions of 40 °C and 100 kPa CO<inf>2</inf>, the optimum sorbent showed fast kinetics and an excellent CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption of 5.64 mmol/g; the value predicted by the RSM model was 5.67 mmol/g. Analysis of variance and the coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9525) showed the utility of the approach used in this study to optimize the conditions for preparing high-performance solid sorbents.

I., The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden","In advanced designs of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), for mitigation of severe accident consequences, on the one hand, the In-Vessel Retention (IVR) concept has been implemented. On the other hand in other new NPP designs (Generation HI and III+) with large power reactors, the External Core Catcher (ECC) has been widely adopted. Assessment of ECC design robustness is largely based on analysis of heat transfer of a melt pool formed in the ECC. Transient heat transfer analysis of an ECC is challenging due to (i) uncertainty in the in-vessel accident progression and subsequent vessel failure modes; (ii) long transient, (iii) high Rayleigh number and complex flows involving phase change of the melt pool formed in an ECC. The present paper is concerned with analysis of transient melt pool heat transfer in the ECC of new Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) designed by Toshiba Corporation (Japan). According to the ABWR severe accident management strategy, the ECC is initially dry. In order to prevent steam explosion flooding is initiated after termination of melt relocation from the vessel. The ECC full of melt is cooled from the top directly by water and from the bottom through the ECC walls. In order to assess sustainability of the ECC, heat transfer simulation of a stratified melt pool formed in the ECC is carried out. The problem addressed in this work is heat flux distribution at ECC boundaries when cooling is applied (i) from the bottom, (ii) from the top and from the bottom. To perform melt pool heat transfer simulation, we employ Phase-change Effective Convectivity Model (PECM) which was originally developed as a computationally efficient, sufficiently accurate, 2D/3D accident analysis tools for simulation of transient melt pool heat transfer in the reactor lower plenum. Thermal loads from the melt pool to ECC boundaries are determined for selected ex-vessel accident scenarios. Performance of the ECC, efficiency of severe accident management (SAM) measures and procedures are evaluated based on results of PECM simulation and severe accident analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Core Catcher; Heat Transfer; Severe Accident; Severe Accident Management (sam); Accident Prevention; Accidents; Boiling Water Reactors; Design; Heat Flux; Hydraulics; Lakes; Nuclear Power Plants; Nuclear Reactor Accidents; Nuclear Reactors; Reactor Cores; Uncertainty Analysis; Advanced Boiling Water Reactors; Computationally Efficient; Core Catchers; Heat Flux Distributions; Heat Transfer Simulation; Severe Accident; Severe Accident Management; Transient Heat Transfer; Heat Transfer","Accident prevention; Accidents; Boiling water reactors; Design; Heat flux; Hydraulics; Lakes; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear reactors; Reactor cores; Uncertainty analysis; Advanced boiling water reactors; Computationally efficient; Core catchers; Heat flux distributions; Heat transfer simulation; Severe accident; Severe accident management; Transient heat transfer; Heat transfer","","","","Proceedings of Icapp2011, (2011); Vayssier, George L.C.M., Present day EOPs and SAMG - where do we go from here?, Nuclear Engineering and Technology, 44, 3, pp. 225-236, (2012); undefined, (2015); Fukushima Daiichi Accident Study, (2012); Gauntt, Randall O., MELCOR simulations of the severe accident at the Fukushima 1F1 reactor, pp. 212-221, (2012); Kudinov, P.

Accurate measurement of v<inf>c</inf> is required to improve the numerical simulation of the flow. In this study, using multiwave ultrasound, a novel method has been developed for the measurement of v<inf>c</inf>. The velocity of the top and bottom interfaces of bubbles are measured by using two measurement lines. One line has an upward direction. The other has a downward direction. From the velocity difference between the two measurement lines, v<inf>c</inf> can be calculated. By comparison with the result of the optical visualization method, the accuracy of the measured data of v<inf>c</inf> is confirmed. Using ultrasound, measurements can be carried out for opaque fluid, non-transparent flow boundaries and extreme conditions of industrial flows (e.g. high pressure, high temperature etc.). The proposed method can be highly useful to provide validation data to improve existing correlations used in numerical simulation. Consequently, the accuracy of the numerical simulation result can be improved.

In particular for thermal reactor applications, CANDLE blocktype high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) with either uranium or thorium fuel cycle had been proposed and investigated for their simple and safe reactor operation, and the ease of designing a long life reactor. Small sized long life CANDLE HTGRs with thorium fuel shows superior burnup performance than the ones with uranium fuel but their axial power peaks are relatively higher which may not be advantageous during a depressurization accident. In this work, we proposed and investigated the use of Pa-231 mixed homogeneously in the (Th-232/U-233)O<inf>2</inf> fuel kernel of the TRISO particles to obtain lower axial power peaks. Addition of Pa-231 decreases the required amount of natural gadolinium burnable poison in the fresh fuel for establishing a valid CANDLE HTGR design since Pa-231 has a large thermal absorption cross section. Besides the role as a burnable poison nuclide, Pa-231 also serves as a fertile nuclide during the CANDLE burning since Pa-231 is finally transmuted to a fissile U-233 nuclide. A promising analysis result shows that for U-233 enrichment of 15 w/o and Pa-231 addition of 7.50 w/o, the axial power peak is decreased from 5.9 to 3.6 W/cm3 while the averaged burnup is increased from 138 to 149 GWd/t. This extends the core life time about 16 %, i.e. from 35 to 41 years with CANDLE active core height of 800 cm and reactor thermal power of 30 MWth. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Axial Power Distribution Flattening; Candle; Htgr; Pa-231; Small Sized Long Life Reactor; Thorium Fuel Cycle; Fuels; Gas Cooled Reactors; High Temperature Applications; Isotopes; Nuclear Energy; Nuclear Engineering; Nuclear Reactor Accidents; Thorium; Uranium; Axial Power Distribution; Candle; Htgr; Long Life; Thorium Fuel Cycles; High Temperature Gas Reactors","Fuels; Gas cooled reactors; High temperature applications; Isotopes; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear reactor accidents; Thorium; Uranium; Axial power distribution; CANDLE; HTGR; Long life; Thorium fuel cycles; High temperature gas reactors","","","","Sekimoto, Hiroshi, CANDLE: The new burnup strategy, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 139, 3, pp. 306-317, (2001); Ohoka, Yasunori, Application of CANDLE burnup to block-type high temperature gas cooled reactor, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 229, 1, pp. 15-23, (2004); Ohoka, Yasunori, Simulation study on CANDLE burnup applied to block-type high temperature gas cooled reactor, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 47, 1-4, pp. 292-299, (2005); Ismail, Long life small CANDLE-HTGRs with thorium, Annals of Nuclear Energy, 34, 1-2, pp. 120-129, (2007); Proc of Genes 4 Anp 2003, (2003); Liem, Peng Hong, Small high temperature gas-cooled reactors with innovative nuclear burning, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 50, 2-6, pp. 251-256, (2008); Tran, Hoai Nam, Neutronic feasibility study of U-Th-Pa based high burnup fuel for pebble bed reactors, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 80, pp. 17-23, (2015); Proc 2nd Annu Jnc Int Forum on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, (2000); Imamura, Tomo, Potential of 231pa for gas cooled long-life core, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 39, 3, pp. 226-233, (2002); Jaea Data Code 2007 004, (2007)","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) infocentral@asme.org","et al.; GLSEQ, LLC/SCI Technologies.

The efficiency of maximum power point tracking that is obtained by the proposed method is theoretically guaranteed under assumptions that represent physical conditions. Several control parameters may be adjusted to ensure the quality of control performance. In particular, a DFIG state-space model and a control technique based on the Lyapunov function are adopted to derive the control method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via numerical simulations of a 1.5-MW DFIG wind turbine using MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show that when the proposed method is used, the wind turbine is capable of properly tracking the optimal operation point; furthermore, the generator's available energy output is higher when the proposed method is used than it is when the conventional method is used instead. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Doubly-fed Induction Generator; Lyapunov Function-based Control; Maximum Energy; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Electric Fault Currents; Electric Generators; Electric Power System Control; Lyapunov Functions; Matlab; Maximum Power Point Trackers; Numerical Methods; Quality Control; State Space Methods; Wind Turbines; Doubly Fed Induction Generator (dfig); Doubly Fed Induction Generators (dfig); Function-based Control; Maximum Energy; Maximum Power Output; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Optimal Operation Point; State - Space Models; Asynchronous Generators","Electric fault currents; Electric generators; Electric power system control; Lyapunov functions; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Numerical methods; Quality control; State space methods; Wind turbines; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Doubly Fed Induction generators (DFIG); Function-based control; Maximum energy; Maximum power output; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Optimal operation point; State - space models; Asynchronous generators","","","","Leon, Andres E., Control strategy of a DVR to improve stability in wind farms using squirrel-cage induction generators, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 26, 3, pp. 1609-1617, (2011); Barakati, S.

Ethanol mixed with gasoline in mandatory percentages has been used in many countries. However, production of ethanol mainly depends on food crops, commonly associated with problems such as governmental policies and social controversies. Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is one of the most potential and appropriate alternative crops for biofuel production because of its high biomass and sugar content, strong tolerance to environmental stress conditions and diseases, and wide adaptability to various soils and climates. The aim of this study was to select prospective varieties of sweet sorghum, optimum sowing times and densities to achieve high yields of ethanol production and to establish stable operational conditions in cultivating this crop. The summer-autumn cropping season combined with the sowing densities of 8.3-10.9 plant m-2 obtained the highest ethanol yield. Among cultivated locations, the soil with pH of 5.5 and contents of Al and Zn of 39.4 and 0.6 g kg-1, respectively, was the best condition to have an ethanol yield >5000 L ha-1. The pH ≥ 6.0 may be responsible for the significant reduction of zinc content in soils, which decreases both biomass of sweet sorghum and ethanol yield, while contents of N, P, K, organic carbon (OC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC), and Fe likely play no role. The cultivar 4A was the preferred candidate for ethanol production and resistant to pests and diseases, especially cut worm (Agrotis spp.). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Ethanol; Ethanol Yield; Pests And Diseases; Sowing Time; Sweet Sorghum; Biofuel; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Crop Yield; Cropping Practice; Ethanol; Fossil Fuel; Ion Exchange; Organic Carbon; Sorghum; Sowing; Sugar; Agrotis; Sorghum Bicolor","biofuel; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; crop yield; cropping practice; ethanol; fossil fuel; ion exchange; organic carbon; sorghum; sowing; sugar; Agrotis; Sorghum bicolor","","","","Fischer, Axel René, Biotic and abiotic transformations of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 12, 6, pp. 381-386, (2005); Belpoggi, Fiorella, Methyl-tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) — A gasoline additive — causes testicular and lympho haematopoietic cancers in rats, Toxicology and Industrial Health, 11, 2, pp. 119-149, (1995); Cassada, David A., Trace analysis of ethanol, MTBE, and related oxygenate compounds in water using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, Analytical Chemistry, 72, 19, pp. 4654-4658, (2000); Biofuels Engineering Process Technology, (2008); Almodares, Abbas A., Production of bioethanol from sweet sorghum: A review, African Journal of Agricultural Research, 4, 9, pp. 772-780, (2009); Balat, Mustafa, Recent trends in global production and utilization of bio-ethanol fuel, Applied Energy, 86, 11, pp. 2273-2282, (2009); Thammasat Int J Sci Technol, (2007); Pulidindi, Indra Neel, Can cellulose be a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production?, Renewable Energy, 71, pp. 77-80, (2014); Wang, Mingxin, Energy efficiency and environmental performance of bioethanol production from sweet sorghum stem based on life cycle analysis, Bioresource Technology, 163, pp. 74-81, (2014); Yu, Menghui, Optimization of ethanol production from NaOH-pretreated solid state fermented sweet sorghum bagasse, Energies, 7, 7, pp. 4054-4067, (2014)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944463058"

An additional content of P231a in a mixed U233-T232h fuel pebble was optimized for simultaneously controlling long-term excess reactivity and attaining high fuel burnup. Because of a large thermal absorption cross section, P231a has a potential to absorb thermal neutrons and act as a burnable absorber in the early stage of burnup. In the latter stage, P231a is transmuted to U233 and act as a fertile fuel. Parametric study was performed for heavy metal (HM) amount, U233 enrichment and P231a content. The objective is to attain a target burnup greater than 100 GWd/T with a low uranium enrichment and a small content of P231a. Six fuel compositions with the HM amount of 9-18 g per pebble, the U233 enrichment of 8 and 10%, and the P231a content of 3.2-5.5% were selected for discussion and comparison. The burnup levels of about 130-170 GWd/t are achieved for the six fuel compositions. The results of temperature coefficient show that negative reactivity feedback during burnup with the increase of temperature is assured, which is one of the important safety parameters. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High Burnup; Pebble Bed Reactor; Thorium Fuel; U-th-pa; Fuels; Heavy Metals; Nuclear Fuels; Planning; Temperature; Feasibility Studies; High-burn Up; Reactivity Feedback; Safety Parameters; Temperature Coefficient; Thermal Absorptions; Thorium Fuels; Uranium Enrichment; Pebble Bed Reactors","Fuels; Heavy metals; Nuclear fuels; Planning; Temperature; Feasibility studies; High-burn up; Reactivity feedback; Safety parameters; Temperature coefficient; Thermal absorptions; Thorium fuels; Uranium enrichment; Pebble bed reactors","","","The authors are grateful to Mr. V.K.

In this study, the multi-cycle core was designed in order to increase thorium utilization and TRU waste transmutation. For that purpose, the reprocessed fuel assemblies inside the subcritical core are shuffled for twice burnt while the thorium assemblies are remained inside the reactor until the end of reactor life. As the result, at the equilibrium state, the thorium fuel contribution to total core power is improved (35.7%) compared to the startup cycle and it has benefit in flattening the power peaking inside the subcritical core. Compare to the startup cycle, less reprocessed fuel is loaded but the reprocessed assemblies are shuffled and burnt twice, hence, the TRUs are transmuted in a deeper level. At discharge, the reduction of radiotoxicity from the TRU waste is about 20% with 1% uncertainty, mainly due to the reduction of Pu and Am. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ads; Multi-cycle; Thorium Utilization; Transmutation; Tru Waste; Ads; Multi-cycle; Transmutation; Tru Transmutation; Tru Waste","ADS; Multi-cycle; Transmutation; TRU transmutation; TRU waste","","","","Chadwick, Mark B., ENDF/B-VII.0: Next Generation Evaluated Nuclear Data Library for Nuclear Science and Technology, Nuclear Data Sheets, 107, 12, pp. 2931-3060, (2006); Jaeri M, (1984); Ivanova, Tatiana T., Impact of cross section covariance data on results of high-confidence criticality validation, Journal of the Korean Physical Society, 59, 23, pp. 1170-1173, (2011); Njoy99 0 Code System for Producing Pointwise and Multigroup Neutron and Photon Cross Sections from Endf B Data, (2000); Srac2006 A Comprehensive Neutronics Calculation Code System, (2007); User S Manual Version 2 0 for Monteburns Version 1 0, (1999); Reduction of the Radiotoxicity of Spent Nuclear Fuel Using A Two Tiered System Comprising Light Water Reactors and Accelerator Driven Systems, (2003); Tsujimoto, Kazufumi, Neutronics design for lead-bismuth cooled accelerator-driven system for transmutation of minor actinide, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 41, 1, pp. 21-36, (2004); Vu, Thanh Mai, Transmutation strategy using thorium-reprocessed fuel ADS for future reactors in Vietnam, Science and Technology of Nuclear Installations, 2013, (2013); Westlén, Daniel, Reducing radiotoxicity in the long run, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 49, 8, pp. 597-605, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03064549; 18732100","0080286941","ANEND","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907203474"

The large geometric distortion of C<inf>60</inf>-M in the tilted C<inf>60</inf>-M-G nanostructures (with Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni) is attributed to the spin polarization in the 3d orbitals and dispersion interactions between graphene and C<inf>60</inf>.

Our results show that halogen atoms can be used as functional groups to tune not only the band gap but also the valence band maximum (VBM) in MOFs. Among halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, I), iodine is the best candidate to reduce the band gap and increase the VBM value. In addition, it has been found that for the antiaromatic linker DHPDC (1,4-dihydropentalene-2,5- dicarboxylic acid) the energy gap is 0.95 eV, which is even lower than those calculated for other aromatic linkers, i.e., FFDC (furo[3,2-b]furan-2,5- dicarboxylic acid) and TTDC (thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid). By analyzing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-highest occupied molecular orbital gaps calculated at the molecular level, we have highlighted the important role of the corresponding organic linkers in the MOF band gap. In particular, the change of C-C-Cî - ?O dihedral angle in the organic linker can be used to analyze the difference of band gaps in MOF crystals. It is shown that a deep understanding of chemical bonding within linker molecules from electronic structure calculations plays a crucial role in designing semiconductor properties of MOF materials for engineering applications. © 2014 American Chemical Society. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic Band Structure; Electronic Structure Calculations; Engineering Applications; Isoreticular Metal-organic Frameworks; Metal Organic Framework; Semiconductor Properties; Thiophene-2 ,5-dicarboxylic Acids; Valence-band Maximums; Aromatic Compounds; Bromine; Chlorine; Crystalline Materials; Density Functional Theory; Electronic Structure; Fluorine; Functional Groups; Iodine; Java Programming Language; Materials Properties; Energy Gap","Electronic band structure; Electronic structure calculations; Engineering applications; Isoreticular metal-organic frameworks; Metal organic framework; Semiconductor properties; Thiophene-2 ,5-dicarboxylic acids; Valence-band maximums; Aromatic compounds; Bromine; Chlorine; Crystalline materials; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Fluorine; Functional groups; Iodine; Java programming language; Materials properties; Energy gap","","","","Rowsell, Jesse L.C., Metal-organic frameworks: A new class of porous materials, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 73, 1-2, pp. 3-14, (2004); Zhou, Hongcai Joe, Introduction to metal-organic frameworks, Chemical Reviews, 112, 2, pp. 673-674, (2012); Li, Jianrong, Metal-organic frameworks for separations, Chemical Reviews, 112, 2, pp. 869-932, (2012); Murray, Leslie J., Hydrogen storage in metal–organic frameworks, Chemical Society Reviews, 38, 5, pp. 1294-1314, (2009); Suh, Myunghyun Paik, Hydrogen storage in metal-organic frameworks, Chemical Reviews, 112, 2, pp. 782-835, (2012); Lee, Jeong-yong, Metal–organic framework materials as catalysts, Chemical Society Reviews, 38, 5, pp. 1450-1459, (2009); Kreno, Lauren E., Metal-organic framework materials as chemical sensors, Chemical Reviews, 112, 2, pp. 1105-1125, (2012); Horcajada, Patricia, Porous metal-organic-framework nanoscale carriers as a potential platform for drug deliveryand imaging, Nature Materials, 9, 2, pp. 172-178, (2010); Furukawa, Hiroyasu, The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks, Science, 341, 6149, (2013); Deng, Hexiang, Large-pore apertures in a series of metal-organic frameworks, Science, 336, 6084, pp. 1018-1023, (2012)","","","","","","","","19327455; 19327447","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897699157"

The results show that even after implementing the master plan, the peak air temperature in the urban areas still remains at the same level of 41°C. However, the expansion of built-up areas largely increases the UHI intensity and raises the nocturnal air temperatures in the built-up areas. The centralized green spaces proposed in the master plan is seen to be insufficient to mitigate UHIs compared to the equally distributed green spaces. The urban air temperature in Hanoi is increased when the westerly or south-westerly Foehn winds flow over the city during the daytime. In contrast, relatively strong and cool southerly winds prevail during the night-time and contribute to reduction in the nocturnal air temperature in the city. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystems; Land Use; Weather Forecasting; Air Temperature; Built-up Areas; Cooling Effects; Green Spaces; Land-use Change; Urban Climates; Urban Heat Island; Weather Research And Forecasting; Atmospheric Temperature","Ecosystems; Land use; Weather forecasting; Air temperature; Built-up areas; Cooling effects; Green spaces; Land-use change; Urban climates; Urban heat island; Weather research and forecasting; Atmospheric temperature","","","We sincerely appreciate the generous supports given by the Vietnam Institute of Urban and Rural Planning.

The uncertainty of JENDL-4.0 is needed to be enhanced to provide more reliable results on reactivity calculation for the fast system. The impact of uncertainty of 232Th capture cross section of ENDF/B-VII is small (0.1%). Therefore, it will cause no significant impact of the thorium cross section library on the thorium utilized ADS design calculation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Libraries; Uncertainty Analysis; Accelerator-driven System; Capture Cross Sections; Cross-section Library; Cross-section Uncertainties; Design Calculations; Fast Neutron Spectrums; Reliable Results; Thorium Fuels; Thorium","Libraries; Uncertainty analysis; Accelerator-driven system; Capture cross sections; Cross-section library; Cross-section uncertainties; Design calculations; Fast neutron spectrums; Reliable results; Thorium fuels; Thorium","","","","Transmutation of Nuclear Waste in Accelerator Driven Systems, (2004); Ismail, Performance of natural uranium- and thorium-fueled fast breeder reactors (FBRs) for 233U fissile production, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 50, 2-6, pp. 290-294, (2008); Vu, Thanh Mai, Transmutation strategy using thorium-reprocessed fuel ADS for future reactors in Vietnam, Science and Technology of Nuclear Installations, 2013, (2013); Shibata, Keiichi, JENDL-4.0: A new library for nuclear science and engineering, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 48, 1, pp. 1-30, (2011); Vu, Thanh Mai, Accuracy of thorium cross section of JENDL-4.0 library in thorium based fuel core evaluation, Annals of Nuclear Energy, 57, pp. 173-178, (2013); Reduction of the Radiotoxicity of Spent Nuclear Fuel Using A Two Tiered System Comprising Light Water Reactors and Accelerator Driven Systems, (2003); Chadwick, Mark B., ENDF/B-VII.0: Next Generation Evaluated Nuclear Data Library for Nuclear Science and Technology, Nuclear Data Sheets, 107, 12, pp. 2931-3060, (2006); Jaeri M, (1984); Srac2006 A Comprehensive Neutronics Calculation Code System, (2007); Ivanova, Tatiana T., Impact of cross section covariance data on results of high-confidence criticality validation, Journal of the Korean Physical Society, 59, 23, pp. 1170-1173, (2011)","","Hindawi Limited 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb New York NY 10022","","","","","","16876075; 16876083","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907383191"

Two types of substrate solutions, a glucose, sodium acetate, and lactic acid mixture, as well as glycerol, were prepared and fed by mixing the two solutions to increase the ratio, in a stepwise manner, of glycerol from 0% to 100%, while keeping a loading of COD at 2.5kgm-3d-1 throughout the fermentation process. Vigorous methane gas production, approximately 580dm3m-3d-1, was observed during the acclimation stages.

Initial moisture content of the bagasse was found to affect biological delignification by MG-60, and 75% moisture content was suitable for selective lignin degradation and subsequent ethanol production. Additives, such as basal media, organic compounds, or minerals, also affected biological delignification of bagasse by MG-60. Basal medium addition improved both delignification and ethanol production. Some inorganic chemical factors, such as Fe2+, Mn2+, or Cu2+, reduced bagasse carbohydrate degradation by MG-60 during delignifying incubations and resulted in increased ethanol production.

The motivation behind this study was that the growing requirements for Japanese local governments to gain support from citizens might cause a problem. The problem was the disparity between donor citizens and recipients in the aid envisioned. In our social survey, we investigated the views of citizens in Kitakyushu, Japan, within a specific context of helping large Vietnamese cities. In particular, we mentioned Da Nang City as an example. Many of our respondents chose ""drinking water quality,"" ""river/sea pollution,"" and ""waste management"" as important environmental problems in the Vietnamese cities. These problems were in line with those officially recognized by the administrators of Da Nang. However, there were sharp differences in perceived environmental problems between the respondents and urban dwellers in Da Nang. Background knowledge of Vietnam, owing to previous visits there, and of Kitakyushu's aid activities in the country clearly affected the choices of the important environmental problems. Provision of information on the environment in Da Nang changed the ranking among the top four problems, but the items within the set remained the same as before. Both knowledge gained as a result of visiting Vietnam and knowledge of Kitakyushu's aid activities in the country contributed to maintaining initial views after the presentation of the Da Nang information.

The intercalation nanostructures of interest are classified based on the atomic ratio of Cr with respect to C on two graphene layers, and we accordingly assign nomenclatures to the intercalation nanostructures as 1-4, 1-12, and 1-16 GMG. Binding energy analysis suggests that the 1-12 and 1-16 GMG structures are energetically stable, whereas the 1-4 GMG structure is unstable. When examining the 1-4 bilayer graphene-Cr (GGM) structure, we have found that it is energetically stable and nonmagnetic. On the other hand, all three GMG intercalation structures are found to be ferromagnetic, and the 1-16 GMG structure exhibits the highest total magnetization (2.00 μ<inf>B</inf>/cell), whereas the 1-12 GMG structure exhibits the lowest total magnetization (0.46 μ<inf>B</inf>/cell).

It is found for the two stable nanostructures that the 2p<inf>z</inf> orbitals of graphene layers are aligned antiferromagnetically with respect to the Cr layer, thus causing negative contributions to total magnetic moments of two stable GMG nanostructures. © 2013 American Chemical Society. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atomic Ratio; Bi-layer; Binding Energy Analysis; Density Functional Theory Calculations; Graphene Layers; Nonmagnetics; Orbitals; Theoretical Investigations; Total Magnetization; Density Functional Theory; Electronic Structure; Magnetic Moments; Magnetic Properties; Nanostructures; Graphene","Atomic ratio; Bi-layer; Binding energy analysis; Density functional theory calculations; Graphene layers; Nonmagnetics; Orbitals; Theoretical investigations; Total magnetization; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Magnetic moments; Magnetic properties; Nanostructures; Graphene","","","","Geim, Andre K., The rise of graphene, Nature Materials, 6, 3, pp. 183-191, (2007); Ghaemi, Pouyan, Near-zero modes in superconducting graphene, Physica Scripta, T146, (2012); Afshar, Mahdi H., Magnetic properties of single 3d transition metals adsorbed on graphene and benzene: A density functional theory study, Journal of Applied Physics, 110, 6, (2011); Jishi, Radi A., Theoretical investigation of two-dimensional superconductivity in intercalated graphene layers, Advanced Studies in Theoretical Physics, 5, 13-16, pp. 703-716, (2011); NAKADA, K., Migration of adatom adsorption on graphene using DFT calculation, Solid State Communications, 151, 1, pp. 13-16, (2011); Avdoshenko, Stanislav M., Organometallic complexes of graphene: Toward atomic spintronics using a graphene web, ACS Nano, 5, 12, pp. 9939-9949, (2011); Giovannetti, Gianluca, Doping graphene with metal contacts, Physical Review Letters, 101, 2, (2008); Weser, Martin, Induced magnetism of carbon atoms at the graphene/Ni(111) interface, Applied Physics Letters, 96, 1, (2010); Muszynski, Ryan, Decorating graphene sheets with gold nanoparticles, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 112, 14, pp. 5263-5266, (2008); Hong, Wenjing, Preparation of gold nanoparticle/graphene composites with controlled weight contents and their application in biosensors, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 114, 4, pp. 1822-1826, (2010)","","","","","","","","19327455; 19327447","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874145934"

The blending process of bio-kerosene which is a mixture of bio-jet paraffins and fossil kerosene is also displayed. The two prototypes of bio-paraffins (Bio-P1 and Bio-JP2), which were manufactured in Indonesia following the proposed production process, are used for making bio-kerosenes in current study. The theoretical and experimental investigations have been carried out to evaluate and identify the critical properties of bio-kerosenes: distillations, freezing point, lower heating value, density, flash point and viscosity to ensure ASTM criteria of jet fuel. The results show it can be blended directly 5% volume of Bio-P1 or 10% volume of Bio-JP2 to commercial Jet A-1 for powering aviation gas turbine engines without redesigning fuel system or fuel supply infrastructure. The use of these bio-paraffins not only reduces CO<inf>2</inf> lifecycle but also significantly decreases emissions of sulfur compounds (SO<inf>x</inf>).

This article estimates the effects of migration on residential energy use and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions quantitatively, basing the probability of being a migrant on the economic, demographic and dwelling characteristics of households. The results of this study indicate that the effects of migration involve reductions in energy consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Urban-to-urban migration is shown to have no statistically significant impact on per capita energy consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, which indicates that population increases through urban-to-urban population growth and natural population growth have no statistically significant differences in this regard. However, rural-to-urban migration is shown to have a significant and negative influence on residential energy consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Population growth led by rural-to-urban migration produces lower energy consumption estimates than natural population growth. Thus, energy consumption estimates are lower when a city's population increase is caused by rural-to-urban migration than when urban-to-urban migration and natural population growth are the main drivers of population increases. These results have important policy implications for developing urban cities regarding population growth and energy consumption. © 2013 International Energy Initiative. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Migration; Residential Energy Consumption; Urbanization; Vietnam; Carbon Dioxide; Energy Policy; Housing; Population Statistics; Public Policy; Urban Growth; Migration; Natural Population; Policy Implications; Residential Energy; Residential Energy Consumption; Statistically Significant Difference; Urbanization; Viet Nam; Energy Utilization; Carbon Emission; Energy Conservation; Energy Use; Internal Migration; Population Growth; Residential Energy; Urbanization; Hanoi","Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Housing; Population statistics; Public policy; Urban growth; Migration; Natural population; Policy implications; Residential energy; Residential energy consumption; Statistically significant difference; Urbanization; Viet Nam; Energy utilization; carbon emission; energy conservation; energy use; internal migration; population growth; residential energy; urbanization; Hanoi","","","This research was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan , Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 21810019 , 22310030 , 23710057 , 25257102 ); the Strategic Funds for the Promotion of Science and Technology , “Global Environmental Leaders Education Program for Designing a Low-Carbon Society”; and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of Environment, Japan , “Establishing of Methodology to Evaluate Middle to Long Term Environmental Policy Options toward Asian Low-Carbon Society (S-6).” The authors greatly appreciate the assistance and cooperation of field investigators, survey respondents and data entry personnel.

The lightning current to the tower top as well as to phase conductors was estimated using the electrogeometric model. Increasing the number of phases on which EGLAs were installed in one circuit reduces the likelihood of back flashover. Installing EGLAs on the three phases of one circuit has two advantages, viz., 1) eliminating double circuit outages and 2) preventing lightning-induced back flashovers for strikes to the tower top {\leq} 200 kA. However, EGLAs on one circuit cannot improve lightning performance related to the shielding failure when the unprotected circuit is hit. EGLA duty varied little with the number of phases on which EGLAs were installed, which indicates that the required EGLA rating is unlikely to depend on the number of phases on which EGLAs are installed. © 1986-2012 IEEE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electromagnetic Transients Program/alternative Transients Program (emtp)/(atp); Externally Gapped Line Arrester (egla); Insulation Coordination; Transmission Line; Alternative Transients Program; Double Circuit; Electrogeometric Model; Electromagnetic Transients Program (emtp); Lightning Currents; Lightning Performance; Line Arresters; Phase Conductors; Shielding Failure; Three Phasis; Electric Insulation Coordination; Electric Lines; Flammability Testing; Flashover; Lightning; Transmission Line Theory; Transients","Alternative transients program; Double circuit; Electrogeometric model; Electromagnetic transients program (EMTP); Lightning currents; Lightning performance; Line arresters; Phase conductors; Shielding failure; Three phasis; Electric insulation coordination; Electric lines; Flammability testing; Flashover; Lightning; Transmission line theory; Transients","","","Manuscript received September 15, 2011; accepted February 04, 2012.

The test was conducted as a single-well Huff'n' Puff. CO<inf>2</inf> was injected into the well and the well was flowed after soaking. In order to confirm the CO<inf>2</inf>-EOR effect the following items were monitored during the test: 1) CO<inf>2</inf> Injection Performance 2) Real Time Bottom-hole Pressure/Temperature 3) Oil/Gas/Water/CO<inf>2</inf> Production Performance 4) Fluids' Saturation Change before and after CO<inf>2</inf> Injection 5) Produced Fluid Property & Composition on-site Over 100 tons of CO<inf>2</inf> were successfully injected into the well. Bottom-hole pressure was kept higher than MMP (Minimum Miscibility Pressure) during the injection period, thus miscible condition was considered to be achieved in the reservoir at least near the wellbore. The vertical contrast of CO<inf>2</inf> injectivity and oil saturation change in the reservoir were confirmed by saturation logs and production logs. Clear increment of oil rate, reduction of water cut and oil composition change were observed after CO<inf>2</inf> injection. Simulation study for matching pilot test performance was carried out and its result was in good agreement with the monitored data.

In KOH aqueous solutions, electrodes containing different binders showed quite different properties. The PE-containing electrode showed the highest capacity retention up to 14 cycles (330 mAh g -1, 82.7%). However, capacity fading was observed subsequently, and only 24.6% capacity remained after 30 cycles. In contrast, the PTFE-containing electrode showed continuous capacity fading but the best capacity retention of 38.6% after 30 cycles. Comparing the amount of dropout Fe <inf>2</inf>O <inf>3</inf> from electrodes after charge/discharge measurements, it was reasonable to find that the electrodes with better cycling performance showed less Fe <inf>2</inf>O <inf>3</inf> dropout. When K <inf>2</inf>S additives were applied, both the electrodes fabricated with PTFE and PE showed superior cycling performance, which was attributed to the good stability of PTFE and PE binders.

The Pt nanoparticles exhibited well-shaped polyhedral morphology with highly fine and specific nanostructures in the size range of 20 nm. Important evidences of core-shell configurations of the Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles were clearly characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements. The results of HRTEM images showed that the core-shell Pt-Pd nanoparticles in the size range of 25 nm with polyhedral morphology were synthesized with the thin Pd shells of ∼3 nm in thickness as the atomic Pd layers grown on the Pt cores. Very interesting characteristics of surface structure of Pt nanostructures and Pt-Pd core-shell nanostructures with surface defects were observed. The high-resolution TEM images of Pt-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles showed that the Frank-van der Merwe and Stranski-Krastanov growth modes coexist in the nucleation and growth of the Pd shells on the as-prepared Pt cores. It is predicted that the FM growth becomes the main favorable growth compared with the SK growth in the formation of the thin Pd shells of Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles. The experimental evidence of the deformations of lattice fringes and lattice-fringe patterns was found in Pt and Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles. The interesting renucleation and recrystallization at the attachments between the nanoparticles are revealed to form a good lattice match. In addition, our novel ideas of the largest surface-area superlattices and promising utilization of them are proposed for next generations of various fuel cells with low cost. Finally, the products of Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles can be potentially utilized as highly efficient catalysts in the realization of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and direct methanol fuel cell using the very low Pt loading with better cost-effective design. © 2012 American Chemical Society. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bimetallic Nanoparticles; Core-shell; Core-shell Morphologies; Core-shell Nanoparticles; Core-shell Nanostructures; Cost Effective Design; Efficient Catalysts; Electron Transmission Microscopy; Experimental Evidence; Facile Synthesis; High Resolution; High-resolution Tem; Hrtem Images; Lattice Fringes; Lattice Match; Low Costs; Nucleation And Growth; Poly(vinyl Pyrrolidone); Polyhedral Morphologies; Pt Loading; Pt Nanoparticles; Renucleation; Silver Nitrates; Size Ranges; Stranski-krastanov Growth Mode; Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (dmfc); Ethylene Glycol; Loading; Morphology; Nanoparticles; Palladium; Shells (structures); Synthesis (chemical); Transmission Electron Microscopy; Platinum","Bimetallic nanoparticles; Core-shell; Core-shell morphologies; Core-shell nanoparticles; Core-shell nanostructures; Cost effective design; Efficient catalysts; Electron transmission microscopy; Experimental evidence; Facile synthesis; High resolution; High-resolution TEM; HRTEM images; Lattice fringes; Lattice match; Low costs; Nucleation and growth; Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone); Polyhedral morphologies; Pt loading; Pt nanoparticles; Renucleation; Silver nitrates; Size ranges; Stranski-Krastanov growth mode; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Ethylene glycol; Loading; Morphology; Nanoparticles; Palladium; Shells (structures); Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; Platinum","","","","Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, (2004); Polarz, Sebastian, Shape matters: Anisotropy of the morphology of inorganic colloidal particles - Synthesis and function, Advanced Functional Materials, 21, 17, pp. 3214-3230, (2011); Duncan, Hugues, Hydrogen adsorption/absorption on Pd/Pt(1 1 1) multilayers, Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, 621, 1, pp. 62-68, (2008); LeBon, Alexandre, Hydrogen interaction in Pd-Pt alloy nanoparticles, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 116, 1, pp. 126-133, (2012); Shao, Minhua, Palladium-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions, Journal of Power Sources, 196, 5, pp. 2433-2444, (2011); Chen, Mei, Small adsorbate-assisted shape control of Pd and Pt nanocrystals, Advanced Materials, 24, 7, pp. 862-879, (2012); Sasaki, Kotaro, Core-protected platinum monolayer shell high-stability electrocatalysts for fuel-cell cathodes, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 49, 46, pp. 8602-8607, (2010); Nilekar, Anand Udaykumar, Mixed-metal Pt monolayer electrocatalysts with improved CO tolerance, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 133, 46, pp. 18574-18576, (2011); Adzic, Radoslav R., Platinum monolayer fuel cell electrocatalysts, Topics in Catalysis, 46, 3-4, pp. 249-262, (2007); Vukmirović, Miomir B., Electrodeposition of metals in catalyst synthesis: The case of platinum monolayer electrocatalysts, Electrochemical Society Interface, 20, 2, pp. 33-40, (2011)","","","","","","","","19327455; 19327447","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861935757"

The effect of charge current density on the electrochemical behavior of an electrode in KOH electrolyte without or with K <inf>2</inf>S additives was investigated. In KOH electrolyte, the discharge capacity increased in proportion to the logarithm of charge current density in the range of 10-40 mA cm -2. According to an analysis of Tafel plots of the electrodes, the hydrogen evolution was found to reach its diffusion limit earlier than the reduction reaction of Fe(OH) <inf>2</inf> to Fe as charge current density increased. This was deduced to be the reason for the increase of discharge capacity with current density. But as the density increased further, the discharge capacity decreased because both above reactions reached their diffusion limits.

Many studies of cosmic rays show that cosmic flux depends on the depth of atmosphere. At ground level, most secondary cosmic rays are muons, a type of charged particle, and have angular dependence. The purpose of this article was to develop the telescope with two plastic scintillation detectors to investigate the angular distribution of cosmic rays at ground level. Directions of investigation were carried out vertical, 45-degree oblique and horizontal directions with respect to earth surface, approximately from North to South. Electronic readout system was developed from Flash Analog Digital Converter (Flash-ADC) of 8 bits-250Ms/sec, and Embedded Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based trigger. LabVIEW™ interface was written for controlling trigger system and taking data. For each direction measurement, the deposited energy spectra in the scintillators were obtained. The interest of cosmic-ray events was analyzed for counting. Angular distribution was obtained quantitatively.

Wavelet coherence and coherence modes have been developed for mapping characteristics of spanwise coherence of pressure and turbulence. Temporal-spectral spanwise coherence maps have been represented in the time-frequency plane and spatial-spectral spanwise coherence maps have been expressed in the space-frequency plane. Some new findings are that spanwise pressure coherence not only depends on spanwise separation, frequency and turbulent conditions, but is also influenced by bluff body flow and time. Intermittent and time-dependent pressure coherence in the time domain has been investigated as the nature of pressure coherence. Furthermore, distribution and intermittency of pressure coherence are significantly influenced by analyzed time-frequency resolutions and parameters of the analyzed wavelet function. The coherence mode has been proposed for better understanding of the effect of bluff body flow on pressure coherence. Physical measurements of surface fluctuating pressure and turbulence have been carried out on typical prisms with slenderness ratios of B/. D=1 and 5 in turbulent flow. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coherence Map; Coherence Mode; Pressure Coherence; Pressure Field; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition; Wavelet Coherence; Wavelet Transform; Data Handling; Prisms; Turbulence; Wavelet Transforms; Coherence Maps; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Fluctuating Pressures; Pressure Field; Proper Orthogonal Decompositions; Time-frequency Planes; Time-frequency Resolution; Wavelet Coherences; Wavelet Decomposition","Data handling; Prisms; Turbulence; Wavelet transforms; Coherence maps; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Fluctuating pressures; Pressure field; Proper orthogonal decompositions; Time-frequency planes; Time-frequency resolution; Wavelet coherences; Wavelet decomposition","","","This study was funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan through the Global Center of Excellence Program, 2008–2012.

More specifically, no methodology exists to determine the effect that a partially destroyed armour layer would have on the overall stability of an armoured caisson breakwater. Although Esteban et al. (2008) developed a method to estimate the deformation of a caisson breakwater subjected to solitary wave attack, this method is known the be greatly influenced by the presence of an armour layer in front on the caisson. Thus, laboratory experiments with solitary waves were carried out to clarify the failure mechanism of an armoured caisson breakwater against a comprehensive range a tsunami type events (bore-type, breaking and non-breaking). The results of the experiments show how the load which is exerted by the caisson onto the foundation depends on the depth of water in front of it, the shape of the armour layer and whether the wave strikes the caisson or the armour layer first. Of particular interest, it was found how the presence of armour (in particular a failed or partially constructed armour layer) can sometimes be detrimental to the stability of the caisson itself.

A cyclic material flow with alternative usage of all materials in the loop is an essential feature of an eco-industrial network. While eco-industrial networking has been primarily applied on the high-tech sector, this paper attempts to apply the principles on the fishery sector of An Giang, a Vietnamese province in the Mekong River Delta. An Giang Province has its own market share in the trade of Tra and Basa fish. The industries in the value chain of Tra and Basa are in a situation that forces them to improve their competitiveness to retain the market share. It was found that forming an eco-industrial network and recruiting new businesses to utilize all materials in the process provides additional revenue apart from reducing waste disposal concerns. This paper details the current market situation, the issues faced and material flow patterns and presents a feasible eco-industrial network. The results of the study indicate that the eco-industrial network creates positive impacts in terms of increased competitiveness, improved socio-economic conditions and cleaner environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that the yield of methyl esters strongly depended on the amount of KOH and the molar ratio of methanol to triolein (M/T) and was highest at the M/T molar ratio of 6/1, KOH concentration of 1 wt% and irradiation time of 30 min. In addition, the effects of sonication on the methanolysis of triolein were discussed in comparison to the effects of stirring experiments. The optimum condition under stirring experiments showed that the molar ratio of M/T, KOH concentration and reaction time were 6/1, 1.5 wt% and 4 h, respectively. These results clearly indicated that the ultrasonic irradiation method would be a promising one compared to the conventional stirring method. The high yield under the ultrasonic irradiation condition would be due to high speed mixing and mass transfer between the methanol and triolein as well as the formation of a microemulsion resulting from the ultrasonic cavitation phenomenon. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a fact that when carrying out the determination of α and f at the PN-3 irradiation site of the JRR-3M research reactor (Tokai, Japan) using the KAYZERO software, unacceptable results were obtained from experiment to experiment for α ranging from 0.10 to 0.999 and franging from 70 to 9999. The ""Cd ratio"" for a gold monitor in the PN-3 site is about 300. These unacceptable results have indicated the need for the application of Cd methods that are based on ""Cd-covered"" irradiation and ""Cd-ratio"" measurements at certain suitable and available monitors. Such Cd methods have not been incorporated into the KAYZERO v4.0 software. Therefore, computational and experimental procedures of the ""Cd-covered"" method for α and the ""Cd-ratio"" method for f determination have been presented in this paper. The PN-2 irradiation site of the JRR-3M reactor where the neutron thermalization is not high has a Cd ratio for gold of about 26.

It mainly contains C<inf>5</inf>-C<inf>7</inf> paraffin, its RON is estimated to be less than 70, and the production of aromatics for petrochemicals and production of high-octane isomerate gasoline components would be recommended. Isomerate gasoline is environmentally acceptable for Vietnam because it can eliminate the leaded gasoline currently used. The plant design and isomerization process were studied and its construction cost was estimated. The total investment cost of a 5000 bpd isomerization plant is about Y200 million.

Finally, methods to increase the success of the single-phase auto-reclosing scheme also are investigated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electric Power Transmission; Autoreclosing; Capacitive And Inductive Couplings; Power System; Secondary Arc; Series Capacitors; Single Phase; Transmission Systems; Vietnamese; Digital Signal Processors","Electric power transmission; Autoreclosing; Capacitive and inductive couplings; Power System; Secondary arc; Series capacitors; Single phase; Transmission systems; Vietnamese; Digital signal processors","","","","Rapport 39 08 Cicre Session, (1984); Rapport 31 09 Cigre Session, (1974); Rapport 310 Cigre Session, (1962); Gary C, Self extinguishing tests for thin arcs in case of single- phase release.
