In addition, Facebook posts of the respective newspaper organisations were also analysed. This is a quantitative study and offers an extensive comparative overview of trends and patterns in media representation of the Games in different parts of the world. The results showed that the total number of articles and photographs varied greatly between countries and regions. Analysis of the Facebook posts showed a similar trend to newspapers. The subject of interest is predominantly still the male athletes, and particularly those competing in wheelchairs. In nearly all the publications sampled, media coverage featured more content of their local athletes than foreigners. Overall, there appears to be a great disparity in terms of coverage and content of the Paralympic Games between the 17 countries or regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research was supported by the Universiti Malaya Bantuan Kecil Penyelidikan BKP Grant (Grant no.

In the present study, we introduce an often-overlooked cultural factor – religiosity – to explore its influence on the relationship between being in love and five dimensions of subjective well-being. We conducted two cross-cultural studies with 31,608 participants from 117 samples across 83 societies. Our findings reveal that, in more religious cultures, being in love is a weaker predictor of well-being compared to more secular cultures in four out of six models. These findings indicate that national context influences the relative importance of various emotions and experiences for well-being, underscoring the need to account for cultural context in research on love. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Love; Religiosity; Well-being","","","","This work was supported by the Polish National Science Centre under grant 2020/38/E/HS6/00357 ; Hungarian OTKA Grant K-111 789 ; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development Grant 301298/2018-1 ; NPO \u201C Systemic Risk Institute \u201D Grant LX22NPO5101 funded by the European Union\u2013Next Generation EU (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, NPO: EXCELES, Czechia); University of Roma Department of Educational Studies Grant DSF 2017-2018 ; HSE University Basic Research Program; Ongoing Research Funding Program (ORF-2025-1204), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia ; ESRC grant number ES/W00786X/1 ; Ministry of Science, Technological Development, and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia ( 451-03-66/2024-03/200163 ).","Alarcon, Gene M., Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope, Personality and Individual Differences, 54, 7, pp. 821-827, (2013); Berkessel, Jana B., National religiosity eases the psychological burden of poverty, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 39, (2021); Boulis, Christopher, Religion as a Determinant of Relationship Stability, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 63, 2, pp. 281-306, (2024); Chen, Beiwen, Basic psychological need satisfaction, need frustration, and need strength across four cultures, Motivation and Emotion, 39, 2, pp. 216-236, (2015); Cherniak, Aaron D., Attachment theory and religion, Current Opinion in Psychology, 40, pp. 126-130, (2021); Young Children of Black Immigrants in America Changing Flows Changing Faces, (2012); undefined; Çukur, Cem Şafak, Religiosity, values, and horizontal and vertical individualism—collectivism: A study of turkey, the united states, and the philippines, Journal of Social Psychology, 144, 6, pp. 613-634, (2004); Deci, Edward L., The ""what"" and ""why"" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior, Psychological Inquiry, 11, 4, pp. 227-268, (2000); Diener, Edward F., The Satisfaction With Life Scale, Journal of Personality Assessment, 49, 1, pp. 71-75, (1985)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01471767","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009905086"

We hypothesized that individuals in romantic relationships would report higher well-being (measured as happiness, harmony, and meaning in life) compared to singles. We anticipated that in cultures prioritizing relationships, the benefits of being coupled would be amplified, while in societies emphasizing autonomy, the well-being gap would diminish. Specifically, we posited that values prevalent in WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic)–such as self-direction and achievement–would positively moderate the association between relationship status and well-being, whereas values characteristic of non-WEIRD societies–such as tradition and conformity–would have a negative moderating effect. Our findings support that coupled individuals generally report higher well-being; however, the moderating effects of cultural values were more complex than expected. Cultural classifications of WEIRD and non-WEIRD did not consistently explain the well-being gap. Interestingly, in cultures emphasizing conformity, single and coupled individuals both reported greater meaning, leading to an overall decrease in the well-being gap. Conversely, higher self-direction values were associated with a wider well-being gap, with singles experiencing decreased happiness and meaning. These findings suggest that values such as conformity and self-direction exert domain-specific effects on well-being, influenced by broader social context and individual perceptions. Our research highlights the necessity of integrating cultural and individual factors in well-being research to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the quality of life for singles and those in relationships. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Relationship Status; Schwartz Values; Singles; Well-being; Adult; Article; Cultural Anthropology; Cultural Value; Female; Happiness; Human; Love; Major Clinical Study; Male; Quality Of Life; Social Environment; Wellbeing","adult; article; cultural anthropology; cultural value; female; happiness; human; love; major clinical study; male; quality of life; social environment; wellbeing","","","The present research was supported by multiple funding sources.

The study is situated within the broader context of industrialization and sustainable development in emerging economies. It employs structural decomposition analysis using Vietnam’s national input–output tables for the years 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2023. The analysis decomposes changes in total output into technical effects and final demand effects, allowing for an evaluation of the relative contributions of sectoral productivity and demand side factors. The findings of the study indicate that the manufacturing and services sectors have been the primary drivers of economic growth, with the electrical and optical equipment, food, beverages and tobacco, and basic metals sectors demonstrating particularly strong performance. The factor of final demand, which is derived from consumption, investment, and exports, has played a dominant role in driving output. Notably, export-led manufacturing has experienced significant benefits due to Vietnam’s engagement in free trade agreements. It is noteworthy that the agriculture sector demonstrated a period of recovery between 2019 and 2023, driven by an increase in final demand. This study underscores the pivotal function of sectoral adaptability, trade openness, and strategic policy in maintaining inclusive economic development. It is evident that the phenomenon under scrutiny is not only indicative of vulnerabilities and opportunities but also shaped by global shocks, for example, the coronavirus pandemic. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emerging Economies; I-o Analysis; Sectoral Growth; Structural Transformation","","","","","Abbott, Philip C., Trade and Development: Lessons from Vietnam's Past Trade Agreements, World Development, 37, 2, pp. 341-353, (2009); Almeida, Lucas Milanez de Lima, Application of multivariate analysis as complementary instrument in studies about structural changes: An example of the multipliers in the US economy, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 53, pp. 189-207, (2020); Barker, Tom, Vietnam: The next asian Tiger?, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 47, pp. 96-118, (2019); Dempster, Gregory M., Structural change in the U.S. economy: 1850-1900, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 31, pp. 112-123, (2014); Dhahri, Sabrine, Foreign capital towards SDGs 1 & 2—Ending Poverty and hunger: The role of agricultural production, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 53, pp. 208-221, (2020); Dietzenbacher, Erik, Structural decomposition techniques: Sense and sensitivity, Economic Systems Research, 10, 4, pp. 307-324, (1998); Doré, Natalia Izelli, The role of human capital, structural change, and institutional quality on Brazil's economic growth over the last two hundred years (1822–2019), Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 66, pp. 1-12, (2023); Erumban, Abdul Azeez, Structural change and economic growth in India, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 51, pp. 186-202, (2019); Franke, Reiner, Structural change in the manufacturing sector and its impact on business-related services: An input-output study for Germany, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 16, 4, pp. 467-488, (2005); Freire, Clovis, Economic diversification: A model of structural economic dynamics and endogenous technological change, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 49, pp. 13-28, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277099","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011734724"

A combination of the emission model and financial model, along with secondary data, was adopted to simulate the environmental and economic impacts of three bus technologies (i.e. diesel buses, compressed natural gas buses, and electric buses). The environmental aspects were evaluated by setting the energy flow of CO<inf>2</inf> emission simulation, considering both direct and indirect emissions. The economic impacts of e-bus versus baseline diesel and CNG alternatives were estimated using the metric total cost of ownership (TCO) per km. We determined that although the mandatory e-bus program might represent a viable option when compared to the combustion alternatives from an environmental standpoint, e-buses are less appealing to bus companies due to their significantly lower cost-competitiveness under a traditional (current) business model. In contrast, a fleet leasing model brings large financial benefits to bus companies, increasing more probability of acceptability and intention of compliance from bus operators. Specifically, our analysis estimates that implementing the e-bus mandatory program with a new leasing model will result in a maximum of 47 %, 90, and 97 % emission removal in 2030, 2040, and 2050 respectively. In the same period, the TCO per km reduces a maximum of 41.8 %, 31.0 %, and 17.4 %, respectively, compared to the traditional business model. The findings can be valuable for cities, practitioners, and bus companies, aiding in a better understanding of the challenges and benefits of the bus leasing model in order to better plan for e-bus uptake in Vietnam. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Case Study; Electric Buses; Ghg Emissions; Total Cost Of Ownership","","","","This study is based on research supported by a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23K04063 ) and the VinUni (VUNI.CEI.FS_0001 Digital Twin Platform to Empower Communities towards an Eco-friendly and Heathy Future)","Amasawa, Eri, Environmental potential of reusing, renting, and sharing consumer products: Systematic analysis approach, Journal of Cleaner Production, 242, (2020); Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, (1997); undefined, (2019); Electric Vehicle Outlook, (2025); Electric Vehicle Outlook 2021, (2021); Bohnsack, RenÃ©, Business models for sustainable technologies: Exploring business model evolution in the case of electric vehicles, Research Policy, 43, 2, pp. 284-300, (2014); International Journal of Environmental Chemical Ecological Geological and Geophysical Engineering, (2016); Christensen, Thomas Budde, Can innovative business models overcome resistance to electric vehicles?

Therefore, identifying a cost-effective feeding mode can help farmers cope with this problem. This study compared the effects of two popular feeding modes, commercial feed and combination feed (mixing instant feed with agricultural byproducts), on the technical efficiency (TE) of small pig holders in Vietnam. The data envelopment analysis approach and meta-frontier were used to measure and compare the TE of commercial and combination feeds. Additionally, this study used a Tobit regression to analyze the factors affecting TE. TE was 75.06, 86.56, and 78.76% with the meta-frontier, commercial, and combination feeding group frontiers, respectively. The corresponding meta-technology ratios of these groups were 83.89 and 97.24%, respectively, indicating that the TE of the combined feeding mode is higher than that of the commercial feeding mode. This finding confirms the economics of combination feed in the context of increasing the import price of raw materials for feed production. The results of the Tobit models show that the education of household heads, access to credit, pig density, family income, herd size, and percentage of own-produced piglets are determinants of TE. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Envelopment Analysis; Feeding Mode; Meta Frontier; Pig Production; Technical Efficiency; Feeding Behavior; Instrumentation; Pig; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Technical Efficiency; Hanoi; Viet Nam","feeding behavior; instrumentation; pig; spatiotemporal analysis; technical efficiency; Hanoi; Viet Nam","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.01-2021.47.

To address the potential endogeneity of IPV, we employed the mother-in-law’s IPV history as an instrumental variable (IV) and analyzed data from the National Survey on Domestic Violence against Women in Vietnam. We found that a one standard deviation increase in the IPV index was associated with a significant increase in the use of medication (36.1%) and outpatient visits (37.4%). Further analysis showed that these effects varied based on women’s and their husbands’ education, place of residence, and ethnicity. Mechanism analysis showed that IPV negatively impacted women’ health, potentially leading to increased healthcare utilization. These findings highlight the detrimental consequences of IPV on women’s health and healthcare utilization in the Vietnamese context, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions that address the diverse experiences of women and the social factors influencing healthcare access in the face of IPV. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestic Violence; Health; Healthcare Utilization; Instrumental Variable; Intimate Partner Violence; Vietnam","","","","","undefined, (2013); Bhattacharya, Haimanti, Spousal Violence and Women's Employment in India, Feminist Economics, 21, 2, pp. 30-52, (2015); Bonomi, Amy E., Health care utilization and costs associated with physical and nonphysical-only intimate partner violence, Health Services Research, 44, 3, pp. 1052-1067, (2009); Bound, John, The dynamic effects of health on the labor force transitions of older workers, Labour Economics, 6, 2, pp. 179-202, (1999); Bui, Quang Nhat, The effect of domestic violence against women on child welfare in Vietnam, Children and Youth Services Review, 94, pp. 709-719, (2018); Chen, Lu, The hidden cost of informal care: An empirical study on female caregivers’ subjective well-being, Social Science and Medicine, 224, pp. 85-93, (2019); Coll, Carolina De Vargas Nunes, Intimate partner violence in 46 low-income and middle-income countries: An appraisal of the most vulnerable groups of women using national health surveys, BMJ Global Health, 5, 1, (2020); Dang, Truc Ngoc Hoang, Socioeconomic Inequalities in Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence from Vietnam, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 40, 1-2, pp. 31-55, (2025); Estimation and Inference in Econometrics, (1993); Devries, Karen M., Violence against women is strongly associated with suicide attempts: Evidence from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women, Social Science and Medicine, 73, 1, pp. 79-86, (2011)","","Springer","","","","","","15737152; 15695239","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003941165"

This study aims to yield a novel BC modification method using glycerol and succinic acid with catalyst and heat, applied via an industrially scalable padding method to tackle BC’s stiffness drawbacks and enhance BC properties. Design/methodology/approach: Fabric-like BC is generated via mechanical dehydration and then finished by using padding method with glycerol, succinic acid, catalyst and heat. Comprehensive material characterizations, including international testing standards for stiffness, bending properties (cantilever method), tensile properties, moisture vapor transmission rate, moisture content and regain, washing, thermal gravimetric analysis, derivative thermogravimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and colorimetric measurement, are used. Findings: The combination of BC/glycerol/succinic acid dramatically enhanced porous structure, elongation (27.40 ± 6.39%), flexibility (flexural rigidity of 21.46 ± 4.01 µN m; bending modulus of 97.45 ± 18.20 MPa) and moisture management (moisture vapor transmission rate of 961.07 ± 86.16 g/m2/24 h; moisture content of 27.43 ± 2.50%; and moisture regain of 37.94 ± 4.73%). This softening process modified the thermal stability of BC. Besides, this study alleviated the drawbacks for washing (five cycles) of BC and glycerol caused by the ineffective affinity between glycerol and cellulose by adding succinic acid with catalyst and heat. Originality/value: The study yields an effective padding process for BC softening and a unique modified BC to contribute added value to textile and leather industries as a sustainable alternative to existing materials and a premise for future research on BC functionalization by using doable technologies in mass production as padding. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial Cellulose; Glycerol; Padding; Softening; Succinic Acid; Textile Finishing","","","","The authors acknowledge Kyoto Institute of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for supporting this study.

Four types of prototype flux-cored wires with different sodium contents in the flux were fabricated. By using these wires, the influence mechanism of sodium on the metal transfer behavior was elucidated through shadowgraph measurements of the metal transfer behavior as well as spectroscopic and color image observations of the arc characteristics. It was found that the metal transfer between 190 A and 310 A was in the projected transfer mode and could be further classified into two sub-modes (type A and type B) based on the droplet formation process. A larger droplet was formed on the side of flux column in type A, while a smaller one was formed in the center covering the flux in type B. The metal transfer frequency became larger in the latter case for the same wire feeding speed. Type A tended to dominate in the lower current and lower sodium content conditions, while type B dominated in the opposite conditions. The dominant sub-mode was determined to depend on the Lorentz force acting on the droplet. At medium currents (250 A and 280 A), both sub-modes appeared in similar proportions. The maximum metal transfer frequency occurred at a particular sodium content. When the sodium content was smaller or larger, type A or type B became dominant, respectively. The sodium content at which the maximum frequency occurred decreased when the current increased. In type A, the iron plasma was widely distributed on the droplet side of the flux, while the sodium plasma was concentrated near the flux on the opposite side, so both were separated. In contrast, in type B, the sodium plasma was concentrated around the flux at the center and the iron plasma was widely distributed in the arc column, so both overlapped around the center. Sodium has a low boiling point and low ionization potential. In type A, the sodium vapor greatly increased the electrical conductivity of plasma around the flux column, so part of the current flowed from the wire through the sodium plasma to the weld pool. Accordingly, the current flowing through the bottom of the droplet to the arc decreased, leading to a lower arc pressure and recoil pressure under the droplet, and causing the metal transfer frequency to increase with sodium content. On the other hand, in type B, the sodium vaporization increased around the center, increasing the recoil pressure. In addition, the current density at the bottom of the droplet increased due to the current concentration in the arc, causing the arc pressure to rise. Therefore, the metal transfer frequency tended to decrease with sodium content. Due to the balance of these factors, the metal transfer frequency has a maximum at a particular sodium content. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfer; Sodium Vapor; Alkali Metals; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide Arc Welding; Concentration (process); Drop Wires; Inert Gas Welding; Inert Gases; Ionization Potential; Iron; Metal Insulator Transition; Phosphorus; Sodium Metallography; Submerged Arc Welding; X Ray Absorption Spectroscopy; 'current; Alkali-elements; Arc Pressure; Arc-welding; Condition; Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfer Frequency; Metal Transfers; Recoil Pressure; Sodium Vapors; Flux-cored Arc Welding (fcaw)","Alkali metals; Carbon; Carbon dioxide arc welding; Concentration (process); Drop wires; Inert gas welding; Inert gases; Ionization potential; Iron; Metal insulator transition; Phosphorus; Sodium metallography; Submerged arc welding; X ray absorption spectroscopy; 'current; Alkali-elements; Arc pressure; Arc-welding; Condition; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfer frequency; Metal transfers; Recoil pressure; Sodium vapors; Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW)","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University .","undefined, (2004); undefined, (2022); Świerczyńska, Aleksandra, Exploring the trends in flux-cored arc welding: scientometric analysis approach, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 130, 1-2, pp. 87-110, (2024); Yu, Jiyoung, Metal-cored welding wire for minimizing weld porosity of zinc-coated steel, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 249, pp. 350-357, (2017); French, Ian E., Comparison of pulsed and conventional welding with basic flux cored and metal cored welding wires, Welding Journal, 74, 6, (1995); Bauné, E., Assessing metal transfer stability and spatter severity in flux cored arc welding, Science and Technology of Welding and Joining, 6, 3, pp. 139-148, (2001); Lu, Fenggui, Analysis of energy flow in gas metal arc welding processes through self-consistent three-dimensional process simulation, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 68, pp. 215-223, (2014); Soderstrom, E.

This paper presents a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) approach to solve the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in microgrids, focusing on the combined use of RES, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and Incentive-Based Demand Response (IBDR) programs. The proposed model optimizes power generation scheduling for both grid-connected and isolated microgrid modes. To assess customer satisfaction in IBDR programs, a Fuzzy Logic Model evaluates key factors like load demand, freedom of time, electricity prices, and incentives. This model aims to minimize operating costs when IBDR is not applied or maximize social welfare when IBDR is implemented. Results, obtained using Matlab/Simulink for customer satisfaction modeling and the CPLEX solver in Python for UC optimization, demonstrate that integrating BESS and IBDR enhances system flexibility and resilience to RES fluctuations. In optimal grid-connected operation, the model achieves a 22.27% reduction in operating costs and a 28.95% increase in social welfare compared to isolated operations.

Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with Central Composite Design (CCD) was employed to optimize the cultivation conditions for Brassica juncea using the composted fertilizer. Results demonstrated that Trichoderma spp. significantly accelerated decomposition and improved fertilizer quality. Among the tested parameters, composting duration and fertilization rate significantly influenced plant growth, particularly leaf length and width, while microbial inoculant concentration had no notable effect. Microbial analysis confirmed that Coliform, E. coli, and Salmonella levels were below regulatory limits (ND 108/2017/ND-CP), with none detected in fertilizers produced with Trichoderma spp.. RSM optimization identified the optimal composting conditions as 18 days, 4 wt.% Trichoderma spp., and 50 v/v% fertilizer volume fraction. A high-accuracy mathematical model was developed to predict plant growth responses, effectively forecasting the impact of composting parameters on crop development.

Although the source of the disease is difficult to trace, understanding how it occurs is important to mitigate the problem. A crucial factor that has not received sufficient attention is the presence of spillovers among fish farmers connected by waterways. This study examines the presence of spillovers among shrimp farmers in Southern Vietnam based on primary data. In particular, it quantifies the effects of contaminated water spillovers from one farm to another and the peer effects of farming practices among neighbors. We solve the reflection problem by employing a method developed in social network analyses. The findings indicate that a farmer's practices are affected by their neighbors’ farming practices. Further, the disease outbreak in a farmer's pond is affected by those in their neighbors’ ponds, even after controlling for contextual peer effects and correlated effects. The negative effects of neighbors’ ponds on the probability of disease outbreaks in a farmer's pond may offset the positive effects of the farmer's good farming practices, suggesting the importance of considering neighboring farmers as a group when addressing the issue of disease control. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Peer Effect; Shrimp Farming; Spillover; Vietnam; Aquaculture System; Disease Prevalence; Shrimp Culture; Social Network; Spillover Effect; Water Pollution; Viet Nam","aquaculture system; disease prevalence; shrimp culture; social network; spillover effect; water pollution; Viet Nam","","","We thank the journal editor and three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, our farmers for their cooperation in our survey, and our enumerators for their excellent job in collecting valuable data.

Using a cross-sectional dataset of 330 manufacturing plants from the 4th round of the High-Performance Manufacturing Project, we tested the proposed relationships through moderation analysis. The results indicate that psychological safety has a strong positive impact on improvement capability, particularly in the improvement dimension. Unexpectedly, the findings do not support the moderating effect of manufacturing complexity on the relationship between psychological safety and improvement capability. However, a post hoc analysis reveals that product complexity negatively moderates the relationship between psychological safety and the improvement dimension, suggesting that the effect of psychological safety on the improvement dimension is less salient under conditions of high product complexity. Our findings contribute to continuous improvement and psychological safety literature in two ways: (1) by integrating continuous improvement literature and positive organizational scholarship to empirically examine the facilitating role of psychological safety on improvement capability, and (2) by empirically investigating the efficacious of psychological safety in facilitating improvement capability across different levels of manufacturing complexity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High-performance Manufacturing; Improvement Capability; Manufacturing Complexity; Process Complexity; Product Complexity; Psychological Safety","","","","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) numbers JP19H01520 and JP22H00874.","Agostini, Lara, Organizational and managerial challenges in the path toward Industry 4.0, European Journal of Innovation Management, 22, 3, pp. 406-421, (2019); Ahmad, Sohel, The impact of human resource management practices on operational performance: Recognizing country and industry differences, Journal of Operations Management, 21, 1, pp. 19-43, (2003); Ahmed, Pervaiz Khalid, Culture and climate for innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 1, 1, pp. 30-43, (1998); Ahmed, Pervaiz Khalid, Cultures for continuous improvement and learning, Total Quality Management, 10, 4-5, pp. 426-434, (1999); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Almaatouq, Abdullah, Task complexity moderates group synergy, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 36, (2021); Anand, Gopesh, Dynamic capabilities through continuous improvement infrastructure, Journal of Operations Management, 27, 6, pp. 444-461, (2009); Ateş, Melek Akın, Order from chaos: A meta-analysis of supply chain complexity and firm performance, Journal of Supply Chain Management, 58, 1, pp. 3-30, (2022); Bello Pintado, Alejandro, Process control and quality performance: the role of shop-floor leadership practices, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 31, 7-8, pp. 829-846, (2020); Beraldin, Andrea Roberto, Employee involvement for continuous improvement and production repetitiveness: a contingency perspective for achieving organisational outcomes, Production Planning and Control, 33, 4, pp. 323-339, (2022)","","Springer","","","","","","19369743; 19369735","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214442841"

There is then an argument that firms should address the SDGs by applying the creating shared value (CSV) framework. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is nothing more than “business as usual” implemented in the name of the SDGs, or so-called SDG-washing, thereby limiting firm contributions to the SDGs. Although the SDG Compass, the most referenced business guideline on SDGs, currently encourages firms to address the SDGs using their economic motivation, it is uncertain whether it provides the right direction for achieving them. The purpose of this study is to address whether the economic motivation of firms to achieve the SDGs is practically preferable in contrast to the ethical motivation. Using data on Japanese and Vietnamese firms, we empirically analyse whether the degree of a firm’s proactiveness to address the SDGs depends on its economic and/or ethical motivations from a stakeholder management perspective. Our estimation results clarify that an ethical motivation continues to play a more significant role for firms in addressing the SDGs. Put differently, while CSV appears an attractive framework for firms to address the SDGs, its actual contribution remains partial and tentative, and it has thus been criticized for overemphasizing any economic motivation that potentially promotes SDG-washing. It is important to note that this could also ultimately decrease economic value by harming the firm’s reputation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Creating Shared Value; Economic And Ethical Motivations; Sdg-washing; Sustainability Management; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs)","","","","Open Access funding provided by Kobe University.","Aguado, Elisabet, Differences of corporate environmental responsibility in Small and Medium Enterprises: Spain and Norway, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 6, (2018); Arco-Castro, Maria Lourdes, Corporate philanthropy and employee engagement, Review of Managerial Science, 14, 4, pp. 705-725, (2020); Baah, Charles, Examining the correlations between stakeholder pressures, green production practices, firm reputation, environmental and financial performance: Evidence from manufacturing SMEs, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 100-114, (2021); Bassetti, Thomas, The management of sustainable development: A longitudinal analysis of the effects of environmental performance on economic performance, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 1, pp. 21-37, (2021); Bilderback, Stephanie L., Integrating training for organizational sustainability: the application of Sustainable Development Goals globally, European Journal of Training and Development, 48, 7-8, pp. 730-748, (2024); Blanco-González, Alicia, Contribution of social responsibility to the work involvement of employees, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 6, pp. 2588-2598, (2020); Blasi, Silvia, A Multidimensional Analysis of the Relationship Between Corporate Social Responsibility and Firms' Economic Performance, Ecological Economics, 147, pp. 218-229, (2018); Bose, Sudipta, What drives green banking disclosure?

While prior research has acknowledged the role of relationships in facilitating collaboration, few studies have considered inter-personal and inter-organisational attributes simultaneously. This study addresses this gap by investigating these two levels of the manufacturer-supplier relationship in Vietnam’s fishery industry and their impacts on supply chain collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a quantitative approach. A questionnaire was distributed to 635 fishery manufacturers in Vietnam by the drop-and-collect method. EFA and CFA were used to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement model, while CB-SEM was employed for structural model assessment and hypothesis testing. Findings: Supply chain collaboration encompasses incentive alignment, collaborative communication, decision synchronisation, and information sharing. All antecedents, including commitment, inter-organisational trust, reciprocity, and inter-personal trust, positively affect collaboration. Inter-personal trust positively influences the other antecedents, and inter-organisational trust enhances commitment. Furthermore, there are partial mediating effects among these relationship attributes. However, no significant moderating effect regarding firm size is observed. Originality/value: The study extends the social exchange theory to encompass both inter-personal and inter-organisational relationship attributes. Additionally, it pioneers in investigating the interrelatedness of these antecedents.

Data were collected using questionnaire survey, including a sample of 159 Vietnamese respondents living in Vietnam and having WFH experience. Data analysis techniques include measurement tests and regression analysis for hypothesis testing using SPSS software. The findings indicate that WFH significantly enhances positive work-to-family spillover (PWFS) and WFS has a notable impact on IRJP. Specifically, PWFS enhances IRJP by encouraging outward-focused thought-action patterns, whereas negative work-to-family spillover (NWFS) reduces IRJP by promoting inward-focused thought-action patterns. Nevertheless, the direct influence of WFH on IRJP and the moderating role of EI could not be verified. Theoretically, this study enhances JD-R theory and broaden and build theory by demonstrating that WFH serves as a resource positively influencing PWFS and confirming the significant impact of WFS on IRJP. Practically, the paper suggests that organizations should adopt WFH practices and focus on some human resource management policies to enhance PWFS and decrease NWFS, thereby boosting employee performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emotional Intelligence; In-role Job Performance; Work From Home; Work-to-family Spillover","","","","","Abendroth, Anja Kristin, Support for the work-life balance in europe: The impact of state, workplace and family support on work-life balance satisfaction, Work, Employment and Society, 25, 2, pp. 234-256, (2011); Aksoy, Cevat Giray, Working from Home Around the World, CESifo Forum, 23, 6, pp. 38-41, (2022); Allen, Tammy D., How effective is telecommuting?

GHG emissions are a major driver of climate change, leading to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and ecosystem degradation, while air pollutants exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. Furthermore, these emissions elevate healthcare costs, diminish labor productivity, and require substantial remediation efforts. Consequently, reducing emissions is vital for sustainable development. When emission reductions correlate with increased profitability, firms and investors are motivated to engage in climate change mitigation, underscoring the need to understand the interplay between a firm’s emissions and its performance in informing emissions reduction strategies. This study primarily aims to investigate the causal relationship between a firm’s emissions and its financial performance, examining whether emission reductions can improve profitability and thereby create financial incentives for firms and investors to adopt more sustainable practices. Using firm-level data spanning 2005 to 2021 across several African countries, the analysis provides empirical insights into this linkage. GHG emissions and air pollutants serve as proxies for firm emissions, based on data from the S&P Capital IQ Pro-Environmental Package. To analyze the dynamic and causal relationship between emissions and financial performance, we apply a panel vector autoregression (VAR) model. Our results indicate a bidirectional causality between these variables, evident across various emissions measures. Specifically, we find that firm emissions have a significant negative impact on financial performance, while enhanced financial performance contributes to a reduction in emissions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollutants; Corporate Financial Performance; Environmental Performance; Ghg Emissions; Panel Var","","","","","Galati, Antonino, A feasibility analysis on adopting electric vehicles in the short food supply chain based on GHG emissions and economic costs estimations, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 36, pp. 49-61, (2023); Le, Hai, Assessing the impact of environmental performance on corporate financial performance: A firm-level study of GHG emissions in Africa, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 47, pp. 644-654, (2024); Liang, Zhenghao, Combination of organic fertilizer and slow-release fertilizer increases pineapple yields, agronomic efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions under reduced fertilization conditions in tropical areas, Journal of Cleaner Production, 343, (2022); Alahmad, Barrak K., Connections Between Air Pollution, Climate Change, and Cardiovascular Health, Canadian Journal of Cardiology, 39, 9, pp. 1182-1190, (2023); Liao, Minyu, Sex differences in particulate air pollution-related cardiovascular diseases: A review of human and animal evidence, Science of the Total Environment, 884, (2023); Luo, Huihuan, Air Pollution and Cardiac Arrest: A More Significant Intermediate Role of COPD than Cardiac Events, Environmental Science and Technology, 58, 18, pp. 7782-7790, (2024); Ferrat, Yann J., Carbon emissions and firm performance: A matter of horizon, materiality and regional specificities, Journal of Cleaner Production, 329, (2021); Blind, Knut, The influence of regulations on innovation: A quantitative assessment for OECD countries, Research Policy, 41, 2, pp. 391-400, (2012); Lawson, Laté Ayao, GHG emissions and fossil energy use as consequences of efforts of improving human well-being in Africa, Journal of Environmental Management, 273, (2020); Porter, Michael E., Towards a dynamic theory of strategy, Strategic Management Journal, 12, 2 S, pp. 95-117, (1991)","Kot, S.; Khalid, B.; ul Haque, A.","Springer Nature","","4th Global Conference on Entrepreneurship and Economy in an Era of Uncertainty, EEEU 2024","","Da Nang","333849","21987254; 21987246","9783031900532; 9789819665259; 9783319338637; 9783031766572; 9783030552763; 9783030305482; 9783031065804; 9783031261206; 9783030506759; 9789811678172","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009404873"

However, the upper flange must be reinforced from below due to the presence of slabs on the upper surface. Recently, carbon fiber has been used as a reinforcement material, but the vertical stiffeners installed beneath the upper flange hinder the continuous application of carbon fiber along the girder axis. The study proposed a reinforcement method for the underside of the upper flange, even in areas with vertical stiffeners, by bonding CFRP molded plate with notches designed to bypass the vertical stiffeners. Bending tests were performed on steel girder specimens reinforced using the proposed method to evaluate the reinforcement effect. As a result, a reduction in stress on the upper flange was confirmed, even at locations where the vertical stiffener was present. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bending Test; Bond; Cfrp Molded Plate; Reinforcement; Steel Girder; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics; Carbon Fibers; Flanges; Plates (structural Components); Steel Beams And Girders; Bond; Cfrp Molded Plate; Large-scales; Reinforcement Materials; Reinforcement Method; Replacement Projects; Steel Girder; Upper Flanges; Upper Surface; Vertical Stiffeners; Bending Tests","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Flanges; Plates (structural components); Steel beams and girders; Bond; CFRP molded plate; Large-scales; Reinforcement materials; Reinforcement method; Replacement projects; Steel girder; Upper flanges; Upper surface; Vertical stiffeners; Bending tests","","","","West Nippon Expressway Company Limited Long Term Maintenance and Renewal of Highway Assets Report Technical Committee on Long Term Maintenance and Renewal of Highway Assets, (2014); Composite Structure Series, (2021); Japan Society of Steel Construction Inspection Diagnosis and Countermeasure Technologies for Civil Engineering Steel Structures Revised 2009 Edition, (2009); Guidelines for Repair and Strengthening of Structures Using Externally Bonded Frp, (2018); Pham, Ngoc Vinh, Seismic Retrofitting Method Using CFRP Sheets for H-Section Steel Beam with Variable Cross Section, Journal of Structural Engineering, 148, 4, (2022); J Jpn Soc Civ Eng, (2015)","","International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE)","BBR VT International and AQUILA Built Health; East Japan Railway Company - Structural Engineering Center; East Nippon Expressway Company Limited/Central Nippon Expressway Company Limited/West Nippon Expressway Company Limited; et al.; IHI Infrastructure Systems Co., Ltd.; Yokogawa Bridge Corp.","IABSE Symposium Tokyo 2025: Environmentally Friendly Technologies and Structures: Focusing on Sustainable Approaches","","Tokyo; Waseda University and the RIHGA Royal Hotel","209394","","9783857482069","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008751620"

Based on data collected from Vietnamese firms, the study employs regression analysis and PROCESS macro with a bootstrap method. Analytical results illustrate that quality management shows a significant effect on economic, environmental, and social bottom lines with or without the mediating role of supply chain management. The direct impact of supply chain management on those performances is insignificant, but it becomes significant with the mediating effect of quality management. Quality management seems to be a prerequisite for an effective supply chain quality model regarding sustainability. Moreover, the concurrence of supply chain and quality management results in a conflictual effect on economic return, although some possible synergy could be found among individual practices. It sheds light on the efficient resource allocation to achieve a certain level of balance in achieving sustainable goals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Country; Scqm; Supply Chain Quality Management; Tbl; Triple Bottom Line","","","","This research is partially funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Abbas, Jawad, Impact of total quality management on corporate sustainability through the mediating effect of knowledge management, Journal of Cleaner Production, 244, (2020); Ageron, Blandine, Sustainable supply management: An empirical study, International Journal of Production Economics, 140, 1, pp. 168-182, (2012); Alsawafi, Ahmed, The impacts of internal quality management relations on the triple bottom line: A dynamic capability perspective, International Journal of Production Economics, 232, (2021); Ali AlShehail, Ohoud, Total quality management and sustainability in the public service sector: the mediating effect of service innovation, Benchmarking, 29, 2, pp. 382-410, (2022); Apornak, Arash, Extension of the model of manufacturing supply chain quality management: An empirical study, International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management, 28, 4, pp. 417-437, (2019); History of Total Quality Management TQM, (2013); Bhatia, Manjot Singh, Green supply chain management: Scientometric review and analysis of empirical research, Journal of Cleaner Production, 284, (2021); Birkel, Hendrik, Potentials of industry 4.0 for supply chain management within the triple bottom line of sustainability – A systematic literature review, Journal of Cleaner Production, 289, (2021); Carter, Craig R., A framework of sustainable supply chain management: Moving toward new theory, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 38, 5, pp. 360-387, (2008); Baumann-Chardine, Émilie, A framework for sustainable performance assessment of supply chain management practices, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 76, 1, pp. 138-147, (2014)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","1741816X; 14606739","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004222911"

While businesses aim to establish optimal dividend policies to balance reinvestment and shareholder satisfaction, investors are drawn to attractive policies that promise tangible returns. The dividend policies of 74 manufacturing businesses listed on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (HOSE) are examined in this study in three different time periods: before COVID-19 (2018–2019), during COVID-19 (2020–2021), and after COVID-19 (2022). The research focuses on five key variables: the previous year’s cash dividend payout ratio (DPR), earnings per share (EPS), return on assets (ROA), revenue growth rate, and liquidity. Utilizing panel data regression models and SPSS 26 software, the findings reveal that four out of the five variables significantly affect dividend policy, though their impact varies across different phases. Notably, the previous year’s DPR consistently exerts the strongest influence, while EPS and ROA also play pivotal roles. The revenue growth rate negatively impacts dividend policy during the pre-pandemic period but loses significance during the pandemic.

The Kuznets curve, which is a well-known inverted U-shaped relationship between real per capita GDP and income inequality, was found by applying the robust fixed-effects method (FEM). In Vietnam during 2004 (Formula presented.) 2021, economic growth first increased income inequality and later reduced it at a higher stage of economic development. This empirical evidence demonstrates that the Kuznets curve is an apparent empirical phenomenon in both national and provincial data. The Two-step System GMM Estimation examined the impact of income inequality and other socioeconomic factors on GDP per capita and showed the significant positive impact of income inequality, investment, employment rate, and education attainment, as well as a significant negative impact of headline inflation and the urbanization rate on economic development. Moreover, the results show that not literacy rate but educational attainment (the percentage of the population aged 15 years and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher) significantly influence economic growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Development; Gini; Gmm; Income Inequality; Vietnam; Economic Development; Economic Growth; Empirical Analysis; Gross Domestic Product; Income; Inflation; Panel Data; Urbanization; Viet Nam","economic development; economic growth; empirical analysis; Gross Domestic Product; income; inflation; panel data; urbanization; Viet Nam","","","We wish to express our gratitude to Prof. Hiroshi Suzuki for helpful suggestions.

Leveraging the variation in the degree of ICT development among provinces as a source of exogenous variation, we employ fixed effects models. Our findings provide evidence that ICT improves the chances of obtaining contracted jobs for married women, particularly those who are low-educated, belong to minor ethnic groups, and are relatively older individuals aged 40 to 55. The rise in contract jobs for these groups suggests that ICT development has improved the local labor market and enhanced the job-matching process for vulnerable women in Vietnam. Additionally, we explore the well-being of households led by married women in contractual employment, revealing a positive correlation between the ICT development and average daily caloric intake per capita in such households. Our pathway emphasizes the synergy of ICT deployment, expanded contractual opportunities, and improved caloric intake. Furthermore, the results indicate a reduction in working hours for married women in contractual positions as a result of ICT development, suggesting ICT’s role in enhancing time management and work efficiency, thereby positively impacting household well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contract Job; Female Employment; Ict; Vhlss; Vietnam; Correlation; Ethnic Minority; Information And Communication Technology; Labor Market; Quality Of Life; Womens Employment; Viet Nam","correlation; ethnic minority; information and communication technology; labor market; quality of life; womens employment; Viet Nam","","","The second author received a grant for the research (JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number 18K01649).","Abbas, Khizar, Assessing an empirical relationship between energy poverty and domestic health issues: A multidimensional approach, Energy, 221, (2021); Aker, Jenny C., Dial ""A"" for agriculture: A review of information and communication technologies for agricultural extension in developing countries, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 42, 6, pp. 631-647, (2011); Appiah-Otoo, Isaac, The impact of ICT on economic growth-Comparing rich and poor countries, Telecommunications Policy, 45, 2, (2021); Simplice, Asongu Anutechia, The impact of mobile phone penetration on African inequality, International Journal of Social Economics, 42, 8, pp. 706-716, (2015); Atasoy, Hilal, The effects of broadband internet expansion on labor market outcomes, ILR Review, 66, 2, pp. 315-345, (2013); Mobile Broadband Internet Poverty and Labor Outcomes in Tanzania, (2021); Balsmeier, Benjamin, Is this time different?

In more detail, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of witnessing others’ i-deals on coworker’s emotional response (malicious envy), and the moderating effect of individualistic values on that response at both individual and national level. In addition, this study examines the impact of two types of witnessing others’ i-deals which include not only the other’s i-deals that the coworker directly observes, but also the generalized others’ i-deals which is an aggregated perception as a result of frequent observation of idiosyncratic deals enjoyed by multiple others. Data were collected from 450 employees from 5 Asian countries at two points. We adopted a hierarchical linear model (HLM) because we assume two levels for both i-deals and individualism. The results show that witnessing other’s i-deals is positively related to malicious envy. In addion, individual-level individualism was found to moderate the relationship between witnessing coworkers’ i-deals and malicious envy. Interestingly, it is not individualism at the country level, but that at the individual level that moderates the relationship between witnessing i-deals and malicious envy. This study indicates that i-deals studies on coworkers’ reactions to others’ i-deals should focus more on the moderating effect of individual cultural values. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coworker Reactions; Idiosyncratic Deals; Individualism; Malicious Envy","","","","","Social Psychology Quarterly, (1993); Matthijs Bal, P.

Most recent text generation models have mainly utilized the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and achieved promising results. However, while working on this problem, we observed that important indicators like salient words and sentences from downstream generation tasks can still be useful and beneficial for enhancing the performance. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring and investigating the contribution of auxiliary supervised learning tasks to improve the performance of PLMs for text generation. To this end, we observe the nature of text generation under three scenarios: incomplete utterance restoration, question generation, and summarization. The observation suggests that the indicators can be beneficial for text generation. We reflect this nature by defining a set of auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we design a model that considers both auxiliary tasks and the main text generation task under the joint training manner. The efficiency of the model is validated in the three generation scenarios. The results of the extensive experiments on 10 datasets for the three scenarios and languages show that the auxiliary tasks significantly contribute to improving the performance of PLMs for the main generation task. The ablation study facilitates the next studies of text generation by showing the behavior of the model in different settings. The model is simple, effective, and flexible for other text generation tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auxiliary Tasks; Joint Training; Pre-trained Language Models; Text Generation; Self-supervised Learning; Auxiliary Task; Down-stream; Joint Training; Language Model; Language Processing; Natural Languages; Performance; Power; Pre-trained Language Model; Text Generations","Self-supervised learning; Auxiliary task; Down-stream; Joint training; Language model; Language processing; Natural languages; Performance; Power; Pre-trained language model; Text generations","","","This work was supported by Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam, under the grant number B2024-SKH-01.","Ouyang, Long, Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, (2022); Yu, Wenhao, A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Text Generation, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 11 s, (2022); IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (2023); Yuan, Weizhe, BARTSCORE: Evaluating Generated Text as Text Generation, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 27263-27277, (2021); Pan, Zhufeng, Improving open-domain dialogue systems via multi-turn incomplete utterance restoration, pp. 1824-1833, (2019); Inoue, Shumpei, Enhance Incomplete Utterance Restoration by Joint Learning Token Extraction and Text Generation, pp. 3149-3158, (2022); Jia, Xin, How to ask good questions?

Various strategies are explored, including recycling inorganic waste and converting organic waste into energy. Landfill gas recovery is identified as a significant contributor to reducing toxic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and methane (CH₄) emissions. Furthermore, treating organic waste reduces landfill volume and minimizes the release of pollutants. The study emphasizes the importance of supportive policies for effective solid waste management and highlights how organic waste treatment can improve waste management in Nasinu Town.

Firstly, the sub-optimal distribution of data points within the latent space makes normal behavioral regions verbose and indistinguishable from abnormal regions. Secondly, within the latent space, it can be difficult to identify meaningful, separable, and indicative features. Finally, the processing time at the inference stage is still relatively slow. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of network anomaly detection mechanisms by proposing two novel deep hierarchical representation learning models: Deep Nested Clustering Auto-Encoder (DNCAE) and Deep Clustering Hierarchical Auto-Encoder (DCHAE). Both models adopt a nested branch structure, utilizing dual deep auto-encoders to establish hierarchical latent spaces; in each, clustering algorithms are used to spatially optimize and refine the data points. This approach results in improved separation between normal and abnormal data points, and easier identification of notable and/or indicative features. To ascertain the effectiveness of the approach and the quality of resulting features, both models were used in conjunction with ten different one-class anomaly detectors. Each of these ten anomaly detectors was evaluated on popular network intrusion datasets, notably: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS-2018, and CTU13. Experimental results have confirmed that both of the proposed models produced higher levels of accuracy than existing baselines and current state-of-the-art models. Additionally, the processing time at the inference stage shows a significant reduction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; Cyber-attack Detection; Deep Clustering; Deep Learning; Latent Representation; Anomaly Detection; Computer Crime; Crime; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Network Security; Signal Encoding; Attack Detection; Auto Encoders; Clusterings; Cybe-attack Detection; Cyber-attacks; Datapoints; Deep Clustering; Latent Representation; Clustering Algorithms","Anomaly detection; Computer crime; Crime; Deep learning; Learning systems; Network security; Signal encoding; Attack detection; Auto encoders; Clusterings; Cybe-attack detection; Cyber-attacks; Datapoints; Deep clustering; Latent representation; Clustering algorithms","","","","Khang, Alex, Preface, (2023); Aslan, Omer, A Comprehensive Review of Cyber Security Vulnerabilities, Threats, Attacks, and Solutions, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 6, (2023); Yi, Tao, Review on the application of deep learning in network attack detection, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 212, (2023); Shah, Yash, A survey on Classification of Cyber-attacks on IoT and IIoT devices, pp. 0406-0413, (2020); Duo, Wenli, A Survey of Cyber Attacks on Cyber Physical Systems: Recent Advances and Challenges, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 9, 5, pp. 784-800, (2022); Digital Transformation and Challenges to Data Security and Privacy, (2021); Mittal, Meenakshi, Deep learning approaches for detecting DDoS attacks: a systematic review, Soft Computing, 27, 18, pp. 13039-13075, (2023); Sharma, Amit, Advanced Persistent Threats (APT): evolution, anatomy, attribution and countermeasures, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 14, 7, pp. 9355-9381, (2023); Singh, Saurabh, A comprehensive study on APT attacks and countermeasures for future networks and communications: challenges and solutions, Journal of Supercomputing, 75, 8, pp. 4543-4574, (2019); Tahsien, Syeda Manjia, Machine learning based solutions for security of Internet of Things (IoT): A survey, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 161, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201095922"

The increasing support for Matter among numerous vendors in their products is having a noticeable impact on interoperability at the device level. This work expands the reach of Matter to the IoT platform level by integrating it with an open and standardized platform, oneM2M. One of the key strengths of oneM2M is its ability to provide an open, common, and flexible interface at the platform level, facilitating seamless interconnection across various domains. This integration pave the way to provide Matter's smart homes user with advanced intelligence services, including AI/ML applications, and emerging concepts like the metaverse. The proposed Interworking Proxy Entity (IPE) for Matter has been successfully implemented, and multiple scenarios have been tested using both commercial and experimental Matter devices within the oneM2M ACME and Mobius platforms. The results demonstrate seamless integration of Matter devices into the oneM2M platform, enabling other applications to interact with them solely through oneM2M standard interfaces. Additionally, the IPE proves to be practical for real-world applications with negligible overhead, offering mutual benefits for both Matter and oneM2M ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Interworking Proxy Entity; Matter; Onem2m; Onem2m–matter Interoperability","","","","","Gubbi, Jayavardhana, Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions, Future Generation Computer Systems, 29, 7, pp. 1645-1660, (2013); Dahmen, Jessamyn B., Smart secure homes: a survey of smart home technologies that sense, assess, and respond to security threats, Journal of Reliable Intelligent Environments, 3, 2, pp. 83-98, (2017); Sequeiros, Helder, The Impact of IoT Smart Home Services on Psychological Well-Being, Information Systems Frontiers, 24, 3, pp. 1009-1026, (2022); Marikyan, Davit, Smart Home Technology Acceptance: An Empirical Investigation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11701 LNCS, pp. 305-315, (2019); P R Filho, Geraldo, Energy-efficient smart home systems: Infrastructure and decision-making process, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 5, pp. 153-167, (2019); Review of Computer Engineering Studies, (2018); Gøthesen, Sara, Empowering homes with intelligence: An investigation of smart home technology adoption and usage, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 24, (2023); Gomez, Carles, Wireless home automation networks: A survey of architectures and technologies, IEEE Communications Magazine, 48, 6, pp. 92-101, (2010); Zegeye, Wondimu K., Connected Smart Home over Matter Protocol, Digest of Technical Papers - IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics, 2023-January, (2023); Belli, Dimitri, Connectivity Standards Alliance Matter: State of the art and opportunities, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 25, (2024)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","25426605","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200813419"

When aiming to promote solidarity behavior, it is important to be aware of the prosocial perception-behavior gap, and consider different strategies for males and females, including paying more attention to evoking moral emotions in women. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Crisis; Gender; Solidarity Behavior; Solidarity Perception","","","","We would like to thank all respondents who participated in our research project \u201CSolidarity during the Covid-19 outbreak: Evidence from an experimental survey from Vietnam\u201D implemented in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank Institute.

In emerging Asia, where small family businesses play central roles in their economies, previous studies found that the sector was particularly hard hit by the pandemic. However, little is known about how households have mitigated the negative shocks on their family business during the pandemic. Using datasets from representative household surveys in seventeen Asian countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) regions, this study investigates the role of business coping strategies and government financial aid in mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic on family business conditions in the short run. We find that (i) adoption of coping strategy is associated with a lower probability of both a decline in family business income and family business closure; and (ii) government financial aid is associated with a lower probability of a decline in family business income and a higher probability of adopting coping strategies. This study is one of the first to provide empirical evidence on mitigation mechanisms of family business in emerging Asia.

The results find two structural breaks in time: (i) 2002 for state government health spending (SGHS) and (ii) 2014 for central government health spending. The results also show that central revenue transfers to states have a positive and statistically significant effect on SGHS in the long run. The results imply that a 1% rise in central revenue transfers to states leads to a 0.399% increase in SGHS. Further, state government public debt exhibits a negative and statistically significant relationship with SGHS, implying that a 1% rise in public debt leads to a 0.119% fall in SGHS in the long run.

This study aimed to elucidate the droplet detachment mechanism in MCAW using numerical simulations. It was observed that in the initial stage of droplet growth, the argon arc attachment (which carried a large portion of the current) was located on the metal sheath surrounding the unmelted flux. Moreover, an eddy containing an upward flow at the wire axis was formed inside the droplet. When this eddy was formed, the droplet volume increased owing to wire melting. However, neck formation did not occur. This is considered to be because only a small portion of the current is conducted through the droplet, and the Lorentz force acting on the droplet is significantly weak. Thereafter, when the droplet grew to a certain extent and the arc attachment moved below the unmelted flux position, the Lorentz force acted strongly and almost uniformly on the droplet. Accordingly, this eddy disappeared, and the flow abruptly transitioned to a downward unidirectional high-speed flow. Consequently, the droplet began to extend downward to form a neck, which caused it to detach. For these reasons, the time required for droplet detachment increased, and the metal transfer frequency decreased compared with the case of the solid wire. This explains the observation that globular transfer persists in metal-cored wires at currents higher than those for which the transition to spray transfer has occurred for solid wires. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Argon; Gas Metal Arc Welding; Gas Welding; Lorentz Force; Wire; 'current; Arc Attachment; Arc-welding; Argon Gas; Droplet Detachment; Globular Transfer; Metal Cored Wires; Solid Wires; Spray Transfer; Transfer Modes; Drops","Argon; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Lorentz force; Wire; 'current; Arc attachment; Arc-welding; Argon gas; Droplet detachment; Globular transfer; Metal cored wires; Solid wires; Spray transfer; Transfer modes; Drops","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University .; Funding text 2: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

The welding process was carried out at a welding current of 190, 220, 250, 280, and 310 A under an argon–CO<inf>2</inf> shielding gas mixture with six levels of CO<inf>2</inf> concentration of 0, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % for a parametric study. Unlike the conventional solid wire welding trend, where the droplet transfer frequency decreases with the increase in carbon dioxide concentration, an increase in metal transfer frequency was observed with the increase in CO<inf>2</inf> concentration from approximately 5 % to 20 %. The concentration reaching the maximum frequency was 20 % at 190 A, which decreased as the welding current increased, reaching 5 % at 310 A. Droplet initiation at the lower sheath end is succeeded by a gradual downward movement along the flux column's side after a few milliseconds. Upon reaching the lower end, the droplet forms a neck and undergoes separation. Thus, the length of the flux column directly impacts the duration of one droplet transfer cycle. The length was decreased by arc constriction when increasing CO<inf>2</inf> concentration appropriately to concentrate beneath the flux column or by increasing the welding current to raise the arc temperature, which contributed to melting and shortening the flux column. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arc Plasma; Flux Column; Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfer; Metal Vapor; Rutile Flux-cored Wire; Shielding Gas; Argon; Carbon Dioxide; Drops; Gas Metal Arc Welding; Gas Welding; Laser Beam Welding; Oxide Minerals; Shielding; Titanium Alloys; Wire; Arc Plasma; Arc-welding; Co 2 Concentration; Droplet Transfer; Flux Column; Flux-cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfers; Metal Vapor; Rutile Flux Cored Wires; Shielding Gas; Titanium Dioxide","Argon; Carbon dioxide; Drops; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Laser beam welding; Oxide minerals; Shielding; Titanium alloys; Wire; Arc plasma; Arc-welding; CO 2 concentration; Droplet transfer; Flux column; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfers; Metal vapor; Rutile flux cored wires; Shielding gas; Titanium dioxide","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

Although research on Vietnam tourism has grown in number, a macro analysis of national tourism governance and policies has largely been missing. Design/methodology/approach: This synthesis paper offers a systemic analysis of Vietnam’s tourism accommodating intensified government intervention and dramatic market changes in recent decades. The authors offer a chronological analysis of tourism development along with the major political and economic turns of the country. Findings: The patterns of tourism development reflect a compromise between centralization and decentralization of the governance system and a trade-off between economic and social objectives of development. Balancing these opposites, the internal strength of the domestic market and the resilience of communities and businesses become key assets for growth in circumstances where the socialist market economy continues to inform the current and future development of the industry. Research limitations/implications: Although the case of Vietnam is unique, the adaptive mechanism of the tourism industry highlighted in this paper offers a useful lesson for other developing countries. The research addresses tourism in the political economy in developing countries, which is valuable for researchers, policy analysts as well as practitioners in tourism. Practical implications: The practical contribution of the study is derived from authors’ academic and industrial backgrounds. Findings from the study serve as a useful reference for those who embark on the study of tourism governance and policy-making in developing countries and problems associated with the economic transitional process. Those problems of the disparity between centralization and decentralization of the political system might not be only significant in Vietnam, but also prevail in developing countries. Thus, this study offers a point of departure for future empirical and comparative research on the kindship of tourism and political economy in a full scale. Social implications: The transitional economy as viewed through the tourism industry is prominently presented in the “evolutionary” approach to the transitional economy, which exhibits several unique features: the transition from a centrally planned (command) economy to a market economy and the manifestations of a socialist orientation in the modern economic management system (Vuong et al., 2019). While data from this study is mainly illustrative of the first point, the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, the second characteristic, the manifestation of a social orientation has only slightly been addressed and will need further elaboration in a future study. While Vietnam’s tourism positions itself in a socialist market-oriented economy might set a unique case, the study highlights the politics of tourism is shaped by the politico-economic system. The authors conclude that the adaptation of Vietnam tourism to a socialist market-orientated economy is better perceived as a social evolution achievement rather than a feature of capitalism. Originality/value: The latest study on tourism governance (Bui et al., 2022) has outlined the evolution of the tourism administrative system and markets in the country; however, linkages of tourism to the broader political economic system have yet to be addressed. Addressing this gap, the authors carry out analysis of policies and governance from the insider’s viewpoint, when team members have been involved in numerous tourism planning and development projects, both on international and national scales. The practical experience along with thorough review of literature and statistical data contributes to shaping a fresh understanding of tourism in a transitional economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Centralization; Decentralization; Governance; Planning; Socialist Market Economy","","","","The project is funded through Japan Society for Promotion of Sciences, grant number 22H03859.","Journal of Vietnamese Studies, (2018); Tourism in Southeast Asia Challenges and New Direction, (2009); Britton, Stephen G., Tourism, capital, and place: towards a critical geography of tourism, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 9, 4, pp. 451-478, (1991); Britton, Stephen G., The political economy of tourism in the third world, Annals of Tourism Research, 9, 3, pp. 331-358, (1982); Austrian Journal of South East Asian Studies, (2011); Global Climate Change and Coastal Tourism, (2017); Tourism and Development in Southeast Asia, (2020); Bui, Huong T., The History and Evolution of Vietnam Tourism, pp. 12-27, (2022); Bui, Huong T., The adaptive resilience of living cultural heritage in a tourism destination, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 28, 7, pp. 1022-1040, (2020); Bui, Huong T., Tourism Policies and Governance, pp. 28-44, (2022)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","16605373; 17598451","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191759457"

These programs involve the students as internal customers and the business partners as external customers. However, previous studies have yet to examine the management of the relationships with these customers and the logistics of the internship programs. Without this understanding, the internship management and preparation processes may be difficult or inadequate. Therefore, this chapter reports a study investigating the challenges in relationship management in internships and the methods adopted to negotiate with these challenges. The study employed the information provided by two faculty members at a public university in Vietnam via a collaborative autoethnography. This information was also aligned with the existing literature as a validation tactic. The findings revealed a management process of 20 steps and four phases. Each step's challenges (e.g., late responses, sudden cancellation, and agreement violations) and negotiation methods (e.g., backup plans, crisis management, activeness, and flexibility) were detailed. The fundamental logistics functions, including information handling, inventory, packaging, and transportation, were linked to the phases. The chapter then discussed these findings to build up a theory about educational internship logistics and provide some implications for better managing the internship programs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative Autoethnography; Education Logistics; Internship; Relationship Management; Vietnam","","","","","Acosta, Sandra T., Autoethnography in action research for health education practitioners, Action Research, 13, 4, pp. 411-431, (2015); Handbook of Autoethnography, (2013); Aktas, Emel, Outsourcing logistics activities in Turkey, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 18, 3, pp. 316-329, (2005); Alebaikan, Reem, Online and face-to-face guest lectures: graduate students' perceptions, Learning and Teaching in Higher Education: Gulf Perspectives, 13, 2, pp. 53-65, (2016); Alexakis, George, Industry Competencies and the Optimal Hospitality Management Curriculum: An Empirical Study, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Education, 31, 4, pp. 210-220, (2019); Anayah, Bernadette, The Growth of International Student Enrollment at Community Colleges and Implications, Community College Journal of Research and Practice, 39, 12, pp. 1099-1110, (2015); Bhaskar, A.

Using a unique bi-annually household-level dataset from 2012–2016 from Vietnam, we obtain key findings as follows. To mitigate possible endogeneity concerns, we utilize a two-stage least squares regression (2SLS) approach, employing the development of information and communication (ICT) infrastructure at the province level as an instrumental variable (IV). The key findings can be summarized as follows. First, urbanization significantly reduces Vietnamese households’ inpatient and outpatient health expenses. Second, the self-treatment expenses of households increase as the process of urbanization advances. In addition, we perform various robustness checks, encompassing different measures of urbanization, the use of lag of urbanization as an additional IV, and the plausible exogenous IV. The outcomes derived from these rigorous sensitivity analyses substantiate the reliability and consistency of our key results. Finally, we propose different ways to explain these results, including health insurance expenses and household income. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Health Expenditure; Health Insurance; Ict; Instrumental Variable; Urbanization; Vhlss","","","","We acknowledge the financial support that we received from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up (Grant No.23K18795).","Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled, The effects of health insurance on health-seeking behaviour: Evidence from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Risk Management and Healthcare Policy, 13, pp. 595-607, (2020); Anderson, Michael L., The effect of health insurance coverage on the use of medical services, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 4, 1, pp. 1-27, (2012); Attard, Samantha M., Multilevel examination of diabetes in modernising China: What elements of urbanisation are most associated with diabetes?, Diabetologia, 55, 12, pp. 3182-3192, (2012); Chen, Guo, Urbanization and income inequality in post-reform China: A causal analysis based on time series data, PLOS ONE, 11, 7, (2016); Clarke, Damian, Practical considerations for questionable IVs, Stata Journal, 18, 3, pp. 663-691, (2018); Conley, Timothy G., Plausibly exogenous, Review of Economics and Statistics, 94, 1, pp. 260-272, (2012); Dumlupinar Universitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, (2019); Danaei, Goodarz, The global cardiovascular risk transition: Associations of four metabolic risk factors with national income, urbanization, and western diet in 1980 and 2008, Circulation, 127, 14, pp. 1493-1502, (2013); Dang, Thang, Do the more educated utilize more health care services?

We hypothesize that the reduction in women's and men's self-employment would delay family formation and childbirth, with the ultimate impact on marriage remaining ambiguous. Analyzing data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys, we find that both men and women are less likely to be self-employed in the face of a substantial trade shock. Notably, the decreasing impact on women's self-employment becomes more pronounced than that for men post-2012, a decade after the agreement's enforcement. Employing the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and survival analysis, we empirically demonstrate that increased exposure to trade postpones women's timing of marriage and first childbirth. On average, in 2013, the BTA resulted in a 7.39- and 7.42 %-point decrease in the probability of entering marriage and becoming a mother, respectively. We also present suggestive evidence that increased exposure to trade liberalization eventually increases the likelihood of marriage and the number of children among women over 40. The findings in this study imply that policy promoting trade liberalization should consider its extensive impacts on young labor force's family formation through change in their individual economic prospects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Delayed Fertility; Marriage And Fertility In Vietnam; Marriage Timing; Reproductive Decision-making; Trade Liberalization","","","","This work was supported by the Policy Research Center at National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies [Project Number: P231RP201 .","Amiti, Mary, Trade liberalization, intermediate inputs, and productivity: Evidence from Indonesia, American Economic Review, 97, 5, pp. 1611-1638, (2007); Ngo, Anh P., Effects of Vietnam’s two-child policy on fertility, son preference, and female labor supply, Journal of Population Economics, 33, 3, pp. 751-794, (2020); American Economic Review Insights, (2019); Journal of Political Economy, (1973); A Treatise on the Family, (1981); Black, Sandra E., Importing equality?

Our findings are three-fold. First, provincial income clustering in Vietnam follows patterns of club convergence towards multiple equilibria. Seven convergence clubs encompassing 61 provinces are identified. Second, spatial autocorrelation encourages neighboring provinces to converge toward shared income equilibria. High-income clusters are observed in the Northern and Southern Key Economic Regions, while low-income clusters are concentrated in the mountainous areas of Northern Vietnam. Finally, both internal and external factors significantly affect the formation of convergence clubs. Vital internal factors include localities’ initial conditions of physical capital and structural change. Meanwhile, external factors refer to spatial externalities among neighboring provinces. We highlight spatial complementarity in physical capital accumulation and spatial competition in industrial intensification among neighboring provinces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Club Convergence; Income Clustering; O40; O47; R10; R11; Spatial Dependence; Spatial Externalities; Structural Changes; Vietnam","","","","","Aginta, Harry, Spatial dynamics of consumer price in Indonesia: convergence clubs and conditioning factors, Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science, 5, 2, pp. 427-451, (2021); Anselin, Luc E., Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA, Geographical Analysis, 27, 2, pp. 93-115, (1995); Bartkowska, Monika, Regional convergence clubs in Europe: Identification and conditioning factors, Economic Modelling, 29, 1, pp. 22-31, (2012); Bentzen, Jan, Regional income convergence in an emerging Asian economy: empirical evidence from Vietnam, Post-Communist Economies, 33, 1, pp. 64-78, (2021); Cutrini, Eleonora, Economic integration, structural change, and uneven development in the European Union, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 50, pp. 102-113, (2019); Le, Thi Thu Diem, Fiscal decentralization and income convergence: evidence from Vietnam, Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy, 29, 3, pp. 1513-1532, (2024); Revilla Diez, Javier, Vietnam 30 years after Doi Moi: Achievements and challenges, Zeitschrift fur Wirtschaftsgeographie, 60, 3, pp. 121-133, (2016); Du, Kerui, Econometric convergence test and club clustering using stata, Stata Journal, 17, 4, pp. 882-900, (2017); Spatial Econometrics from Cross Sectional Data to Spatial Panels, (2014); Esiyok, Bulent, A SPATIAL REGRESSION APPROACH to FDI in Vietnam: PROVINCE-LEVEL EVIDENCE, Singapore Economic Review, 62, 2, pp. 459-481, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","25097954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189915492"

The study found that CPEL reduces the dropout rate of children by 12%. However, the effect is minor, especially when compared with the impact of family income and parents' education. This finding is similar to those of other studies, suggesting that in addition to CPEL, other family income support and parent-oriented policies are crucial to improving children's educational attainment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Children's Educational Attainment; Compulsory Education; Dropout Rate; Survival Analysis; Academic Performance; Child Development; Educational Attainment; Income Distribution; Primary Education; Social Policy; Socioeconomic Conditions; Viet Nam","academic performance; child development; educational attainment; income distribution; primary education; social policy; socioeconomic conditions; Viet Nam","","","This research is funded by Thuongmai University, Hanoi, Vietnam.","Abdullah, Abdul Jabbar, Does education reduce income inequality?

Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ threshold co-integration tests and a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model to study the asymmetric dynamics of ASEAN equity markets. The study’s data cover the 2009–2022 period for seven member states: Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Findings: The authors find evidence supporting co-integration relationships; adjustment toward equilibrium is asymmetric in the short run and symmetric in the long run for these countries. While co-movement in ASEAN equity markets seems encouraging for initiatives seeking to foster financial integration in regional economies, the benefits for international portfolio diversification appear to be neutralized. Originality/value: The issue of stock market integration is important among policymakers, investors and academics. This study examines the level of stock market integration in ASEAN during the 2009–2022 period. For this purpose, advanced co-integration techniques are applied to different frequencies of data (daily, weekly and monthly) for comparison and completeness. The empirical analysis of this study is conducted using the Enders and Siklos (2001) co-integration and threshold adjustment procedure. This advanced co-integration technique is superior compared to other co-integration techniques by permitting asymmetry in the adjustment toward equilibrium. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asean; Nonlinear Ardl Model; Stock Market Integration; Threshold Co-integration","","","","","Aït-Sahalia, Yacine, The leverage effect puzzle: Disentangling sources of bias at high frequency, Journal of Financial Economics, 109, 1, pp. 224-249, (2013); Batten, Jonathan A., Time-varying energy and stock market integration in Asia, Energy Economics, 80, pp. 777-792, (2019); Bekaert, Geert, Time‐Varying World Market Integration, Journal of Finance, 50, 2, pp. 403-444, (1995); Bekaert, Geert, International stock return comovements, Journal of Finance, 64, 6, pp. 2591-2626, (2009); Proceedings of the American Statistical Association Business and Economic Statistics Section, (1976); Caporale, Guglielmo Maria, Global and regional stock market integration in Asia: A panel convergence approach, International Review of Financial Analysis, 65, (2019); Caporale, Guglielmo Maria, Stock Market Linkages between the Asean Countries, China and the US: A Fractional Integration/cointegration Approach, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 58, 5, pp. 1502-1514, (2022); Chen, Li Hsueh, A threshold cointegration analysis of asymmetric price transmission from crude oil to gasoline prices, Economics Letters, 89, 2, pp. 233-239, (2005); Chien, Meise, Dynamic Asian stock market convergence: Evidence from dynamic cointegration analysis among China and ASEAN-5, Economic Modelling, 51, pp. 84-98, (2015); Click, Reid W., Stock market integration in ASEAN after the Asian financial crisis, Journal of Asian Economics, 16, 1, pp. 5-28, (2005)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","2515964X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140991630"

The research and its outcomes presented here focus especially on diverse cases from emerging countries in East Asia, where local companies face similar technological change. The pandemic has seriously changed people’s lives and affected the development of society as a whole, while digital technologies have become even more greatly in demand. Those are very difficult to fit into traditional management models created decades ago, however. For the successful implementation of such a transition, new paradigms, models, and technologies for the transformation of control systems are needed. To meet that need, a new paradigm to bring about innovation under the new knowledge transformation system is required. This book presents the experiences of beginning such a knowledge transformation inEast Asian countries. Despite the fact that the countries are in the same geographical region, their experiences are quite diverse, determined by cultural, historical, religious, and psychological factors. These differences appear not only in such important areas as R&D processes, but also in production, finance, HR management, and marketing. Readers will find innovative solutions for the transformation of management in the new knowledge transformation system that is the focus of this book. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Eco-systems; Digital Hybrid Value Chain; Inclusive Business Innovation; It-bpo; It-business Process Outsourcing; It-led Business Management; New Industrial Development Path","","","","","","","Springer Nature","","","","","","","9789819973002; 9789819973019","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205607096"

Organic waste has been recognized as a valuable resource; however, organic waste treatment remains a global challenge in the 21st century. State-of-the-art treatment technologies designed for organic waste to combat resource depletion and mitigate global warming are vital. Organic waste streams generated by industries, agriculture, and municipal solid waste including human waste are the major sources of waste that pose environmental issues. The application of green technology for organic waste treatment is a sustainable approach to mitigating climate change and conserving our depleting resources. Emerging green technologies such as fermentation, anaerobic digestion, vermicomposting, and bioremediation are widely utilized in transforming organic waste into sustainable resources. Such valuable resources include bioplastics, biofuels, and biofertilizers. A sustainable approach in organic waste management by integrating green technology is a close-loop method, which supports a circular economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abbassi-Guendouz, Amel, Total solids content drives high solid anaerobic digestion via mass transfer limitation, Bioresource Technology, 111, pp. 55-61, (2012); Acosta-Cárdenas, Alejandro, Sugarcane molasses and vinasse as a substrate for polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production, DYNA (Colombia), 85, 206, pp. 220-225, (2018); Adnan, Amir Izzuddin, Technologies for biogas upgrading to biomethane: A review, Bioengineering, 6, 4, (2019); Int J Food Sci Agric, (2021); Ahmadi-Moghadam, Mehdi, Data on biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons using co-composting of cow manure/oily drill wastes, Data in Brief, 9, pp. 723-726, (2016); Ahmed, Shams Forruque, Recent developments in physical, biological, chemical, and hybrid treatment techniques for removing emerging contaminants from wastewater, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 416, (2021); Alewell, C., Global phosphorus shortage will be aggravated by soil erosion, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); M Alshehrei, Fatimah, Vermicomposting: A management tool to mitigate solid waste, Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences, 28, 6, pp. 3284-3293, (2021); Alvarez, Jose M., Morpho-physiological plant quality when biochar and vermicompost are used as growing media replacement in urban horticulture, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, 34, pp. 175-180, (2018); Ameen, Fuad, Improving the efficiency of vermicomposting of polluted organic food wastes by adding biochar and mangrove fungi, Chemosphere, 286, (2022)","","CRC Press","","","","","","","9781040004302; 9781032439075","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194019638"

The packet loss in the network, due to link corruption and congestion, causes the performance degradation of many network services, affecting the application experience. Packet loss often happens in both lossy networks like wireless networks and reliable local networks like data center networks. The previous papers proposed methods to estimate the link loss (packet loss on link) and feedback to the controller via the OpenFlow. However, the feedback process passively depends on the scheduled OpenFlow Flow-Stat packet sent from the controller, resulting in late detection and response to the loss events. Besides, the accumulated loss in a path with multiple nodes causes a less accurate estimation at the node far from the measurement host due to insufficient probe packets. Therefore, this paper proposes a new scheme based on programmable data plane-enabled switches, such as the P4-enabled switch, to actively calculate the link loss and send the feedback to the controller. It also ensures the total probe packet at all links always equals the one that departs from the measurement host by supplementing the probe packet to compensate for the loss in the previous link. The simulation on ns-3 shows the efficiency of the proposed scheme in achieving a good accuracy estimation and a short response time to the network state change. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","In-band Network Detection; Link Loss Rate Monitoring; Ns-3; P4; Programmable Data Plane; Sdn; Controllers; Feedback; Probes; Data Planes; Data-plane; In-band; In-band Network Detection; Link Loss; Link Loss Rate Monitoring; Loss Rates; Network Detections; Ns-3; Programmable Data Plane; Rate Monitoring; Sdn; Packet Loss","Controllers; Feedback; Probes; Data planes; Data-plane; In-band; In-band network detection; Link loss; Link loss rate monitoring; Loss rates; Network detections; Ns-3; Programmable data plane; Rate monitoring; SDN; Packet loss","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2023-18-01 for Nguyen Viet Ha and JSPS KAKENHI 20K11770, NICT commissioned research JPJ012368C05501, Japan for Masato Tsuru.","Ha, Nguyen Viet, TCP with Network Coding Enhanced in Bi-Directional Loss Tolerance, IEEE Communications Letters, 24, 3, pp. 520-524, (2020); 5g Fixed Wireless Vs Leo Vs Cable Home Internet Performance Comparison, (2023); Zhuo, Danyang, Understanding and mitigating packet corruption in data center networks, pp. 362-375, (2017); A Simple Network Management Protocol Snmp, (1990); Tri, Nguyen Minh, Effective route scheme of multicast probing to locate high-loss links in openflow networks, Journal of Information Processing, 29, pp. 115-123, (2021); Programming Protocol Independent Packet Processors P4, (2023); Network Simulator 3, (2023); Tri, Nguyen Minh, Locating Deteriorated Links by Network-Assisted Multicast Proving on OpenFlow Networks, Proceedings - International Symposium on Computers and Communications, 2019-June, (2019); Joshi, Raj, Masking Corruption Packet Losses in Datacenter Networks with Link-local Retransmission, pp. 288-304, (2023); Implementing Your Switch Target with Bmv2, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","16th International Conference on Knowledge and Smart Technology, KST 2024","","Krabi; Deevana Plaza Krabi Aonang","198941","","9798350370737","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191655915"

Notably, customer market knowledge and supplier market knowledge play the primary source in the FE process in Western and Eastern countries. Empirical evidence suggests that manufacturing managers should consider customer and supplier market knowledge to enhance NPD success, quality, and customer satisfaction.

Previous studies have intensively investigated factors influencing opportunism but overfocusing on the organisational level. Recently, supply chain researchers have called for identifying factors influencing opportunism at the individual level to gain a more comprehensive understanding of opportunism. Based on transaction cost theory, resource dependence theory, and boundary spanning theory, this study seeks to advance the emerging research stream on opportunism at the individual level by investigating how buyer agents’ boundary spanning capabilities and firms’ long–term relationship orientation can help manage supplier agents’ opportunism. Using a cross–sectional data set of 406 buyer agents from manufacturing companies collected from February to April 2021 in Japan, we tested a set of hypotheses through regression and conditional process analyses. Our findings suggest that buyer agents’ strategic communication and firms’ long–term relationship orientation are critical factors that reduce supplier agents’ opportunism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boundary Spanning Capability; Inter–firm Relationship; Japan; Long–term Orientation; Opportunism","","","","","Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, (1976); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Akrout, Houcine, Fundamental transformations of trust and its drivers: A multi-stage approach of business-to-business relationships, Industrial Marketing Management, 66, pp. 159-171, (2017); Academy of Management Review, (1977); Aoki, Katsuki, The role of ambidexterity in managing buyer-supplier relationships: The Toyota case, Organization Science, 28, 6, pp. 1080-1097, (2017); Au, Kevin Yuk Fai, Boundary spanning behaviors of expatriates, Journal of World Business, 37, 4, pp. 285-296, (2002); Bals, Lydia, Purchasing and supply management (PSM) competencies: Current and future requirements, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, 5, (2019); Supply Chain Forum an International Journal, (2011); Bhattacharya, Ananya, Antecedents of buyer opportunistic behavior in outsourcing relationships, International Journal of Production Economics, 166, pp. 258-268, (2015); Cai, Shaohan Alan, On boundary spanners and interfirm embeddedness: The role of guanxi institution in China, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 27, 1, (2021)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","16246039; 16258312","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180230509"

Moreover, the IC evaluation is, in fact, a multicriteria process with high uncertainty, since the market environments and competitors' performance are both in a dynamic environment. Therefore, the evaluation of IC under uncertainty is vital to organizations. This study proposes a new integrated method for the evaluation of IC in banking organizations by combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the evidential reasoning (ER) approach in terms of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Three Vietnamese banks were used as a case study to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed method. Experts in banking-related fields were invited to determine the relative importance weights of critical innovation management practices (CIMPs) and their sub-CIMPs using the AHP and to score the maturity levels of sub-CIMPs at the evaluated banks. The ER approach was then applied to generate aggregated assessments representing the ICs of banks that were finally used for their ranking in terms of IC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (ahp); Banking; Evaluation; Evidential Reasoning (er); Innovation Capability (ic); Uncertainty; Formal Logic; Hierarchical Systems; Integrated Circuits; Timing Circuits; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Evaluation; Evidential Reasoning; Innovation Capability; Innovation Management; Technological Innovation; Uncertainty","Formal logic; Hierarchical systems; Integrated circuits; Timing circuits; Analytic hierarchy process; Evaluation; Evidential reasoning; Innovation capability; Innovation management; Technological innovation; Uncertainty","","","This work was supported in part by the Centre of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University, Thailand.","Günday, Gürhan, Effects of innovation types on firm performance, International Journal of Production Economics, 133, 2, pp. 662-676, (2011); Journal of Modern Accounting and Auditing, (2013); Frishammar, Johan, Antecedents and consequences of firms process innovation capability: A literature review and a conceptual framework, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 59, 4, pp. 519-529, (2012); Dozier, Priya D., Banking on Blockchain: An Evaluation of Innovation Decision Making, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 67, 4, pp. 1129-1141, (2020); Wang, Xiaoli, Innovation Efficiency Evaluation Based on a Two-Stage DEA Model With Shared-Input: A Case of Patent-Intensive Industry in China, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 70, 5, pp. 1808-1822, (2023); Koliouska, Christiana H., Multicriteria Evaluation of the Websites of Alternative Tourism Enterprises: Case Study in the Region of Crete, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 70, 6, pp. 2233-2240, (2023); Kong, Yusheng, Service innovation, service delivery and customer satisfaction and loyalty in the banking sector of Ghana, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 37, 5, pp. 1215-1233, (2019); Beccalli, Elena, Does IT investment improve bank performance?

This study describes the types of livelihood adaptations (LAs) that coastal fishers in QN have practiced in response to EWEs and find the varieties in these adaptation strategy choices. In this study, we investigated livelihood adaptation strategies in coastal areas through a household survey and analysis of the collected data using MS Excel. Two sample strategies were used, stratified and random sampling, to select 229 coastal fishers from 11 communes; and data are collected through designed questionnaires. The current study employed statistical disaggregation and comparative methods to analyze coastal fishers’ adaptation strategy choices in QN Province. A range of adaptation strategies were identified consisting of five reactive LAs and eight anticipatory LAs practiced differently by coastal fishers. Among the eight anticipatory LAs, discontinuing production for a certain time is a novel adaptation in QN Province. In addition, a divergence in conducting LAs by production forms was found. On-sand farming and offshore fishers invest in advanced technologies and facilities as adaptive measures. By contrast, fishers who farm in estuaries, lagoons, and nearshore fishing fishers are more likely to change and diversify their jobs. The study’s key findings about livelihood adaptation measures and their differences are significant for improving coastal fisher’s livelihoods in Vietnam. Any efforts at local and national levels in developing mitigation strategies for the impact of EWEs may consider the coastal fisher’s adaptation choices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through the Project for Human Resources Development Scholarship by the Japanese Grant Aid (JDS).

Unlike many smart technologies, emotion-recognition systems sense, monitor, harvest and analyze data extracted from a person’s non-conscious or psycho-physical state, often without their knowledge or consent. As a far more invasive manner of surveillance capitalism, the technological adoption of emotional AI is problematized by a myriad of legal, ethical, cultural, and scientific issues. To better understand the behavioral factors determining an individual’s attitude towards this emerging technology, we first identify five major tensions that may impinge on adoption. Second, we extend the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) model with insights from the mindsponge model of information filtering (Vuong and Napier, 2015) along with quantitative affordances offered by the Bayesian computational approach. Our analysis was conducted based on a multi-national dataset surveying perceptions of 1015 young adults (age 18–27) regarding emotional AI applications and their socio-cultural characteristics such as income, region, religiosity, and home country politics. These characteristics are fed into our Bayesian multi-level models as varying intercepts so that we can systematically measure and compare the effects of various behavioral determinants on the attitudes of respondents towards non-conscious data harvesting by government and private sector actors. Critically, this study finds respondents who feel more familiar with, and perceive more utilities in AI technologies, as well as rate themselves as more restrained from heated arguments on social media, feel less threatened by the practice of non-conscious data harvesting by both government and private sector actors. Our findings offer a fertile platform for further exploration of the intersection between psychology, culture, and emotion-recognition technologies as well as important insights for policymakers wishing to ensure design and regulation of the technology serve the best interests of society. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study is part of the project \u201CEmotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life \u201D funded by JST-UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019) (https://www.jst.go.jp/ristex/hite/en/topics/409.html), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6.

The research addresses key questions regarding the speed of Asian states’ involvement in multilateral treaties and their adaptation to these treaties within the United Nations system over time. The approach combines empirical data and conceptualization to ensure a robust evidentiary basis. A dataset comprising 600 major multilateral treaties deposited in the United Nations system, covering diverse global issues, was collected. Additionally, ratification actions from twenty-eight Asian countries were categorized into four sub-regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia. To quantitatively measure states’ engagement with multilateral treaties, the study developed and calculated the Treaty Participation Index for each Asian country and sub-group. In an area predominantly characterized by qualitative research, this paper contributes to the existing literature by providing quantitative and metric findings for comparative analyses of multilateral treaty participation among the four Asian sub-regions, as well as comparisons between Asia and the rest of the world. By analyzing the results, the paper offers an evidence-based assessment of the feasibility of these four regionalisms in Asia, particularly in the context of the transition from international politics to the paradigm of global politics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 506.01-2019.301.","Conventions Treaties and Other Responses to Global Issues in Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems Eolss Developed Under the Auspices of the Unesco, (2004); Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira, Minority game with local interactions due to the presence of herding behavior, Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics, 355, 4-5, pp. 280-284, (2006); Denemark, Robert A., Just scraps of paper?: The dynamics of multilateral treaty-making, Cooperation and Conflict, 43, 2, pp. 185-219, (2008); Frederick, Shane W., Time discounting and time preference: A critical review, Journal of Economic Literature, 40, 2, pp. 351-401, (2002); Glas, Aarie, Understanding Multilateral Treaty-Making as Constitutive Practice, Journal of Global Security Studies, 3, 3, pp. 339-357, (2018); Opendemocracy, (2017); Jia Sipa, (2020); Foreign Affairs, (2002); Development of Global Legislative Politics Rousseau and Locke Writ Global, (2019); undefined, (2023)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164140668"

We construct a financial literacy index using a representative sample of 25,000 individuals from the Bank of Japan’s 2019 Financial Literacy Survey. We then analyze the relationship between this index and the extensive and intensive usage of two types of payment services: electronic money (e-money) and mobile payment apps. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that higher financial literacy is positively associated with a higher likelihood of adopting ePayment services. The empirical results suggest that individuals with higher financial literacy use payment services more frequently. We also find that risk-averse people are less likely to adopt and use ePayment services, whereas people with herd behavior tend to adopt and use ePayment services more.

However, the complexity level of tasks is unstructured, dynamic and complicated to perform. This paper develops a new method for evaluating the complexity level of tasks in the production process to support production managers to control their manufacturing systems in terms of flexibility, reliability to production planning and labor cost. Design/methodology/approach: The complexity level of tasks will be analyzed based on the structuralist concept. Using the structure of task, the factors that significantly affect the task complexity in an assembly line will be defined, and the complexity level of the task will be evaluated by measuring the number of task components. Using the proportional 2-tuples linguistic values, the difference between the complexity levels of tasks can be compared and described clearly. Findings: Based on the structure of the task, three contributory factors including input factors, process-operation factors and output factors that significantly affect the task complexity in an assembly line are identified in the present study. The complexity level of the task is quantified through analyzing the details of the three factors according to two criteria and six sub-criteria within the textile case study. Originality/value: The proposed approach provides a new insight about the factors that have an effect on the complexity of tasks in production and remedies some of limitations of previous methods. The combination of experts' experience and scientific knowledge will improve the accuracy in determining the complexity level of tasks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahp Method; Linguistic Variables; Proportional 2-tuple Linguistic Representation Model; Task Complexity","","","","The authors would like to thank Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for the support of time and facilities for this study.","Afsar, Bilal, Transformational leadership and innovative work behavior: The role of motivation to learn, task complexity and innovation climate, European Journal of Innovation Management, 23, 3, pp. 402-428, (2020); Digital Transformation in Smart Manufacturing, (2018); Alkan, Bugra, Complexity in manufacturing systems and its measures: A literature review, European Journal of Industrial Engineering, 12, 1, pp. 116-150, (2018); Bag, Surajit, Modeling barriers of digital manufacturing in a circular economy for enhancing sustainability, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 71, 3, pp. 833-869, (2022); Bedny, Gregory Z., Complexity Evaluation of Computer-Based Tasks, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 28, 4, pp. 236-257, (2012); Bommer, Sharon Claxton, A theoretical framework for evaluating mental workload resources in human systems design for manufacturing operations, International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 63, pp. 7-17, (2018); Braarud, Per Øivind, Task complexity: What challenges the crew and how do they cope, pp. 233-251, (2011); Brown, Thomas M., Communication networks in task-performing groups: Effects of task complexity, time pressure, and interpersonal dominance, Small Group Research, 31, 2, pp. 131-157, (2000); Calinescu, Ani, Applying and assessing two methods for measuring complexity in manufacturing, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 49, 7, pp. 723-733, (1998); Chakraborty, Kaustov, Key decision-making areas of automotive engine remanufacturing: A case study, International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management, 39, 3, pp. 333-358, (2021)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17410401","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138273562"

The results showed that 16 of 90 Pangasius fish (18%) and 6 of 54 fish processing handlers’ samples (11%) harbored coagulase-positive for S. aureus. A high antibiotic resistance (68%) was observed for ampicillin, while 100% susceptibility for oxacillin, cefazolin, cefmetazole, flomoxef, imipenem, arbekacin, fosfomycin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were recorded for both fish and hand samples. Remarkably, only one isolates from the fish was classified as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, whereas no isolates from the handlers were found. Among the total S. aureus isolates, the multidrug resistance rate was nearly 41%, posing a hazard to public health concerns.

Utilising firm-level data from the Vietnam Technology and Competitiveness Survey and Vietnam Enterprise Survey from 2009 to 2018, we employ panel fixed-effect regression to analyse the dynamics. The findings show that Vietnam’s GVC participation has been driven mainly by backward rather than forward linkages, signifying a reliance on foreign inputs for exports. The study found a positive impact of backward and forward GVC participation on labour productivity. However, the results show a stark contrast when considering the degree of GVC participation (i.e. GVC participation index). While forward GVC participation positively impacts labour productivity, backward GVC participation demonstrates a negative effect. The results partly reject the learning-to-learn hypothesis while supporting the notion that productivity improvements in Vietnam are associated with learning-by-exporting and learning-by-supplying. We suggest that the prioritisation of forward GVC participation should be accompanied by well-designed backward participation strategies to promote labour productivity. The study concludes with a few policy implications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global Value Chain Participation; Labour Productivity; Learning-by-exporting; Learning-to-learn; Vietnam","","","","The authors sincerely thank the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) for its financial support.

This paper aims to elucidate the PFES implementation in Thua Thien Hue Province, and to assess the influence of the PFES on the livelihood of forest protectors, especially ethnic minorities. We interviewed 133 out of 397 households in two villages in Hong Kim commune, divided into two different groups: Forest protection groups (FPG) and Non-forest protection groups (NFPG). Our study indicated that the success in negotiating and expanding the number of service users has increased the forest area covered by the PFES for seven years. Nonetheless, revenue from PFES still fluctuates from year to year due to their great dependence on a limited number of service users. PFES payment (only 2%) did not contribute significantly to the total income of forest protector households. Interestingly, both monetary and non-monetary values seem to encourage local people to join the forest protection group. To better implement PFES, it is necessary to identify and expand service beneficiaries. Remote sensing technology improved PFES in TTH by aiding forest patrols, but there is a lack of maintaining forest quality during degradation, needing commitments to restore degraded forests and raise patrol accountability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethnic Minorities; Mountainous Livelihood; Pfes; Thua Thien Hue; Vietnam; Ecosystem Service; Ethnic Minority; Forest Resource; Livelihood; Remote Sensing; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam","ecosystem service; ethnic minority; forest resource; livelihood; remote sensing; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by the Special Program of Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) , Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) .","undefined, (2019); Forests and Gender Iucn Wedo, (2011); Payment for Environmental Services in Agricultural Landscapes, (2009); undefined, (2021); Clements, Tom J., Impact of payments for environmental services and protected areas on local livelihoods and forest conservation in northern Cambodia, Conservation Biology, 29, 1, pp. 78-87, (2015); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2015); undefined, (2019); undefined, (2010); undefined, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26667193","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164206595"

This research examines the factors affecting the internet use of agricultural cooperatives with a focus on female leadership, its effects on cooperatives’ economic, social, and innovative performance, and the distributional effects of internet use on economic performance. Our analysis relied on the data of 3,512 agricultural cooperatives collected in 2021 from Vietnam. We addressed the endogeneity issue of internet use in impact assessment by employing an instrumental variable approach. Our results show that female leadership was positively and significantly associated with internet use and that internet use had a positive and significant effect on returns on assets, returns on equity, labor productivity, payment per laborer, contribution to labor union and insurance per laborer, and innovation in products of agricultural cooperatives. In addition, unconditional quantile regressions show that internet use in agricultural cooperatives exacerbated income inequality.

To achieve the goal of popularizing OF, besides encouraging the participation of newcomers, the government should also focus on farmers already involved because their production decisions are the most effective means for communication. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated smallholder farmer intentions to scale up organic rice farming (ORF). Data were obtained through direct interviews with 325 farmers in the Phu Vang, Phong Dien and Huong Thuy Districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The results revealed the ineffectiveness in demographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, number of laborers, OF experience, percentage of organic rice area, non-farm jobs and involvement in community-based organizations to predict farmer intentions to expand ORF. The findings highlighted the more significant influence of factors related to economic outcomes, farmer awareness of OF, and their confidence in the market outlook.

This paper designs a new fusion method of improved decision-directed acyclic graph (IDDAG) based on the principle of maximizing generalization ability and integrates it with the one-versus-one (OVO) decomposition method (OVO-IDDAG) to build MFDP models. Based on data of Chinese listed companies, we categorize corporate financial status into four states (financial soundness, financial pseudosoundness, moderate financial distress, and serious financial distress) and compare the MFDP performance of OVO-IDDAG with two benchmark methods, that is, the OVO decomposition method integrated with the max-win fusion method (OVO- max-win) and the OVO decomposition method integrated with the original DDAG fusion method (OVO-ODDAG). The experimental results show that the OVO-IDDAG method overall outperformances the benchmark methods. Among the six base classifiers of multivariate discriminant analysis, Logit, naive bayes, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest and the three imbalance processing mechanisms of random oversampling, random undersampling, and synthetic minority oversampling technique, the combination of the random forest classifier with the imbalance processing mechanism of random undersampling or the support vector machine classifier with the imbalance processing mechanism of random oversampling or synthetic minority oversampling technique is more suitable for MFDP based on OVO-IDDAG.

The estimated demand elasticities are then compared and analyzed over time. Findings: The empirical results show that in the last decade, meat consumption patterns in Vietnam have undergone a remarkable structural change, with poultry and beef increasingly taking important roles in the meat consumption structure of households. In addition, demographic characteristics, including settlement type, household size and the age of the household head, have significantly influenced meat expenditure patterns in Vietnam. Research limitations/implications: The paper considers the demand for meat consumed at home but not meat consumed away from home. Originality/value: In many developing countries, increased disposable income, together with rapid urbanization and international integration, has significantly changed consumers' food consumption behaviors.

As one of the most attractive machine learning algorithms, random forest is widely used in many fields. However, the random forest algorithm is computational and resource intensive, especially for large datasets. Therefore, it is not widely used for IoT applications. This paper proposes a flexible and efficient FPGA-based architecture for random forest targeting edge computing platforms where resources and computing power are limited. The architecture allows the number of decision trees in the random forest to be reconfigured for a particular platform. To improve the system's performance based on this architecture, we design a pipeline decision tree processor to compute decision trees that are the main components of the random forest algorithm.

Furthermore, our system in the two edge computing platforms is energy-efficiency also when it consumes 3.721 μJPS (μ-joule per sample) and 3.328 μJPS for the PYNQ-Z2 and Kria KV260 platforms, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fpga-based Architecture; Iots Edge Computing; Random Forest","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number NCM2021-20-02 .

Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the development of leadership research in construction by showing the significance of leadership at the supply chain level. Originality/value: Leadership is regarded as a key factor for most organizations' success and competitive advantages. In construction, leadership has been widely studied at the project and organizational levels while its important role is also explored at the supply chain level. Nevertheless, in terms of construction supply chains, there has been still very limited evidence about the effects of transformational leadership. Thus, this study fills the gap in knowledge by empirically examining the relationships between transformational leadership, green learning and green innovation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction; Green Innovation; Green Learning; Supply Chains; Transformational Leadership; Competition; Construction Industry; Surveys; Construction Supply Chain; Design/methodology/approach; Green Innovations; Green Learning; Green Process; Innovation In Construction; Process Innovation; Questionnaire Data; Theoretical Framework; Transformational Leadership; Supply Chains","Competition; Construction industry; Surveys; Construction supply chain; Design/methodology/approach; Green innovations; Green learning; Green process; Innovation in construction; Process Innovation; Questionnaire data; Theoretical framework; Transformational leadership; Supply chains","","","","Albort-Morant, Gema, The antecedents of green innovation performance: A model of learning and capabilities, Journal of Business Research, 69, 11, pp. 4912-4917, (2016); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Argote, Linda M., Organizational Learning and Management of Technology, Production and Operations Management, 26, 4, pp. 579-590, (2017); Barrick, Murray R., Collective organizational engagement: Linking motivational antecedents, strategic implementation, and firm performance, Academy of Management Journal, 58, 1, pp. 111-135, (2015); Bass, Bernard M., From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision, Organizational Dynamics, 18, 3, pp. 19-31, (1990); Transformational Leadership, (2006); Becker, Jan Michael, Accounting for sampling weights in PLS path modeling: Simulations and empirical examples, European Management Journal, 34, 6, pp. 606-617, (2016); Bessant, John R., Developing learning networks, AI and Society, 15, 1-2, pp. 82-98, (2001); Bessant, John R., Putting supply chain learning into practice, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 23, 2, pp. 167-184, (2003); Boehm, Stephan Alexander, The missing link?

To this end, ICN (Information-Centric Networking), which implements the innovative ideas of in-network caching and named content as the communication identifier instead of IP address as in TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, the standard Internet protocol suite), has been among the most promising future Internet (FI) designs to solve most of the conventional IP-based network architecture. However, ICN also consumes higher energy than TCP/IP design as extra power is required for enabling in-network caching capability. Hence, this energy efficiency (EE) issue needs to be addressed so that ICN can be a feasible and practical FI architecture for highly efficient yet sustainable network infrastructure deployment. This chapter then presents and investigates the performance of a novel ""green"" FI prototype, termed as Green ICN, for the realization of a scalable and sustainable real-world network infrastructure toward future networks. Specifically, the Green ICN system efficiently switches network node links and tunes content providers/servers' optimized operating mode to save considerable power while meeting network traffic load with required (high) network performance, especially in the case of low traffic with light underutilization periods. To further diminish the overall network system's power consumption, a popularity-aware caching scheme is implemented by setting higher priorities for serving more ""popular"" content items. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Internet; Future Communication Networks; Green Networking; Information And Communications Technology (ict); Network Design; Sustainable Network Solutions","","","","","Abdali, Taj Aldeen Naser, Fog Computing Advancement: Concept, Architecture, Applications, Advantages, and Open Issues, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 75961-75980, (2021); Alhasani, Mohammed Mustafa, A novel four single-sideband M-QAM modulation scheme using a shadow equalizer for mimo system toward 5G communications, Sensors, 19, 8, (2019); Arifuzzaman, Dr Mohammad, Locating the content in the locality: ICN caching and routing strategy revisited, pp. 423-428, (2015); Barroso, Luiz André, The case for energy-proportional computing, Computer, 40, 12, pp. 33-37, (2007); Bashir, Shahid, An optimized algorithm for D2D-MIMO 5G wireless networks, Computers, Materials and Continua, 68, 3, pp. 3029-3044, (2021); Integrated Icn and Cdn Slice as A Service, (2018); Breslau, Lee, Web caching and zipf-like distributions: Evidence and implications, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 1, pp. 126-134, (1999); An Energy Efficiency Assessment of Content Centric Networking Ccn, (2012); Chiaraviglio, Luca, Minimizing ISP network energy cost: Formulation and solutions, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 20, 2, pp. 463-476, (2012); Dai, Jie, Collaborative hierarchical caching with dynamic request routing for massive content distribution, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 2444-2452, (2012)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783031019494; 9783031019487","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198693138"

The authors consider the impacts that this may have on the livelihoods of rural Vietnamese small farmers. Rice is an “impure public good” that includes both “private” and “public” attributes that consumers consider in their purchase decisions. Consumers make tradeoffs between environmentally and socially beneficial practices (public goods) and perceptions of product quality (private goods). The authors used latent class modeling to investigate the values associated with attributes of rice that is produced using sustainable farming practices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a discrete choice experimental design in which consumers stated their choices among combinations of rice attributes. The survey provided responses from 360 urban Vietnamese consumers and allowed to estimate the preferences and nonpecuniary values for rice grown using different levels of environmentally beneficial production methods. Findings: The results identify two segments of rice consumers: one group of consumers who are sensitive to price and the other group who are sensitive to environmental issues. The individual characteristics are reflected in the choices of production methods and in the willingness to pay for environmentally beneficial outcomes of those methods. Research limitations/implications: Given the number of independent variables measured, the sample was relatively small, such that confirmatory statistical methods were inconclusive. However, the authors used multiple analytical tools that provide corroboration of the significant determinants of the utility functions for the two segments. Practical implications: The results provide directions for production of rice at a national level, as well as practical implications for consumer-oriented communications. Social implications: Results suggest that the emerging middle class of Vietnamese consumers are willing to pay more for rice that is produced using methods that are beneficial to the environment. Results also indicate challenges to provide sustainably-produced rice to poorer groups of consumers. Originality/value: The study provides important context for consumer preferences within emerging economies. This also adds to a growing literature that uses the choice experiment method to estimate consumer valuation of the outcomes of various agricultural practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Choice Modeling; Emerging Economies; Impure Public Good; Rice; Sustainable Food Production; Willingness To Pay","","","","The corresponding author received financial support from the Global Engagement Office of the Sam M.

The primary objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting Vietnamese consumer intention to purchase safely certified vegetables (safe vegetables) based on an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 361 urban consumers in Hanoi city based on a stratified sampling technique, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the model. Findings: The results revealed that the extended TPB succeeded to predict 62% of the variance of intention to purchase safe vegetables. Attitude played the most important role in consumer intention. Notably, the attitude of consumers was the most largely influenced by subjective norms (social effects). Also, subjective norms had a direct effect on intention. Furthermore, consumer trust motivated a favorable attitude to increase purchase intention. The effects of past behavior on intention were verified as direct and indirect through subjective norm and trust combined with attitude. Few socio-demographic variables (e.g. age and education) were found to affect intention indirectly through attitude and subjective norm. Research limitations/implications: Further research on the relationship between intention and the actual purchase of safe food is needed. Originality/value: This extends the application of the TPB to predict consumer intention to purchase safely certified food in a developing country like Vietnam by examining both direct and indirect effects of socio-demographic variables, trust and past behavior on intention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Behavior; Food Safety; Intention; Safe Vegetables; Tpb; Vietnam","","","","This work was funded by QR Program, Kyushu University, Japan.

In response, government authorities plan to implement a wide range of AI-driven healthcare solutions. These include care robots that assist the physically handicapped or elderly, chatbots that provide anonymous online mental health consultation, and diagnostic software utilizing machine learning. Yet one of the most popular smart technologies to augment the nation's already overstrained and undermanned healthcare system is a little known but emerging emotional AI technologies, i.e., deep learning systems trained to read, classify, and respond to human emotions. These technologies are being sold on a commercial level not only to the public but also to rehabilitation centers, local hospitals, and senior citizen residences. Although the augmentation of healthcare services to intelligent machines may seem like a logical step in a country well-known for its long-standing affection toward robots, Japanese society is also known for its adherence to established social relations and traditional institutional practices, especially, in the realm of medical care. In order to gauge Japanese acceptance of emotion-sensing technology, we analyze a dataset of 245 visitors to clinics and hospitals in a typical suburban area in Japan using multiple linear regression. The results show that in general, senior and male patients perceive the emotional AI technology more negatively. For behavioral variables, patients' level of familiarity has positive correlations with attitudes toward emotional AI-based applications in private setting (β<inf>Familiarity_AttitudePri</inf>=0.346, p<0.001) and public setting (β<inf>Familiarity_PublicAttitude</inf>=0.297, p<0.001); while concern for losing control to AI has negative correlations with the attitudes' variables: private setting (β<inf>LosingControl_AttitudePri</inf>=−0.262,p=0.002) and public setting (β <inf>LosingControl_AttitudePub</inf>=-0.188, p=0.044). Interestingly, concerns over violation of privacy and discrimination are non-significant correlates, which contradict the emerging literature on this subject. We further contextualize the findings with insights afforded by an understanding of Japanese culture as well as the relevant literature on care robots in Japan. Finally, policy and education implications to promote emotional AI acceptance to the general and senior members of the society are provided. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai In Healthcare; Artificial Intelligence (ai); Emotional Ai (eai); Japan; Japanese Elderly Patients; Behavioral Research; Deep Learning; Engineering Education; Health Care; Hospitals; Learning Systems; Linear Regression; Aging Population; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare; Artificial Intelligence Technologies; Cross-sectional Surveys; Emotional Artificial Intelligence; Healthcare Systems; Healthcare Workers; Japan; Japanese Elderly Patient; Diagnosis; Aging Population; Artificial Intelligence; Elderly Care; Health Care; Machine Learning; Mental Health; Software","Behavioral research; Deep learning; Engineering education; Health care; Hospitals; Learning systems; Linear regression; Aging population; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence in healthcare; Artificial intelligence technologies; Cross-sectional surveys; Emotional artificial intelligence; Healthcare systems; Healthcare workers; Japan; Japanese elderly patient; Diagnosis; aging population; artificial intelligence; elderly care; health care; machine learning; mental health; software","","","Funding text 1: This study is part of the project “Emotional AI in Cities: Cross Cultural Lessons from UK and Japan on Designing for an Ethical Life” funded by JST -UKRI Joint Call on Artificial Intelligence and Society (2019), Grant No. JPMJRX19H6 .

However, these models lack a mechanism that can incorporate syntactic tendencies. Thus, attention-based neural networks are less accurate when dealing with complex syntactic relationships and long-span syntactically dependent utterances. To solve this problem, a neural network model combining a conditional random field and a graph convolutional network is proposed. The model uses a conditional random field chain to extract the opinion span of an aspect-specific word, integrates the contextual information within the opinion span to the global nodes through a multilayer graph convolutional network using the improved position decay function, and predicts the aspect-specific sentiment polarity labels by computing the vector expressions of the global nodes. This study addresses the problem of fluctuations in model accuracy when multiple aspect words exist in an utterance by introducing global nodes into a graph convolutional network. The proposed model performed well in the experiments on all four datasets tested. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis; Crf; Decay Function; Gcn; Natural Language Processing; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Graph Theory; Random Processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Aspect-level Sentiment Analyse; Convolutional Networks; Crf; Decay Function; Gcn; Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Random Fields; Sentiment Analysis","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Graph theory; Random processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Aspect-level sentiment analyse; Convolutional networks; CRF; Decay function; GCN; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Random fields; Sentiment analysis","","","This work was sponsored by the Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 - Major Project of New Generation Artificial Intelligence, China (No. 2020AAA0109300 ), Shanghai Science and Technology Young Talents Sailing Program, China (No. 19YF1418400 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62006150 ), Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan, China ( 22S31903700 , 21S31904200 ), Songjiang District Science and Technology Research Project, China (No. 19SJKJGG83 ), \u201CScience and Technology Innovation Action Plan\u201D of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission for Social Development Project, China (No. 21DZ1204900 ), and the Shanghai Local Capacity Enhancement Project, China (No. 21010501500 ).","Cambria, Erik, Affective Computing and Sentiment Analysis, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 31, 2, pp. 102-107, (2016); Majumder, Navonil, Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification with Multitask Learning, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 34, 3, pp. 38-43, (2019); Zheng, Lijuan, Sentimental feature selection for sentiment analysis of chinese online reviews, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 9, 1, pp. 75-84, (2018); Bahdanau, Dzmitry, Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, (2015); Tang, Duyu, Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network, pp. 214-224, (2016); Interactive Attention Networks for Aspect Level Sentiment Classification, (2017); Kipf, Thomas N., Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks, (2017); Zhang, Chen, Aspect-based sentiment classification with aspect-specific graph convolutional networks, pp. 4568-4578, (2019); Xu, Lu, Aspect sentiment classification with aspect-specific opinion spans, pp. 3561-3567, (2020); Icml, (2001)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144051390"

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of the participation on farmer’s income as well as the major factors that affect the participation in cooperatives by the vegetable farmers in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: The study used primary data collected from vegetable farmers in Vietnam. This study utilized propensity score matching to avoid initial selection bias. The differences between participants and nonparticipants will be adjusted by matching each membership individual to a nonmember based on similar observable characteristics by summarizing the conditional probability of a member given pretreatment characteristics. Findings: This study demonstrates that participation in cooperatives is significantly affected by ethnicity, age of household head, labor involving vegetable production and extension service access. The results of this study also confirm that agricultural cooperatives have positive effects on member farmers to enhance income and that participants – on average – have a higher income than nonparticipants. Research limitations/implications: The method cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias due to unobserved differences between participants and even an appropriate comparison group. Originality/value: This study contributes to an improved understanding about impacts of cooperatives on farmers’ income in developing and emerging economies.

The other objective was to provide recommendations for policymakers and manufacturers to promote and customize cargo EVs to meet the requirements of carriers in the LMD sector. Design/methodology/approach: In this study the authors constructed a research framework that adjusted and extended the original technology acceptance model (TAM). The proposed model combines eight psychological factors, including attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement, face consciousness, financial incentive policy and carrier intention, in which four factors, namely attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention, were obtained from the original TAM and the four remaining factors, namely perceived risk, public engagement, face consciousness and financial incentive policy, were added. Findings: The results showed that psychological factors such as attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement and face consciousness might affect carriers' intentions to use electric cargo vehicles in LMD service in Vietnamese cities. These results agree with the previous studies and confirm that attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, public engagement and face consciousness might be important for shaping intention to use electric cargo vehicles in emerging markets. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations, first, the data were collected in Vietnam, a country with weak academic contributions. Therefore, these findings might not be generalizable to other areas. The authors expect to apply the same research framework to other countries to explore the similarities and differences across the countries. Second, the authors conducted the surveys in three cities; except for Hanoi, the other two cities are not really large markets in the LMD service sector. Third, the authors ignored the relationship between the demographic characteristics and electric cargo vehicles. Further studies should address this gap. Practical implications: Based on the findings, manufacturers should ensure the high-quality performance of electric cargo vehicles in terms of extending driving range and shortening recharging time. Policymakers should develop the roadmaps for electric cargo vehicles, starting from switching from conventional cargo motorcycles to electric motorcycles. In addition, developing public charging infrastructure should be prioritized, which is the fundamental basis for operating electric cargo vehicles. Finally, manufacturers should research and develop a product that would improve the reputation of carriers because carriers with higher face consciousness are more likely to pursue brand-name and high-priced products in order to enhance their reputation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in two aspects: First, the authors investigated intentions to use electric cargo vehicles in LMD service, which is rare from other studies, and they further identified the psychological determinants of carriers' intentions. Second, the findings increase the knowledge of carriers' intentions and suggest implications for policymakers and manufacturers to promote the adoption of electric cargo vehicles in last-mile deliver service. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carriers' Intentions; Electric Cargo Vehicles; Last-mile Delivery; Psychological Factors","","","","","Acheampong, Ransford A., Capturing the behavioural determinants behind the adoption of autonomous vehicles: Conceptual frameworks and measurement models to predict public transport, sharing and ownership trends of self-driving cars, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 62, pp. 349-375, (2019); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Allen, Julian, Understanding the impact of e-commerce on last-mile light goods vehicle activity in urban areas: The case of London, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 61, pp. 325-338, (2018); Anosike, Anthony Ikechukwu, Exploring the challenges of electric vehicle adoption in final mile parcel delivery, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 26, 6, pp. 683-707, (2023); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1991); Bao, Yeqing, Face Consciousness and Risk Aversion: Do They Affect Consumer Decision-Making?, Psychology and Marketing, 20, 8, pp. 733-755, (2003); Bearth, Angela, Are risk or benefit perceptions more important for public acceptance of innovative food technologies: A meta-analysis, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 49, pp. 14-23, (2016); Buckley, Lisa D., Psychosocial factors associated with intended use of automated vehicles: A simulated driving study, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 115, pp. 202-208, (2018); Carley, Sanya R., Intent to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle: A survey of early impressions in large US cites, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 18, 1, pp. 39-45, (2013); Cegarra-Navarro, Juan Gabriel, Technology knowledge and governance: Empowering citizen engagement and participation, Government Information Quarterly, 31, 4, pp. 660-668, (2014)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17586550; 09574093","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133956160"

According to its recent Power Development Plan 7, coal-fired power sources account for almost half of both total installed capacity and production of electricity, and this is expected to increase to more than half of the power sources by 2030. Regarding finance, the increasing Chinese dominance is expected because of the lack of other financial resources caused by the country’s heavy debt ratio and international withdrawal from coal financing. Consequently, least cost systems will be installed and implemented, which could cause serious environmental damage on a local scale.

The first step in understanding innovation implementation is to identify its driving factors. However, these factors remain unclear in the context of agricultural corporations. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors associated with the product innovation implementation in Japanese agricultural corporations. A probit model was used to identify these driven factors by using the data of 308 corporations from the national survey in 2019. The results showed that 20.5% (nâ€‰=â€‰63) of corporations were rice corporations. Most corporations (38.6%, nâ€‰=â€‰199) generated an annual sales revenue of 100 to 300 million yen. Further, 50.0% of corporations implemented product innovation, that is, these corporations started to produce and sell new or significantly improved goods or launched new or significantly improved services. The results also show that corporations that generate high annual sales, seek high number of sales, aim for profit margins of 5–15%, and believe more strongly in their ability to innovate tend to implement product innovation. Contrastingly, corporations that have a profit margin between 1 and 10% are less likely to implement product innovation than those breaking even. Corporations that mainly deal in facility vegetables or livestock products also tend to implement product innovation less than the corporations mainly selling rice. The corporations with higher self-evaluation in new product and technology development tend to implement more product innovation. Overall, the results suggest that a certain level of annual sales might be required for innovation, innovating farms seek growth and set high targets, and innovations are stimulated by hight self-evaluation in new product and technology development. Therefore, to promote product innovation in Japanese agricultural corporations, these factors should be considered. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Castillo-Valero, Juan Sebastián, Factors that determine innovation in agrifood firms, Agronomy, 11, 5, (2021); Feder, Gershon, Adoption of agricultural innovations in developing countries: a survey., Economic Development and Cultural Change, 33, 2, pp. 255-298, (1985); Hashi, Iraj, The impact of innovation activities on firm performance using a multi-stage model: Evidence from the Community Innovation Survey 4, Research Policy, 42, 2, pp. 353-366, (2013); Läpple, Doris, Measuring and understanding the drivers of agricultural innovation: Evidence from Ireland, Food Policy, 51, pp. 1-8, (2015); Fy 2018 Summary of the Annual Report on Food Agriculture and Rural Areas in Japan, (2019); Smart Agriculture Practice in Ricefarming and Perspective of Farm in Nextgeneration, (2019); Agriculture and Forestry Statistics Publishing Inc, (2021); 10th Asian Society Agricultural Economist International Conference, (2021); Oslo Manual Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Innovation Data, (2005); Innovation in Firms A Microeconomic Perspective, (2009)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","","9789811990854; 9789811990861","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173404685"

However, there is no study on profit efficiency of VietGAP tea producers, which are therefore barriers for farmers and policymakers in terms of extending the tea production practice in Vietnam. Thus, this study investigated the profit efficiency of tea production practices using a stochastic profit frontier function. We applied propensity score matching to control for self- selection in assessing the profit efficiency of VietGAP and conventional tea farming. Our results indicated that the average profit efficiency of tea farmers was around 74%, suggesting 26% of profit was lost due to inefficiency. Furthermore, significant different profit efficiency was observed between the two farmer groups. We further found that tea farmers with larger production scale, better irrigation system, accessing extension service are more likely to adopt VietGAP tea practices than others are. Thus, public policies should focus on improving profit efficiency and facilitating adoption of eco-friendly production practice, and also supporting innovations to improve farmers’ production conditions, including the access to extension service, irrigation system, enlarged farm size, and labor-saving machinery. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abdulai, Awudu Mumin, Structural adjustment and economic efficiency of rice farmers in Northern Ghana, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 48, 3, pp. 503-520, (2000); Making Markets Work Better for the Poor the Value Chain for Tea in Vietnam Prospects for Participation of the Poor, (2004); Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Wasim Aktar, Md, Impact of pesticides use in agriculture: Their benefits and hazards, Interdisciplinary Toxicology, 2, 1, pp. 1-12, (2009); Ali, Mubarak, Economic efficiency of small farmers in a changing world: A survey of recent evidence, Journal of International Development, 3, 1, pp. 1-27, (1991); Ali, Mubarik, Profit efficiency among Basmati rice producers in Pakistan Punjab, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 71, 2, pp. 303-310, (1989); Arnade, Carlos Anthony, Estimating a profit function in the presence of inefficiency: An application to Russian agriculture, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 27, 1, pp. 94-113, (2002); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Caliendo, Marco, Some practical guidance for the implementation of propensity score matching, Journal of Economic Surveys, 22, 1, pp. 31-72, (2008)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","","9789811990854; 9789811990861","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173398414"

Primary data were collected from a Japan nationwide questionnaire survey on “Business Development and Innovation in Agricultural Corporation Management” in 2019. Data of 183 agricultural corporations in Japan were analyzed through descriptive analysis and negative binomial modeling. The results showed that 175 out of 183 corporations had adopted at least one ICT&SF technology until 2019, indicating an overall adoption rate of 95.6%. Majority (84.7%) of corporations were limited companies and stock companies, and 86.9% of the corporations were qualified to own farmlands. Regarding the profile of corporate representatives, over one third of the representatives graduated from universities. Based on the empirical results, corporate forms, eligibility to own farmland, sales targets, profit targets, main product and self-evaluation of ICT utilization and information management significantly affected the adoption of ICT&SF technologies adoption. In terms of the characteristics of corporate representatives, those who graduated from specialized schools and vocational colleges tended to adopt more ICT&SF technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Bucci, Giorgia, Factors affecting ict adoption in agriculture: A case study in italy, Quality - Access to Success, 20, S2, pp. 122-129, (2019); Cameron, A.

Following these types of innovations, this chapter categorizes the types of agricultural innovations adopted in Asian countries over time into three main groups. These are product and process innovation, marketing and organizational innovation, and social innovations by institutional changes and welfare. Measuring the impact of agricultural innovations on farming and rural welfare is also summarized on three aspects, namely, production, economics, and welfare in Asian countries.

Studies have yet to investigate not only the institutional factors affecting VietGAHP adoption in household pig farming, but also the impact of such adoption on its criteria’ implementation. The objective of this chapter is to investigate the factors associated with VietGAHP adoption in household pig production and its impact on implementing its criteria. A Probit model was used to directly indicate the determinants of VietGAHP adoption, and a z test revealed the VietGAHP’s impact by comparing the differences in each criterion’s compliance rates between adopter and non-adopter groups. The results demonstrate that the factors positively contributing to VietGAHP adoption include gender, training, household income, and veterinary services, with the training factor as a substantial contributor. The factors presenting a challenge to this adoption included farm size, the number of family members participating in pig-raising, off-farm income, and biogas, with the latter an especially pivotal factor. Moreover, an expected result of the government’s support was that VietGAHP adoption had a positive impact on 9 out 15 compulsory practices and 8 of 14 optional practices. These imply that to attain food safety and environmental protection goals through a public GAP program for pig production, traditional adoption factors—including a male farmer status, training, household wealth, and veterinary services—remain key pillars on which government policies should focus. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Ali, Jaffar, Farmer’s perception regarding constraints faced in adoption of dairy farming practices in Sindh province, Pakistan, Tropical Animal Health and Production, 51, 6, pp. 1707-1715, (2019); Asfaw, Solomon, Impact of modern agricultural technologies on smallholder welfare: Evidence from Tanzania and Ethiopia, Food Policy, 37, 3, pp. 283-295, (2012); Manual on Good Agricultural Practices Gap, (2016); Baumgart-Getz, Adam, Why farmers adopt best management practice in the United States: A meta-analysis of the adoption literature, Journal of Environmental Management, 96, 1, pp. 17-25, (2012); Brouder, Sylvie M., The impact of conservation agriculture on smallholder agricultural yields: A scoping review of the evidence, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 187, pp. 11-32, (2014); Coulibaly, Jeanne Y., Adoption of agroforestry and the impact on household food security among farmers in Malawi, Agricultural Systems, 155, pp. 52-69, (2017); Feder, Gershon, Adoption of agricultural innovations in developing countries: a survey., Economic Development and Cultural Change, 33, 2, pp. 255-298, (1985); Ghimire, Raju, Factors Affecting Adoption of Improved Rice Varieties among Rural Farm Households in Central Nepal, Rice Science, 22, 1, pp. 35-43, (2015); Journal of Economics and Developments, (2016); Gillespie, Jeffrey M., Why don't producers adopt best management practices?

Recently, the proportion of high-tech agricultural products has increased; however, output quality and quantity have not reached the expectations. There are many possible reasons, one of which is that farmers lack skill, experience, and knowledge to receive and generate information sources. This chapter estimated the technical efficiency levels and identified the information factors that influence the technical inefficiency of crop farmers in the northwest highland of Vietnam using farm-level data. The results show that there are significant opportunities to increase technical inefficiency and no farm has full technical efficiency. Agricultural information from printed materials and frequent watching of television were significantly and negatively related to technical inefficiency. This indicates that if farmers read more agricultural information from printed materials and watch television related to social life at appropriate times, the technical efficiency of crop farms would increase. Based on the results, some suggestions are proposed to optimize crop-farm technical efficiency and increase the effectiveness of using information sources. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Japanese Journal of Farm Management, (2013); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Battese, George E., ESTIMATION OF A PRODUCTION FRONTIER MODEL: WITH APPLICATION TO THE PASTORAL ZONE OF EASTERN AUSTRALIA, Australian Journal of Agricultural Economics, 21, 3, pp. 169-179, (1977); Digital Economy and Digital Transformation in Vietnam, (2020); Boz, Ismet, Factors influencing the adoption of maize in Kahramanmaras province of Turkey, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 33, SUPPL. 3, pp. 431-440, (2005); Bravo-Ureta, Boris E., Technical, economic, and allocative efficiency in peasant farming: Evidence from the Dominican Republic, Developing Economies, 35, 1, pp. 48-67, (1997); Guide to Frontier Version 4 1 A Computer Program for Stochastic Frontier Production and Cost Function Estimation, (1996); Coelli, Tim J., Identification of factors which influence the technical inefficiency of Indian farmers, Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 40, 2, pp. 103-128, (1996); Coelli, Tim J., An introduction to efficiency and productivity analysis, pp. 1-349, (2005)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","","9789811990854; 9789811990861","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173320140"

In the first step, we review prior research to identify the service-oriented supply chain’s distinctive features and typical risks. In the second step, the resonant effect of these risks on service-oriented supply chain performance is examined by an empirical study in the construction sector that was hit hard during COVID-19. In doing so, a model comparing the single impacts of risks on supply chain performance to the theoretical model was developed to confirm the resonant effect mechanism. Obtained from 196 service-oriented firms in Vietnam’s construction, our study found that the resonant effect model explained 63% of service-oriented supply chain performance variance versus 46.3% in the comparative model. The influence of a single risk on supply chain performance is also more significant, proving the resonant mechanism influence. Another interesting result is the low-impact demand risk on supply chain performance, reinforcing the service-oriented supply chain advantage. The notion for resonant effect reduction is minimising the coefficient of “a” to limit/eliminate risks’ relationship. Hence, the proposed resonant effect model can serve as a guide. Our recommendation to embrace supply chain management strategies, such as avoidance, speculation, and postponement, should be balanced with acceptable cost/benefit trade-offs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Resonant Effect; Risk Management; Service-dominant Logic; Supply Chain Management; Supply Chain Risk Management","","","","","Truong Quang, Huy, Supply chain management practices and firms’ operational performance, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 34, 2, pp. 176-193, (2017); Duong, Thi Binh An, Supply chain management and organizational performance: the resonant influence, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 36, 7, pp. 1053-1077, (2019); Lusch, Robert Frank, Reframing supply chain management: A service-dominant logic perspective, Journal of Supply Chain Management, 47, 1, pp. 14-18, (2011); Truong Quang, Huy, The push effect of risks on supply chain performance: service-oriented firms, Business Process Management Journal, 25, 7, pp. 1734-1758, (2019); Tokman, Mert, Supply chain networks and service-dominant logic: Suggestions for future research, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 41, 7, pp. 717-726, (2011); Randall, Wesley S., Service-dominant logic and supply chain management: Are we there yet?, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 44, 1, pp. 113-131, (2014); Altuntas-Vural, Ceren, Service-dominant logic and supply chain management: a systematic literature review, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 32, 8, pp. 1109-1124, (2017); Maas, Steffen, Supply chain services from a service-dominant perspective: A content analysis, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 44, 1, pp. 58-79, (2014); Flint, Daniel John, The supply chain management of shopper marketing as viewed through a service ecosystem lens, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 44, 1, pp. 23-38, (2014); Truong Quang, Huy, Supply chain risk management: Manufacturing- and service-oriented firms, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 29, 2, pp. 218-239, (2018)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","","9789819915453; 9789819915446","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171497812"

Those activities are strengthened by developing IT link and information sharing with suppliers and by customers. Research Limitation/Implication: Sample size is relatively small due to limited time and resources; subjective measurement of constructs are limitations that can be addressed in future research. Originality/Value of paper: This paper fills the gap in literature related with application of supply chain information in developing countries. It indicated that IT links should be regarded as the platform for information sharing among supply chain partners which lead to higher supply chain performance.

The former often depends on the latter (which includes the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual sub-elements). Trip satisfaction, nevertheless, is usually measured after the trip has finished. Thus, a lag effect may have certain impacts on the evaluations. In addition, the influences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on tourists’satisfaction, in general, and their emotions, in particular, have not yet been considered. The purpose of this study is to examine tourists’ in-situ emotions by tracing their antecedents, including the above-mentioned factors and those beyond them. Using data collected from one young tourist sample (n = 298) in Vietnam, this study found that the intrapersonal element of “nonverbal communication skills,” the interpersonal element of “relationship satisfaction,” and the contextual elements of “destination attributes” and “symbolic values” were influencers of these tourists’ positive emotions. The situational elements of “COVID-19 self-efficacy” and “COVID-19 fear” did not have positive impacts.

Theoretical framework: The study considers institutions from the perspective of governance institutions. Accordingly, the concept of government institutions is related to the country's organizational foundation in terms of governance, implying institutional quality. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses GMM method and also choose the Zscore as the primary variable for bank stability. Findings: The results show that institutional quality increases the stability of banks. Moreover, with the threshold model, the results show that countries with institutional quality above the threshold will increase the stability of banks. In addition, macroeconomic and banking characteristics variables such as total assets, income diversification, quality of control, inflation, and GDP growth rate have a high significance in the model. Research, Practical & Social implications: The study shows The study's empirical results have specific policy implications for the Government in implementing policies related to institutional quality to improve bank stability. Originality/value: there are not many researches done to investigate institutional quality to improve bank stability. Moreover, from economic crisis, the matter of banking stability is among main concerns of many researches. Second, previous researches just focus on the aspect of corruption and ignore other aspects or other factors.

One important reason for this limitation is the absence of valid and reliable measurement of risk, resulting in the impossibility to discriminate between risk constructs. Therefore, the current study is performed to develop and then validate a measurement scale of risk in sustainable construction SCs. The data are collected from a large-scale survey supported by the Japanese government to promote sustainable socioeconomic development for the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region, with the participation of 283 firms in Vietnam. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are used to test the reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the risk constructs. The results indicate that all tests strongly support the measurement scale, and seven reliable risk constructs are identified including supply, demand, internal processes, information, financial, time, and environmental risks. This study also presents opportunities for further developing research on risk management (especially the three phases: risk assessment, risk mitigation, and risk monitoring) in sustainable construction SCs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Measurement Scale; Risk; Scale Development; Supply Chains; Sustainable Construction; Factor Analysis; Multivariant Analysis; Reliability Analysis; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Sustainable Development; 'current; Construction Supply Chain; Identification Of Risks; Large Scale Surveys; Measurement Scale; Measurements Of; Reliable Measurement; Risks Assessments; Scale Development; Sustainable Construction; Supply Chains; Asean; Construction; Factor Analysis; Risk Factor; Supply Chain Management; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Viet Nam","Factor analysis; Multivariant analysis; Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sustainable development; 'current; Construction supply chain; Identification of risks; Large scale surveys; Measurement scale; Measurements of; Reliable measurement; Risks assessments; Scale development; Sustainable construction; Supply chains; ASEAN; construction; factor analysis; risk factor; supply chain management; sustainability; sustainable development; Viet Nam","","","The authors would like to thank Van Lang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for funding this research.

In this backdrop, a number of studies document the causal links between hot money and financial markets. Accordingly, the study examines the causal relationship among hot money, equities, and real estate assets in the small-scale economy of Pakistan. For this purpose, we employ various time series techniques such as the JJ Co-integration test, Granger causality tests, Impulse Response Functions (IRF), and Variance Decomposition Analysis (VDC). The findings validate the long-term association between speculative funds and underlying investment markets. The results uncover unidirectional causality from investment markets to hot money in Pakistan. However, the lack of a bi-directional relationship among the underlying variables indicates that hot money is not a major driver of soaring prices in equities and real estate assets. Alternatively, developing the underlying markets attracts speculative cash inflows into the economy. The findings of the study highlight some useful implications for investors and regulators. For instance, the study's findings present valuable insights for international investors seeking diversification opportunities in small-scale economies such as Pakistan. Also, the regulators in the underlying economy can utilize the study findings to formulate an optimal model to manage international capital flows. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal Relationship; Hot Money; Real Estate Sector; Stock Market; Capital Flow; Economy Of Scale; Financial Market; Stock Market; Pakistan","capital flow; economy of scale; financial market; stock market; Pakistan","","","The article is sponsored by the Grant-in-Aid for the Excellent Young Researcher of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT) and the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (No. 22K13432) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).","undefined, (2021); Financial Capital Flows in the US Balance of Payments, (1968); Journal of Applied Economics, (1998); Chari, Varadarajan V., Hot money, Journal of Political Economy, 111, 6, pp. 1262-1292, (2003); Chen, Junhua, One decade of urban housing reform in China: Urban housing price dynamics and the role of migration and urbanization, 1995-2005, Habitat International, 35, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Chiang, Mingchu, Importance of proper monetary liquidity: Sustainable development of the housing and stock markets, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 21, pp. 1-21, (2020); Dekker, Arie, Equity market linkages in the Asia Pacific region: A comparison of the orthogonalised and generalised VAR approaches, Global Finance Journal, 12, 1, pp. 1-33, (2001); Domowitz, Ian, Market segmentation and stock prices: Evidence from an emerging market, Journal of Finance, 52, 3, pp. 1059-1085, (1997); Ferreira, Miguel A., The colors of investors' money: The role of institutional investors around the world, Journal of Financial Economics, 88, 3, pp. 499-533, (2008); Filer, Larry H., Large capital inflows to Korea: The traditional developing economy story?, Journal of Asian Economics, 15, 1, pp. 99-110, (2004)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","1331677X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138249497"

By using consumer price index (CPI) data from 18 developed countries to evaluate these models, we find that the GARCH models are generally outperformed by their stochastic volatility counterparts. Furthermore, the stochastic volatility in mean (SV-M) model is shown to be the best for all 18 countries considered. The paper also examines which model characteristics play a main role in modelling inflation rates. It turns out that inflation volatility feedback is a crucial feature that we should take into consideration when modelling inflation rates. The relevance of a leverage effect, however, is found to be rather ambiguous. Finally, the forecasting results using the log predictive score confirm these findings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayes Factor; Garch; Inflation Volatility; Log Predictive Score; Marginal Likelihood; Stochastic Volatility; Bayesian Analysis; Comparative Study; Inflation; Modeling; Stochasticity","Bayesian analysis; comparative study; inflation; modeling; stochasticity","","","I would like to thank Shinichi Nishiyama and Shuhei Takahashi for helpful comments and suggestions.

In construction, some review-based papers have been done to cover various issues in supply chain risk management (SCRM) such as risks associated with the adoption of supply chain management. However, limited review papers have been conducted to comprehensively classify supply chain risk (SCR) types and/or analyze SCRM processes (i.e. risk identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and risk monitoring). Therefore, this study aims to overcome such shortcomings of previous literature reviews by applying a review process with six specific stages. Accordingly, 30 relevant papers published during over the last two decades are first extracted from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Then, descriptive and content analyses are used to review these papers. It is found that a considerable amount of focus has been devoted to identifying and assessing risks while mitigating and monitoring risks have not yet received much attention from researchers. Finally, research gaps and opportunities are presented to guide further studies. This paper contributes to the extant literature by conducting a comprehensive view of various past studies across SCRM processes in construction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction; Review; Supply Chain; Supply Chain Risk; Supply Chain Risk Management","","","","","Abas, Muhammad, Assessment of critical risk and success factors in construction supply chain: a case of Pakistan, International Journal of Construction Management, 22, 12, pp. 2258-2266, (2022); Ahmed, Ammar, A review of techniques for risk management in projects, Benchmarking, 14, 1, pp. 22-36, (2007); Aloini, Davide, Supply chain management: A review of implementation risks in the construction industry, Business Process Management Journal, 18, 5, pp. 735-761, (2012); Aqlan, Faisal, Supply chain risk modelling and mitigation, International Journal of Production Research, 53, 18, pp. 5640-5656, (2015); Blackhurst, Jennifer V., Supplier risk assessment and monitoring for the automotive industry, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 38, 2, pp. 143-165, (2008); Bode, Christoph, Structural drivers of upstream supply chain complexity and the frequency of supply chain disruptions, Journal of Operations Management, 36, pp. 215-228, (2015); Bode, Christoph, Understanding responses to supply chain disruptions: Insights from information processing and resource dependence perspectives, Academy of Management Journal, 54, 4, pp. 833-856, (2011); Bühler, Andreas, Accounting for external turbulence of logistics organizations via performance measurement systems, Supply Chain Management, 21, 6, pp. 694-708, (2016); Logistics Management, (2007); Carr, Vaughan J., A fuzzy approach to construction project risk assessment and analysis: Construction project risk management system, Advances in Engineering Software, 32, 10-11, pp. 847-857, (2001)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","15623599; 23312327","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124372403"

Especially, these consumer-targeted traits pursued in GE applications could rise consumer acceptance. Consumer-targeted traits coupled with transgene-free crops has created a more balanced risk-benefit perception and given momentum to GE foods production. Nevertheless, the public has failed to distinguish bio-technologies, and regulators are treating GM and GE foods alike. Thus, it is vital to increase knowledge, communication and policy orientation.

Contributing toward a sustainable and zero waste future, DR was utilized as raw material for cellulose and activated carbon production. A chemical delignification method was adopted to valorize DR into cellulose, while carbonization and subsequent KOH activation steps were used to convert the DR into activated carbon. The resulting materials exhibited high adsorption capacity toward Cr6+ (154.2 and 223.3 mg/g for cellulose and activated carbon, respectively). The activated carbon derived from DR exhibited a faster adsorption rate of Cr6+ compared to cellulose and raw DR. The adsorption of Cr6+ by DR-derived adsorbents exhibited a monolayer tendency, with isotherm and kinetics data following the Khan and pseudo-second-order models.

In particular, the global numbers of mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68% from 1970 to 2016. One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably, perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast, perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government’s and international organizations’ funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We would like to send our gratitude to our colleagues, family, and friends for supporting us during the research, especially Prof. Vuong Quan Hoang (Phenikaa University).

However, understanding of service quality and satisfaction relations has been limited. This study seeks an appropriate method to demonstrate the nature of service quality-satisfaction relations. Thereby, research results can be methodologically, theoretically, and empirically defensible. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) and the three-factor theory, the most widely preferred for public transport service quality prioritization based on the importance of service factors to rider satisfaction, will be utilized. The study takes transit service in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, to demonstrate that the three-factor theory, which has been limitedly utilized despite being more advantageous and robust, is superior to the IPA. Although the extent to which the service quality factors affect satisfaction varied across rider segments, the types of service quality factors were found consistent. For example, captive riders considered all service factors as performance. Non-captive riders considered the environment factor as excitement. No basic factor was found across rider groups. This study contributes to the limited understanding of the non-linear and asymmetric relations between service quality and satisfaction of various rider groups, which is rarely found in transit service quality literature. Furthermore, it introduced a case study of Vietnamese urban transit services for the first time. It suggests that enhancing passenger information, rider care, and comfort are recommended as the most practical and economical measures in the short run. However, the city government should improve availability and accessibility to promote public transport ridership in the long run. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Importance-performance Analysis; Public Transport; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segments; Service Quality; Three-factor Theory; Factor Analysis; Quality Control; Importance-performance Analysis; Prioritization; Public Transport; Public Transport Service; Rider Satisfaction; Rider Segment; Service Quality; Service Satisfaction; Three-factor Theory; Transit Services; Quality Of Service; Performance Assessment; Prioritization; Public Transport; Service Quality; Strategic Approach; Viet Nam","Factor analysis; Quality control; Importance-performance analysis; Prioritization; Public transport; Public transport service; Rider satisfaction; Rider segment; Service Quality; Service satisfaction; Three-factor theory; Transit services; Quality of service; performance assessment; prioritization; public transport; service quality; strategic approach; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the World Bank for the data.

Since 1986, Vietnam has adopted an open economic policy and promoted trade activities. Therefore, Vietnam’s exports have significantly increased and contributed to economic development. The benefits of exports are undeniable, but Vietnam also faces serious environmental problems caused by these activities. This paper analyzes the impact of Vietnam’s export activities on economics and the environment through comparison between carbon emissions and value-added embodied in exports using an input–output model, then provides some recommendations to adjust Vietnam's export strategy in the future. The main findings indicate that carbon dioxide emissions (CO<inf>2</inf>) embodied in exports have increased from 2006 to 2015. The carbon intensity of exports increases, while the value-added intensity decreases. As compared with production for the domestic market, production for domestic demand creates faster value-added and slower carbon emissions than production for exports. This study suggests that Vietnam should reform its export structure alongside technological improvements and other policy adjustments to curb Vietnam’s growing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Emissions; Economics; Environment; Exports; Value-added; Vietnam","","","","I am grateful to the reviewers for suggestions that greatly improved the paper.","Banerjee, Suvajit, Addressing the Drivers of Carbon Emissions Embodied in Indian Exports: An Index Decomposition Analysis, Foreign Trade Review, 54, 4, pp. 300-333, (2019); Su, Bin, Input-output analysis of CO2 emissions embodied in trade: Competitive versus non-competitive imports, Energy Policy, 56, pp. 83-87, (2013); Journal of Economics and International Finance, (2011); Chaponnière, Jean Raphaë, Vietnam's export-led growth model and competition with China, Economie Internationale, 118, 2, pp. 101-130, (2009); Chen, Xikang, The estimation of domestic value-added and employment induced by exports: An application to Chinese exports to the United States, pp. 64-82, (2008); Dietzenbacher, Erik, Trade, production fragmentation, and China's carbon dioxide emissions, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 64, 1, pp. 88-101, (2012); Taking Stock an Update on Vietnams Recent Economic Developments Special Focus Reform Priorities for Reducing Trade Costs and Enhancing Competitiveness in Vietnam English, (2018); Eora Global Mrio, (2015); Fan, Bin, Trade openness and carbon leakage: Empirical evidence from China's industrial sector, Energies, 12, 6, (2019); Peters, Glen P., From production-based to consumption-based national emission inventories, Ecological Economics, 65, 1, pp. 13-23, (2008)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21932409","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138062108"

It shows that the conceptual subtleties in the conceptualization of nature often hide wider and deeper cosmological mismatches. It concludes by suggesting that these diverse voices need to be represented in global reports on sustainability, which can be fostered by the direct involvement of experts from diverse traditions of thought who have access and interpretative knowledge of sources in languages other than English.

Estimation results show strong evidence of the nonlinear relationship between the two variables. The influence of entrepreneurship density on natural resource rents is subject to two different regimes. In low- and upper-middle-income countries, an increase in entrepreneurship density increases natural resource rents to a certain level, but it reduces the rents afterwards. In high-income countries, the relationship is reversed.

Since MSMEs are diverse, however, the severity of the pandemic's impact on them varies considerably depending on their characteristics. Using online survey data of MSMEs from eight developing economies in South, Southeast, and Northeast Asia, this paper attempts to deepen our understanding of the impact of the pandemic on MSMEs, especially their employment, sales revenue, and cash flow. It also characterizes those firms that began participating in online commerce and tries to determine how their use of online commerce and their employment are related in this difficult time. This paper also examines the government support that MSMEs have received and the extent to which it has satisfied their support needs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash Shortage; Covid-19; Digitalization; Employment; Micro, Small And Medium Enterprises (msmes); Sales","","","","We are grateful to Daisuke Miyakawa for his helpful comments.

Data for analysis were obtained from direct interviews with households in Quang Dien and Phong Dien coastal plain districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed to gain insight into factors driving household rehabilitation. The findings accentuated improvements in women's post-flood resilience as a result of effective interventions from communities, authorities and NGOs. Diversifying livelihoods into the non-agricultural sector was also an important factor to shorten the rehabilitation processes. Additionally, the results emphasized the efficacy of social interactions, notably between relatives and informal groups, after floods. The potential negative consequences of reliance on government support in household rehabilitation efforts are also preliminarily discussed.

These soils cannot be reused directly cause of its weakness in strength properties. Hence, this study focuses on improving mechanical properties of waste soil by using cement and corn husk fiber. The environment has also benefited from using corn husk fiber since corn husk is agricultural by-product. In order to evaluate the impact of corn husk fiber and cement on mechanical characteristics of waste soil, a series of laboratory experiments containing tension and compression test is carried out. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test is conducted to investigate interaction between fibers and soil-cement matrix. Fiber content from 0 to 1% by dry soil mass and corn husk lengths of 10 and 30 mm are used in this research. The results present that strength properties of cemented soil are enhanced when fiber is added. The most improvements corresponding to compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and direct tensile strength are 30.6%, 206.1%, and 27.9%, respectively. A strong interaction between fibers and soil-cement matrix observed from SEM results in the improvement of strength properties of cemented soil. Fiber inclusion contributes to the more ductile and durable behavior under loading. Fiber length and fiber content have a remarkable effect on the cemented soil behavior. The increase in fiber length and content leads to the increase in residual stress and the decrease in loss of post-peak stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compressive Strength; Corn Husk Fiber; Direct Tensile Strength; Fiber-cement-stabilized Soil; Soil Improvement; Agricultural Wastes; Compression Testing; Fibers; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Soil Cement; Soil Testing; Soils; Tensile Strength; Cement-stabilized Soils; Corn Husk Fiber; Corn Husks; Direct Tensile Strengths; Fiber Cements; Fiber-cement-stabilized Soil; Fibers Content; Soils Improvement; Strength Property; Waste Soils; Compressive Strength","Agricultural wastes; Compression testing; Fibers; Scanning electron microscopy; Soil cement; Soil testing; Soils; Tensile strength; Cement-stabilized soils; Corn husk fiber; Corn husks; Direct tensile strengths; Fiber cements; Fiber-cement-stabilized soil; Fibers content; Soils improvement; Strength property; Waste soils; Compressive strength","","","The authors would like to thank Hiroshi Takahashi Laboratory and Hideyuki Takahashi Laboratory, Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Tohoku University to help and support this research.

This requires that teacher education institutes reorient and redefine their outcome standards as well as redesign their training programs accordingly to incorporate and implement Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Although many efforts have been made to promote ESD in teacher training, little information is available regarding to what extent ESD is integrated in teacher training programs or curricula. This study examines how ESD is incorporated in teacher training programs in terms of learning content, learning outcomes and didactic approach, through analyzing 429 course syllabi offered by the Hanoi National University of Education (HNUE) in Vietnam. HNUE training programs were found to contain some elements of ESD but they lack coherence or systematic inclusion. The results suggest needed strategic changes at organizational (university) and individual (instructor) levels to improve ESD in teacher education. This paper contributes to the discussion on the implementation of a holistic curricular assessment approach for three aspects of ESD (learning content, learning outcomes and didactic approach) and highlights the ongoing need for improving curricular assessment strategies for sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Curriculum Assessment; Education For Sustainable Development (esd); Higher Education; Teacher Education; Curricula; Electrostatic Devices; Personnel Training; Planning; Teaching; Curriculum Assessment; Education For Sustainable Development; High Educations; Learning Contents; Learning Outcome; Teacher Education; Teacher Training; Teachers Training Programs; Training Program; Sustainable Development","Curricula; Electrostatic devices; Personnel training; Planning; Teaching; Curriculum assessment; Education for sustainable development; High educations; Learning contents; Learning outcome; Teacher education; Teacher training; Teachers training programs; Training program; Sustainable development","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 503.01-2020.302 .","Albareda-Tiana, Sílvia, Implementing the sustainable development goals at University level, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 19, 3, pp. 473-497, (2018); Albareda-Tiana, Sílvia, Holistic approaches to develop sustainability and research competencies in pre-service teacher training, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 10, (2018); Implementing Sustainability in Higher Education Learning in an Age of Transformation, (2015); Barth, Matthias, Academic staff development as a catalyst for curriculum change towards education for sustainable development: An output perspective, Journal of Cleaner Production, 26, pp. 28-36, (2012); Barth, Matthias, Synthesising case-study research - ready for the next step?, Environmental Education Research, 18, 6, pp. 751-764, (2012); Comp A J Comp Int Educ, (2021); Boyd, Peter J., Becoming a university lecturer in teacher education: Expert school teachers reconstructing their pedagogy and identity, Professional Development in Education, 36, 1-2, pp. 9-24, (2010); Brandt, Jan Ole, Becoming a competent teacher in education for sustainable development: Learning outcomes and processes in teacher education, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 20, 4, pp. 630-653, (2019); Brundiers, Katja, Key competencies in sustainability in higher education—toward an agreed-upon reference framework, Sustainability Science, 16, 1, pp. 13-29, (2021); Bürgener, Lina, Sustainability competencies in teacher education: Making teacher education count in everyday school practice, Journal of Cleaner Production, 174, pp. 821-826, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132532259"

One of the most popular of these solutions is to add surplus components to the subsystems of a system (known as RRAP) and the reliability-redundancy allocation problem. In a subsystem, how these surplus components are used is of particular importance. How to use surplus components in the subsystem is known as. There are three general strategies for reliability issues known as active, stored, and mixed strategy. The main aim of the study is to create a new formula on the basis of the subsystems that use these two strategies. Model 4 provides a continuous limit of the Markov chain with continuous time. This new formula enables us to perform complex strategy calculations in a very short time and accurately. Finally the exact function obtained for mixed strategy Protective system ultra-fast gas turbine has been tested. Given the results, the new equation decreased the solution time besides the accurate estimation of the system’s reliability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Allocation Strategy; Assigning Reliability-redundancy; Markov Chain Model; Mixed Strategy; Reliability Optimization","","","","","Amiri, Ali Ahmad, Comparative analysis of economic aspects of concentrated solar power versus photovoltaic in afghanistan-case study: Kang district, nimruz, International Journal of Innovative Research and Scientific Studies, 4, 2, pp. 111-119, (2021); Abouei Ardakan, Mostafa, A novel strategy for redundant components in reliability--redundancy allocation problems, IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers), 48, 11, pp. 1043-1057, (2016); Abouei Ardakan, Mostafa, Reliability-redundancy allocation problem with cold-standby redundancy strategy, Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 42, pp. 107-118, (2014); Abouei Ardakan, Mostafa, Reliability optimization of series-parallel systems with mixed redundancy strategy in subsystems, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 130, pp. 132-139, (2014); Assadi, Abbas, Nonlinear static bending of single-crystalline circular nanoplates with cubic material anisotropy, Archive of Applied Mechanics, 90, 4, pp. 847-868, (2020); Bukhari, Syed Nisar Hussain, Decision tree based ensemble machine learning model for the prediction of Zika virus T-cell epitopes as potential vaccine candidates, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Busacca, P.

Firstly, GSCM has a positive and significant influence on the operational performance of businesses in Vietnam. Secondly, the resulting effect of implementing GSCM is better for enterprises with large scale and high export rates. This has reaffirmed the need to improve the overall supply chain management and green supply chain of this group of businesses.

Design/methodology/approach: A meta-analytic investigation of 32 studies was conducted to check hypotheses. Both uncorrected sample-size-weighted and corrected sample-size-weighted mean correlation coefficients were calculated. Meta-regression was used to assess moderation from EI and narcissism measures. Findings: The results indicated that the relationship between EI and narcissism varied, depending on how EI and narcissism were constructed and measured. Specifically, EI was positively related to grandiose narcissism (GN) and negatively related to vulnerable narcissism (VN). EI was also positively correlated with “composite measures” of narcissism when the measures focused on GN, and negatively correlated when the measures focused on VN. Furthermore, some EI and narcissism measures moderated the correlation between EI and narcissism. Originality/value: The current study enriches theory by synthesizing the literature to examine whether, and under which conditions, EI fosters or inhibits narcissism. By using the self-regulatory process of narcissism, carefully considering the multifaceted nature of narcissism and updating more data in the meta-analysis, this study contributes to explaining the inconsistency in the relationship between EI and narcissism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emotional Intelligence; Grandiose Narcissism; Meta-analysis; Narcissism; Organizational Behavior; Self-regulatory Process; Vulnerable Narcissism","","","","Funding: The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research of this article: This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.02-2020.05.","Ames, Daniel R., The NPI-16 as a short measure of narcissism, Journal of Research in Personality, 40, 4, pp. 440-450, (2006); Austin, Elizabeth J., Associations of the managing the emotions of others (MEOS) scale with personality, the Dark Triad and trait EI, Personality and Individual Differences, 65, pp. 8-13, (2014); Multi Health Systems, (1997); Begg, Colin B., Operating characteristics of a rank correlation test for publication bias, Biometrics, 50, 4, pp. 1088-1101, (1994); Brown, Ashley A., Perceived agency mediates the link between the narcissistic subtypes and self-esteem, Personality and Individual Differences, 90, pp. 124-129, (2016); Cǒté, Stéphane, Emotional Intelligence in Organizations, Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 1, pp. 459-488, (2014); Cragun, Ormonde Rhees, Making CEO Narcissism Research Great: A Review and Meta-Analysis of CEO Narcissism, Journal of Management, 46, 6, pp. 908-936, (2020); Derry, Kate Loren, Fearing Failure: Grandiose Narcissism, Vulnerable Narcissism, and Emotional Reactivity in Children, Child Development, 91, 3, pp. e581-e596, (2020); Duval, Sue J., Trim and fill: A simple funnel-plot-based method of testing and adjusting for publication bias in meta-analysis, Biometrics, 56, 2, pp. 455-463, (2000); Egger, Matthias, Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test, BMJ, 315, 7109, pp. 629-634, (1997)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","20408269","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125046540"

In addition, this study further reveals the diverse nature of university lecturers with regards to their tendencies to adopt active teaching methods using the segmentation technique of marketing. Design/methodology/approach: A structured survey was implemented with university lecturers in Hanoi (Vietnam), obtaining a sample of 218 respondents from six universities. Descriptive analysis was carried out to identify the extent of the adoption of these methods. In addition, cluster analysis and analysis of variance were computed to extract and define the segments of university lecturers. Findings: The findings show that the lecturers, on average, had a tendency to apply active teaching methods. However, the extent of the application of these methods differed among four clusters: “conservatives,” “liberals,” “junior conservatives” and “junior liberals.” In addition, it was found that the degree to which active methods were applied may have been affected by the lecturers' trust in and their empowerment of the students. The application of active methods may also have been influenced by various covert characteristics of the lecturers, including thinking styles (cognition-based) and emotional intelligence (affect-based). The lecturers' overt characteristics, such as age, education and experience, may also have affected their application of active methods, while biological sex seems not to have been a significant factor. Originality/value: The results of this study expand the literature by explaining the diversity of university lecturers from the perspective of the active teaching and learning methods. They also provide implications for the management of education reform based on the varied implementation of the said methods that has already taken place. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Methods; Affect-based Criteria; Cognition-based Criteria; Lecturer Segmentation; Vietnam's University","","","","","Admiraal, Wilfried F., Teachers in school-based technology innovations: A typology of their beliefs on teaching and technology, Computers and Education, 114, pp. 57-68, (2017); Angulo, Fernando, A market segmentation approach for higher education based on rational and emotional factors, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 20, 1, pp. 1-17, (2010); Bandura, Albert, Perceived Self-Efficacy in Cognitive Development and Functioning, Educational Psychologist, 28, 2, pp. 117-148, (1993); Baumann, Chris, The role of culture, competitiveness and economic performance in explaining academic performance: A global market analysis for international student segmentation, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 21, 2, pp. 181-201, (2011); Boyatzis, Richard E., From learning styles to learning skills: The executive skills profile, Journal of Managerial Psychology, 10, 5, pp. 3-17, (1995); Business Research Methods and Statistics Using Spss, (2008); Carless, David Robert, Factors in the implementation of task-based teaching in primary schools, System, 31, 4, pp. 485-500, (2003); Cheng, Yin Cheong, Education reform phenomenon: A typology of multiple dilemmas, pp. 85-109, (2020); Constantinides, Efthymios, Potential of the social media as instruments of higher education marketing: A segmentation study, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 21, 1, pp. 7-24, (2011); Cook-Sather, Alison, Authorizing Students' Perspectives: Toward Trust, Dialogue, and Change in Education, Educational Researcher, 31, 4, pp. 3-14, (2002)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","2515964X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136926013"

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire surveys were conducted to collect the opinions of 212 household representatives living in Hanoi City. The survey tools were tested and adjusted through an online survey with 191 responses. Multivariate probit and linear regression models were used to identify determinants of respondents’ choices of measures and their WTP. Findings: Respondents expressed their strong preferences for three measures for air quality improvements, including: (1) increase of green spaces; (2) use of less polluting fuels; (3) expansion of public transportation. The mean WTP for the implementation of those measures was estimated at about 148,000–282,000 Vietnamese dong, equivalent to 0.09–0.16% of household income. The respondents’ choices appear to be consistent with their characteristics and needs, such as financial affordability, time on roads and their perceived impacts of air pollution. The WTP estimates increase with perception of air pollution impacts, time on roads, education and income; but are lower for older people. Practical implication: Increase of green spaces can be the measure to which policy makers should pay more attention. The match-up of residents needs and well-informed plans will be an important key to success.

In addition, the positive effect of CSR practices on social sustainability performance (SSP) is examined. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of hypotheses between barriers, CSR practices and SSP is established. Using a survey questionnaire, empirical data are collected from 17 construction firms in Vietnam. PLS-SEM is used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that organizational and industrial barriers negatively affect CSR practices. This study also finds that education and training and government support could enable construction firms to reduce the impact of such barriers. Research limitations/implications: The data are collected in Vietnam; thereby the findings are only applicable in developing countries. Further research should also be conducted in other countries to improve the generalizability of the theoretical framework. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that construction firms could apply several strategies (e.g. providing their employees with CSR training and education; embedding CSR into their firm policy, mission and vision) to mitigate the impact of CSR barriers and, accordingly, ensure the success of adopting CSR practices.

Using a panel data set of more than 1000 Japanese listed firms from 2005 to 2014, we focus on firms that introduced female directors to their male-dominant boards for the first time and find that the first-introduced female directors are positively associated with a greater number of female officers and managers. The introduction of the first female director is also associated with better CSR performance. Our results are statistically significant and suggest that board gender diversity has an effect on promoting gender diversity at lower levels and CSR performance in listed firms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Gender Diversity; Corporate Governance; Csr; Female Directors; Japan","","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Yoko Shirasu, Mahnoor Sattar, and seminar participants at the 44th Conference of the Japan Finance Association, the 32nd Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics Annual Conference, and the 8th Annual International Conference on Emerging Challenges: Contemporary Issues in Innovation and Management, 2021 New Zealand Finance Meeting for their helpful suggestions and comments.

To overcome such challenges, a novel GTAW process has been developed for joining ultra-thin metal sheets for the first time. The novel welding torch with a novel orifice is the main discovered point of this process. In this paper, the novelties of the developed technology are clarified by comparing it with the conventional GTAW process. The results show that the novel GTAW process features much distinctiveness as compared to the conventional GTAW process: (i) the arc plasma column is more concentrated; (ii) the heat input is considerably reduced, but the temperature at the arc center is greatly increased; (iii) the metal evaporation and the metal vapor amount attached to the tungsten electrode surface are enormously reduced, and (iv) the corrosion of the tungsten electrode tip is vastly reduced. As a result, the novel GTAW process can successfully perform the butt weld of thin/ultra-thin metal sheets (up to 0.03 mm) with high quality and reliability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Butt Weld; Low Heat Input; Novel Gtaw Process; Novel Orifice; Ultra-thin Metal Sheet; Butt Welding; Corrosion; Joining; Orifices; Sheet Metal; Tungsten; Welding Electrodes; Butt Weld; Gtaw Process; Heat Input; Low Heat Inputs; Novel Gtaw Process; Novel Orifice; Thin Sheet; Tungsten Electrodes; Ultra-thin; Ultra-thin Metal Sheets; Welds","Butt welding; Corrosion; Joining; Orifices; Sheet metal; Tungsten; Welding electrodes; Butt weld; GTAW process; Heat input; Low heat inputs; Novel GTAW process; Novel orifice; Thin sheet; Tungsten electrodes; Ultra-thin; Ultra-thin metal sheets; Welds","","","This research is supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) in project code VINIF.2020.DA12.","Takeda, Yasunori, Fabrication of Ultra-Thin printed organic TFT CMOS logic circuits optimized for low-voltage wearable sensor applications, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Tisza, Miklós, Comparative study of the application of steels and aluminium in lightweight production of automotive parts, International Journal of Lightweight Materials and Manufacture, 1, 4, pp. 229-238, (2018); undefined; Abioye, T.

The properties of a CLSM mixture made from cement, fly ash, and waste water treatment sludge (WTS) were examined in this study. The CLSM mixtures were prepared using several water-to-binder (w/b) ratios (0.5, 0.65, and 0.8) and WTS weight ratios (0, 20, 40, and 80%). A solution of 5M NaOH was employed as a mixture accelerator. The influences of WTS addition on the characteristics of both fresh and hardened CLSM were examined. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and the change in minerals and microstructures of the CLSM samples were also investigated. The experimental results demonstrated that incorporating WTS into CLSM results in significant changes in fresh unit weight and mixture workability. The CLSM properties were found to be strongly affected by both the w/b ratio and accelerator dosage. Moreover, the TCLP test confirmed that WTS can be used as a safe by-product because the leached levels of heavy metals from raw WTS and resulting CLSM were significantly less than the permitted thresholds. Finally, the CLSM designed using a w/b ratio of 0.65, accelerator of 5%, and 40% WTS achieved the highest performance that meets current relevant Taipei City design regulations for excavatable backfilling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accelerator; Cement; Controlled Low-strength Material; Fly Ash; Waste Water Treatment Sludge; Water-to-binder Ratio; Acceleration; Heavy Metals; Leaching; Mixtures; Portland Cement; Sodium Hydroxide; Wastewater Treatment; Accelerator; Controlled Low Strength Materials; Filling Materials; Material Mixture; Ternary Mixtures; Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedures; Waste Water Treatment Sludge; Waste-water Treatment; Water Treatment Sludge; Water-to-binder Ratio; Fly Ash","Acceleration; Heavy metals; Leaching; Mixtures; Portland cement; Sodium hydroxide; Wastewater treatment; Accelerator; Controlled low strength materials; Filling materials; Material mixture; Ternary mixtures; Toxicity characteristics leaching procedures; Waste water treatment sludge; Waste-water treatment; Water treatment sludge; Water-to-binder ratio; Fly ash","","","Funding for this investigation was provided by the Taipei Water Department (grant no. 10358003F31 ) in Taiwan.","Achtemichuk, Sasha, The utilization of recycled concrete aggregate to produce controlled low-strength materials without using Portland cement, Cement and Concrete Composites, 31, 8, pp. 564-569, (2009); Controlled Low Strength Materials, (1999); Chang, Zhiyang, Valorization of sewage sludge in the fabrication of construction and building materials: A review, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 154, (2020); Chen, Zhen, Comparative studies on the effects of sewage sludge ash and fly ash on cement hydration and properties of cement mortars, Construction and Building Materials, 154, pp. 791-803, (2017); Chindaprasirt, Prinya, Comparative study on the characteristics of fly ash and bottom ash geopolymers, Waste Management, 29, 2, pp. 539-543, (2009); Deng, An, Geotechnical and leaching properties of flowable fill incorporating waste foundry sand, Waste Management, 28, 11, pp. 2161-2170, (2008); Manh Do, Tan, Development of a new cementless binder for controlled low strength material (CLSM) using entirely by-products, Construction and Building Materials, 206, pp. 576-589, (2019); Do, Tan Manh, Engineering properties of controlled low strength material (CLSM) incorporating red mud, International Journal of Geo-Engineering, 7, 1, (2016); Ebert, Benjamin A.R., Impact of electrodialytic remediation of MSWI fly ash on hydration and mechanical properties of blends with Portland cement, Construction and Building Materials, 309, (2021); Fang, Xiaoliang, Transforming waterworks sludge into controlled low-strength material: Bench-scale optimization and field test validation, Journal of Environmental Management, 232, pp. 254-263, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129162179"

However, an effective measure of spatiotemporal regularity for tensors is still lacking. This study proposes an entropy measure for tensors, tensor approximate entropy (TensorApEn), to evaluate the regularity or complexity within tensors. TensorApEn is calculated by examining the conditional probabilities of the inherent similarities in tensors. Experiments are performed on general tensors and sleep tensors, where general tensors are formatted from common time series, and sleep tensors from electroencephalographs (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG). Results demonstrate that TensorApEn has good consistency and discrimination abilities, and is statistically significant across six sleep stages (Wake, S1, S2, S3, S4, and REM) on 59481 sleep tensors from 61 subjects. In the sleep scoring task, compared to traditional entropy measures and existing works, TensorApEn shows higher classification accuracies of 96.45%, 91.87%, 85.43%, 83.76%, and 80.73% in 2- to 6-class classification modes, respectively, and the corresponding highest Kappa indices are 0.93, 0.88, 0.87, 0.83, and 0.82.

A coarse-grained sentiment analysis at the document level and a sentiment analysis at the sentence level can only judge an entire text comprehensively, whereas a fine-grained sentiment analysis distinguishes each concrete aspect of the text and makes separate judgments on the sentiment polarity. The word vector representation obtained by a recurrent neural network lacks a description of the distance relationship between the context words and aspect, and traditional models rarely consider the influence of the association between contextual sentences. In this paper, we propose an aspect-level sentiment analysis model with aspect-specific contextual location information. By designing two asymmetrical contextual position weight functions respectively, the model adjusts the weight of contextual words according to the positions of the aspect words in the sentences, and alleviates the interference of the difference in the number of words on both sides of the aspect words on the judgment of sentimental polarity. By utilizing single-sentence-level and multiple-sentence-level bidirectional GRU layers, model will extract the influence of the contextual association of each sentence in the document on the aspect sentiment polarity of individual sentences. In addition, we analyze the distribution properties of hard samples and design a novel loss function for the class imbalance problem in the field of sentiment analysis. For dataset 15Rest, the accuracy of our model is 4.27% higher than that of ASGCN, whereas the f1-score, which is more indicative of the classification performance on an imbalanced dataset, can be seen to be improved by 4.31% in comparison to the ASGCN. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis; Class Imbalance; Natural Language Processing; Classification (of Information); Recurrent Neural Networks; Aspect-level Sentiment Analyse; Class Imbalance; Coarse-grained; Context-word; Fine Grained; Position Information; Sentence Level; Sentiment Analysis; Vector Representations; Word Vectors","Classification (of information); Recurrent neural networks; Aspect-level sentiment analyse; Class imbalance; Coarse-grained; Context-word; Fine grained; Position information; Sentence level; Sentiment analysis; Vector representations; Word vectors","","","This study was supported by the National Key Technology R&D Program of China (No. 2020AAA0109300) and the Opening Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, China (AGK2019004).","Pang, Bo, Opinion mining and sentiment analysis, Computational Linguistics, 35, 2, pp. 311-312, (2009); Schouten, Kim, Survey on Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 28, 3, pp. 813-830, (2016); Majumder, Navonil, Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification with Multitask Learning, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 34, 3, pp. 38-43, (2019); Tang, Duyu, Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network, pp. 214-224, (2016); Tang, Jialong, Progressive self-supervised attention learning for aspect-level sentiment analysis, pp. 557-566, (2020); He, Ruidan, An unsupervised neural attention model for aspect extraction, 1, pp. 388-397, (2017); undefined, (2016); Statistical Language Models Based on Neural Networks, (2012); Mnih, Volodymyr, Recurrent models of visual attention, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 3, January, pp. 2204-2212, (2014); Wang, Xiaodi, A novel network with multiple attention mechanisms for aspect-level sentiment analysis, Knowledge-Based Systems, 227, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125861685"

This paper investigates the effects of NTMs on Vietnamese exports. It considers NTMs imposed by importing countries and by the Vietnamese government itself. We find that for importing countries' NTMs the technical measures have a positive effect on Vietnamese exports, especially intermediate goods. Final products seem to be the target of non-technical measures used by importing countries. With regard to Vietnam's export-related NTMs, technical measures seem to be effective in increasing Vietnam's exports of final products to importing countries with a level of per capita income below US$11,462. For those importing country markets, the positive marginal effect of Vietnam's export-related technical measures on exports of final products is higher in poorer countries. On the other hand, the non-technical categories tend to negatively affect Vietnamese exports of intermediate goods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We thank Kiyotaka Sato, Nagendra Shrestha, Minako Fujio, and Teru Nishikawa for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this work.

Thus, a further understanding of consumer behaviour and loyalty towards such food is essential for food retailers. This study aims at exploring segments of consumer loyalty and its influential factors towards safe food brands in the country. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 250 consumers buying safe food in Hanoi city in February 2019, two-step cluster and multinomial logistic regression analyses were applied. Findings: The results show that four segments of brand loyalty were formed from the interaction between attitudinal and behavioural loyalty as the framework of Dick and Basu (1994), namely, true loyalty, spurious loyalty, latent loyalty and disloyalty. Notably, over 60% of the consumers were in latent loyalty and spurious loyalty, indicating variety-seeking behaviour, multi-brand loyalty or low recognition of the brand. Consumer satisfaction was the most vital motivating consumers to higher loyalty levels. Additionally, brand trust and brand familiarity played significant roles in developing true brand loyalty. An attractive selling store and friendly staff were also important in enhancing brand loyalty. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to elicit consumer loyalty and identify factors driving the loyalty towards brands of safe food in a developing country like Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand Loyalty; Brands; Consumer Loyalty; Safe Food; Safe Vegetables; Vietnam","","","","This study was partially funded by the QR programme, Kyushu University, Japan.

This study aims to identify the challenges faced by hotel managers in adopting MTs in their industry, such that the authors may determine the strategic positions for adopting and managing MTs and build a frame of reference for hotel management practices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a series of focus group interviews (FGIs) with the managers and executives of luxury hotels. FGIs were conducted in groups in a semi-structured format, asking questions about MT adoption in their hotels and the challenges they faced. The FGI transcripts were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Findings: Open and axial coding of FGI scripts revealed 15 underlying categories of challenges in adopting MTs in hotels. Subsequent selective coding revealed two underlying dimensions: viability-fit. With these two underlying dimensions, a strategic model for MT adoption is developed. This model identifies four MT adoption strategies in hotels: lookers, experimenters, explorers and leaders. Originality/value: The model developed and presented herein may help analyze a hotel’s strategic positioning in adopting MT’s.

HUSPM algorithms discover useful information from data. However, looking at the dark side, the sensitive patterns can also be disclosed by the competitors, who use a HUSPM algorithm on the leaked data. Therefore, high-utility sequential pattern hiding (HUSPH) is used to protect the privacy information from HUSPM algorithms. This paper proposes three algorithms named High Utility Sequential Pattern Hiding Using Pure Array Structure (USHPA), High Utility Sequential Pattern Hiding Using Parallel Strategy (USHP), and High Utility Sequential Pattern Hiding Using Random Distribution Strategy (USHR) for hiding high-utility sequential patterns on quantitative sequence datasets. These algorithms use a proposed data structure named Pattern Utility Set for Hiding (PUSH) to speed up the hiding process. We also introduce a metric called Privacy Factor to evaluate the quality of hiding results. The comparative experiments were conducted on real datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of runtime, memory consumption, scalability, missing cost, and privacy factor. Results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently sanitize the input datasets, and they outperform the compared algorithms for all metrics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High-utility Sequential Pattern Hiding; High-utility Sequential Pattern Mining; Parallel Hiding; Privacy Preserving Utility Mining; Data Mining; Privacy-preserving Techniques; High-utility Sequential Pattern Hiding; High-utility Sequential Pattern Mining; Multi-core Parallels; Parallel Hiding; Privacy Preserving; Privacy Preserving Utility Mining; Sequential Pattern Mining Algorithm; Sequential Patterns; Sequential-pattern Mining; Utility Mining; Quality Control","Data mining; Privacy-preserving techniques; High-utility sequential pattern hiding; High-utility sequential pattern mining; Multi-core parallels; Parallel hiding; Privacy preserving; Privacy preserving utility mining; Sequential pattern mining algorithm; Sequential patterns; Sequential-pattern mining; Utility mining; Quality control","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 102.05-2018.307 .","Tedersoo, Leho, Data sharing practices and data availability upon request differ across scientific disciplines, Scientific Data, 8, 1, (2021); Yeh, Jiehshan, HHUIF and MSICF: Novel algorithms for privacy preserving utility mining, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 7, pp. 4779-4786, (2010); Fung, Benjamin C.M., Privacy-preserving data publishing: A survey of recent developments, ACM Computing Surveys, 42, 4, (2010); Evfimievski, Alexandre V., Privacy preserving mining of association rules, Information Systems, 29, 4, pp. 343-364, (2004); Gan, Wensheng Sheng, Privacy Preserving Utility Mining: A Survey, pp. 2617-2626, (2018); Dinh, Tai Tai, A Survey of Privacy Preserving Utility Mining, Studies in Big Data, 51, pp. 207-232, (2019); Dinh, Tai Tai, A novel approach for hiding high utility sequential patterns, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 03-04-December-2015, pp. 121-128, (2015); Quang, Minh Nguyen, MHHUSP: An integrated algorithm for mining and Hiding High Utility Sequential Patterns, pp. 13-18, (2016); Quang, Minh Nguyen, An approach to decrease execution time and difference for hiding high utility sequential patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9978 LNAI, pp. 435-446, (2016); Le, Bac Hoai, An efficient algorithm for Hiding High Utility Sequential Patterns, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 95, pp. 77-92, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121496624"

In this paper, we mainly explore a novel framework of sequential three-way decision for the fusion of mixed data from the subjective and objective dynamic perspectives. The former focuses on the decision maker's dynamic behavior without considering the time-evolving data, and the latter emphasizes on dealing with dynamic mixed data over time by multi-stage decision-making. We firstly utilize four T-norm operators and kernel-based similarity relations to integrate different types of dynamic data. Then the subjective and objective models of sequential three-way decision are investigated based on decision thresholds, attribute importance and cost reduction. Finally, the comparative experiments are reported to verify that our proposed models can achieve the lower decision cost and the acceptable accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Fusion; Mixed Data; Sequential Three-way Decision; Subjective–objective; Three-way Decision; Cost Reduction; Coarse To Fine; Data Driven; Decision Makers; Dynamic Fusion; Mixed Data; Multi-views; Multilevels; Sequential Three-way Decision; Subjective–objective; Three-way Decision; Decision Making","Cost reduction; Coarse to fine; Data driven; Decision makers; Dynamic fusion; Mixed data; Multi-views; Multilevels; Sequential three-way decision; Subjective–objective; Three-way decision; Decision making","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61773324 , 61876157 , 61976182 ), the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 20YJC630191 ), the Fintech Innovation Center of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, China , and the Financial Intelligence & Financial Engineering Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, China .","Yao, Yiyu Y., Three-way granular computing, rough sets, and formal concept analysis, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 116, pp. 106-125, (2020); Yao, Yiyu Y., The geometry of three-way decision, Applied Intelligence, 51, 9, pp. 6298-6325, (2021); Yao, Yiyu Y., Three-Way Decisions and Cognitive Computing, Cognitive Computation, 8, 4, pp. 543-554, (2016); Liu, Dun, Three-way decisions: beyond rough sets and granular computing, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 11, 5, pp. 989-1002, (2020); Yao, Yiyu Y., Three-way decision and granular computing, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 103, pp. 107-123, (2018); Li, Yuefeng, Enhancing Binary Classification by Modeling Uncertain Boundary in Three-Way Decisions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 29, 7, pp. 1438-1451, (2017); Yu, Hong, An active three-way clustering method via low-rank matrices for multi-view data, Information Sciences, 507, pp. 823-839, (2020); Ma, Xi'ao, Three-way decision perspectives on class-specific attribute reducts, Information Sciences, 450, pp. 227-245, (2018); Liu, Dun, A matrix factorization based dynamic granularity recommendation with three-way decisions, Knowledge-Based Systems, 191, (2020); Li, Jinhai, Three-way cognitive concept learning via multi-granularity, Information Sciences, 378, pp. 244-263, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121121839"

Efficient water management is required to suppress the emission of methane from paddy fields, which is the major source of methane in agriculture. In addition, water saving is possible through improved water management as water resources are becoming scarce due to climate change and extreme weather. According to the authors, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is a promising option for reducing methane emissions from paddy rice and at the same time improving water-use efficiency. This is possible with the alteration in redox state of soil through AWD. Although its methane-reducing and water-saving effects were demonstrated by previous studies, AWD is not widely practiced in rice growing regions in Asia due to other associated challenges. To implement and realize the benefits of AWD at the systemic level, it is necessary to manage the irrigation system collectively by farmers. The chapter discusses in detail the practical AWD implementation through ‘block wise distribution of water’ managed by farmers themselves in the paddy district of the Red River Delta area in Vietnam. In addition, the institutional and technical issues supporting organizational environmental-friendly agricultural water management that will be needed to upscale AWD are discussed in the chapter. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abbott, Michael B., An introduction to the European Hydrological System - Systeme Hydrologique Europeen, ""SHE"", 1: History and philosophy of a physically-based, distributed modelling system, Journal of Hydrology, 87, 1-2, pp. 45-59, (1986); Abbott, Michael B., An introduction to the European Hydrological System - Systeme Hydrologique Europeen, ""SHE"", 2: Structure of a physically-based, distributed modelling system, Journal of Hydrology, 87, 1-2, pp. 61-77, (1986); Amin, M.G.

This paper presents the results of an empirical study investigating the moderating roles of information technology link and information sharing on the relationship between supplier development, knowledge absorption from customers, and supply chain performance. Statistical techniques such as measurement test, correlation analysis, and regression analysis are applied to analyze the data collected during the Round 4 of the High Performance Manufacturing (HPM) Project. The data sample includes 304 manufacturing plants operating in 13 countries including Brazil, China, Finland, German, Italy, Israel, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Analytical results indicate that a supply chain would perform better when focal firms invest their effort in supplier development and knowledge absorption activities and develop a strong link with suppliers and customers through information technology systems. Information technology links with suppliers and customers have significant moderating roles in strengthening the relationship between supplier development, knowledge absorption from customers, and supply chain performance. Moreover, information sharing exchange with suppliers were found to make the association between supplier development and supply chain performance becomes more pronounced. The empirical results contribute to the existing literature of information sharing and supply chain coordination in supply chain management. In addition, this study provides several practical implications, such that information technology linkage and information sharing activities should be considered as the platforms for organizations to interact with different supply chain partners for achieving high supply chain performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information Sharing; Information Technology Link; Knowledge Absorption; Supplier Development; Supply Chain Performance","","","","","Baihaqi, Imam, The impact of information sharing in supply chains on organisational performance: An empirical study, Production Planning and Control, 24, 8-9, pp. 743-758, (2013); Braojos, Jessica, Impact of IT integration on the firm's knowledge absorption and desorption, Information and Management, 57, 7, (2020); Carr, Amelia S., Communication methods, information sharing, supplier development and performance: An empirical study of their relationships, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 27, 4, pp. 346-370, (2007); Chau, Ka Yin, Investigation of critical success factors for improving supply chain quality management in manufacturing, Enterprise Information Systems, 15, 10, pp. 1418-1437, (2021); Chen, Liang, A knowledge management perspective of supplier development: Evidence from supply chain scholars and consultants, Knowledge and Process Management, 25, 4, pp. 247-257, (2018); Fawcett, Stanley E., Information sharing and supply chain performance: The role of connectivity and willingness, Supply Chain Management, 12, 5, pp. 358-368, (2007); Flynn, Barbara B., On Theory in Supply Chain Uncertainty and its Implications for Supply Chain Integration, Journal of Supply Chain Management, 52, 3, pp. 3-27, (2016); Gassmann, Oliver, Negative side effects of customer integration, International Journal of Technology Management, 50, 1, pp. 43-63, (2010); Glavee-Geo, Richard, Does supplier development lead to supplier satisfaction and relationship continuation?, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, 3, (2019); MIS Quarterly, (2012)","","Technical University of Liberec","","","","","","12123609","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144190294"

Serotypes 1/2b were dominant, and internalin genes (inlA, inlC, and inlJ) were found in all the L. monocytogenes isolates. Most of the isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, oxacillin, and fosfomycin. Genotyping of L. monocytogenes by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed three clusters of the isolates specific to the facilities to some extent. This study suggests a high risk of L. monocytogenes contamination from wash water to fish.

Afterwards, a comparative model containing the single effects of risks on supply chain performance was developed as a basis for comparison with the theoretical model. The impacts of each risk on supply chain performance were demonstrated in both models. When the parameters of the theoretical model are greater than those in the competitive model, the resonant effect mechanism is proven and vice versa. Findings - 63% variance of supply chain performance was explained by our risk model, which includes positive and negative resonant effects between risks. It is a remarkable rate compared with the comparative model and previous studies. Whilst a positive relationship (α ≥ 0) increases the effect of the impacted risk on the output, a negative relationship (α ≤ 0) decreases this effect, bringing benefits for companies which “see” these opportunities. Thus, practitioners should treat risk as an opportunity rather than a threat. Research limitations/implications - A positive optimal resonant model is necessary to maximize the impact of risks on supply chain performance. Hence, companies can predict the worst-case scenario when six risks occur simultaneously. However, companies can devise mitigating techniques if a negative optimal resonant model is detected. Although risks can not be eliminated, their impact is likely to be abated by using a new paradigm. Originality/value - The data used in this research is from a large-scale survey supported by Japanese Government to promote ASEAN sustainable socio-economic development. This dataset collected during the Covid-19 pandemic to validate our models is an interesting and topical point of this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Risk Management; Supply Chain Management; Supply Chain Performance; Supply Chain Risk Management; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Environmental Impact; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Supply Chain Management; Comparative Modeling; Design/methodology/approach; Reliability And Validity; Resonant Effect; Risks Management; Supply Chain Performance; Supply Chain Risk Management; Supply-chain Risks; Theoretical Modeling; Risk Management","Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Supply chain management; Comparative modeling; Design/methodology/approach; Reliability and validity; Resonant effect; Risks management; Supply chain performance; Supply chain risk management; Supply-chain risks; Theoretical modeling; Risk management","","","Funding text 1: ?Thisworkwassupported(1)byJapaneseGovernmentthroughtheprojectof“AnEmpiricalStudyonServices ?

Design/methodology/approach – A thorough review of historical developments and existing integration trends among Industries 4.0, quality, and supply chain approaches is conducted. This work establishes a knowledge base on research topics, issues of integration, and synergies concentrating on thedeeper integration with supply chain operations. Findings – Not only does this article introduce the term SCQM4.0 and propose a definition for it, but it also contributes a novel conceptual SCQM4.0 framework. Assessing the gaps, opportunities, and benefits identified in the literature, the conceptual SCQM4.0 framework builds on the high potential of the SCQM4.0 constructs to achieve successful governance and implementation. Research limitations/implications – Striving towards a successful SCQM4.0 implementation, the proposed SCQM4.0 framework will be a ""road map"" for businesses to develop fully and actively in supply chain operations, bringing quality products and services for the company. Industry practitioners are encouraged to perform gap analysis and direct the implementation of the strategy to establishing an excellent SCQM4.0. Originality/value – This is one of the pioneering studies that integrate all three concepts (Industrie 4.0, Quality Management, and Supply Chain Management), connecting the link, and discovering more synergies to support the future development of more holistic management models. SCQM4.0 is expected to expand on the strengths, and synergies, and establish relationships between technologies 4.0, quality, and supply chain, contributing to a pioneering and quality supply chain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disruptive Technologies; Industries 4.0; Quality Management; Supply Chain Management; Industry 4.0; Integration; Knowledge Based Systems; Quality Management; Conceptual Frameworks; Design/methodology/approach; Disruptive Technology; High Potential; Historical Development; Quality Supply; Research Topics; Supply Chain Operation; Supply Chain Quality Management; Systematic Literature Review; Supply Chain Management","Industry 4.0; Integration; Knowledge based systems; Quality management; Conceptual frameworks; Design/methodology/approach; Disruptive technology; High potential; Historical development; Quality supply; Research topics; Supply chain operation; Supply chain quality management; Systematic literature review; Supply chain management","","","This work was supported (1) by Japanese Government through the project of “An Empirical Study on Services Value Chain based on the Experiential and Credibility Values” (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) No.25240050), (2) by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through AUN/SEED-Net Project, No. 022674.242.2015/JICA-AC; and (3) by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI, No. JP18J11566.","Ajam, Maher, Augmented process model for e-tendering: Towards integrating object models with document management systems, Automation in Construction, 19, 6, pp. 762-778, (2010); Alfian, Ganjar, Real-time monitoring system using smartphone-based sensors and NoSQL database for perishable supply chain, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 11, (2017); Androulaki, Elli, Hyperledger Fabric: A Distributed Operating System for Permissioned Blockchains, 2018-January, (2018); Ardito, Lorenzo, Towards Industry 4.0: Mapping digital technologies for supply chain management-marketing integration, Business Process Management Journal, 25, 2, pp. 323-346, (2019); Aung, Myo Min, Traceability in a food supply chain: Safety and quality perspectives, Food Control, 39, 1, pp. 172-184, (2014); Azambuja, Marcelo M.B., Leveraging building information models to support supply chain decisions in construction projects, pp. 747-756, (2012); Baker, Peter, The design and operation of distribution centres within agile supply chains, International Journal of Production Economics, 111, 1, pp. 27-41, (2008); Barata, João, Mobile supply chain management in the Industry 4.0 era: An annotated bibliography and guide for future research, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 31, 1, pp. 173-192, (2018); Barnett-Page, Elaine, Methods for the synthesis of qualitative research: A critical review, BMC Medical Research Methodology, 9, 1, (2009); Barreto, Luís, Industry 4.0 implications in logistics: an overview, Procedia Manufacturing, 13, pp. 1245-1252, (2017)","Sampaio, P.; Domingues, P.; Costa, A.; Casadesus, M.; Marimon, F.; Pires, A.R.; Saraiva, P.","Universidade do Minho","","5th International Conference on Quality Engineering and Management: A Better World with Quality!

High-speed rail (HSR) has been mentioned recently and is expected as the best and most modern transport option in long-distance trips in Vietnam. However, research studies have paid scant regard to how HSR’s attributes may affect potential users, and therefore the motivations and barriers to adopting HSR are still unknown. Objectives: This study aimed at examining motivations and barriers to take-up HSR for considering customers’ preference on the proper attributes and levels of HSR. Method: This study drew on a nationwide survey and conjoint analysis to investigate customers’ behaviour. Results: In Vietnam’s context, HSR ticket was found to be the principal barrier to adoption, whereas the speed of HSR was identified as the least important behavioural driver amongst potential HSR users. The results show that HSR design and planning should provide a combination of minimum check-in and waiting time, a 20-min frequency, average speed of 250 km/h, all add-on services and facilities, ticketing of approximately VND 500-700 thousand per 300-500 km and nearby all-day parking. Conclusion: This investigation has demonstrated the value of conjoint analysis to compare a wide range of attributes associated with consumers’ decision to use HSR. The findings indicate that in countries such as Vietnam, in particular, where train usage is low, policymakers and transportation agencies seeking to boost the use of HSR must take attributes other than fare into consideration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attributes; Check-in And Waiting Time; Conjoint Analysis; High-speed Rail; Levels; Ticket Fare","","","","","Álvarez-SanJaime, Óscar, A model of internal and external competition in a High Speed Rail line, Economics of Transportation, 4, 3, pp. 178-187, (2015); Behrens, Christiaan, Intermodal competition in the London-Paris passenger market: High-Speed Rail and air transport, Journal of Urban Economics, 71, 3, pp. 278-288, (2012); Borhan, Muhamad Nazri Bin, Extending the theory of planned behaviour to predict the intention to take the new high-speed rail for intercity travel in Libya: Assessment of the influence of novelty seeking, trust and external influence, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 130, pp. 373-384, (2019); Borsati, Mattia, On the modal shift from motorway to high-speed rail: evidence from Italy, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 137, pp. 145-164, (2020); Campa, Juan Luis, High speed rail effects on tourism: Spanish empirical evidence derived from China's modelling experience, Journal of Transport Geography, 57, pp. 44-54, (2016); Asrdlf 2012 Conference Special Session on High Speed Rail Tourism and Territories, (2012); Passengers Choice Between High Speed Train and Air Transport, (2022); Gehrt, Kenneth C., Understanding preference for high-speed rail service: A consumer logistics perspective, Innovative Marketing, 3, 4, pp. 32-41, (2007); Decision 318 Qd Ttg on Approving the Strategy for Developing Transportation Service to 2020 Oriented to 2030, (2014); Journal of Consumer Research, (1978)","","AOSIS (pty) Ltd","","","","","","23108789; 19955235","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136807123"

An analysis of tourism policy and governance in Vietnam cannot set aside the evolution of the Marxist political economic doctrine regulating the socio-economic system of the country since 1975. The transition from the central plan to the market-driven economy has been reflected in tourism policy making and implementation. Owing to its high international integration, its exceptional vulnerability to changes in global trends while being well connected to domestic consumption and mobilization of resources for post-war development, tourism mirrors the notion of a transitional economy better than any other sector. Current trends towards environmental and cultural protection also clearly imprint on the policy of tourism development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Bähre, Heike, Privatisation during market economy transformation as a motor of development, pp. 33-58, (2006); Bianchi, Raoul V., The political economy of tourism development: A critical review, Annals of Tourism Research, 70, pp. 88-102, (2018); Bramwell, Bill, Governance, the state and sustainable tourism: A political economy approach, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 19, 4-5, pp. 459-477, (2011); Tourism and Development in Southeast Asia, (2020); Austrian Journal of South East Asian Studies, (2011); Burns, Peter M., Tourism and politics: Global frameworks and local realities, pp. 1-409, (2006); Cbre Hotels Insights Implications of Covid 19 on the Vietnam Hospitality Market, (2020); Pacific Tourism Review, (1997); Cooper, Malcolm J.M., Tourism in Vietnam: Doi Moi and the realities of tourism in the 1990s, pp. 167-177, (2012); Dredge, Dianne, Policy networks and the local organisation of tourism, Tourism Management, 27, 2, pp. 269-280, (2006)","","CABI International","","","","","","","9781789242782; 9781789242799","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129921937"

Textile strain sensors are smart textiles products in which the sensor’s resistance changes with applied strain. This study consists in the development of a textile strain sensor and its application on a Multifunctional Intelligent Elbow Brace (MIEB). The hand-knitted sensor was developed using knitting needles. The material used for this sensor was conductive yarn and lycra. The sensor developed was subjected to a stretch recovery test using a universal testing machine,, and the electrical resistance was measured using an electrical multimeter. The sensor developed has good sensing ability against cyclic loading and unloading at a 5%, 20%, 35% strain level. After testing, the sensor was stitched on an elbow brace to develop an MIEB. This study involved the best economical method for measuring the bowling angle of the player using this MIEB without any need for a biomechanical test, which is very expensive. This MIEB can also be used for rehabilitation purposes and for monitoring joint movement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bowling Action; Conductive Yarn; Elbow Brace; Hand-knitted Structure; Polyester/silver Blend; Textile Strain Sensor; Blending; Smart Textiles; Testing; Unloading; Wool; Bowling Action; Conductive Yarns; Elbow Brace; Hand-knitted Structure; Knitted Structures; Mechanical; Polyester/silver Blend; Strain Sensors; Textile Strain Sensor; Textile Structures; Yarn; Mixing; Needles; Resistance; Textiles","Blending; Smart textiles; Testing; Unloading; Wool; Bowling action; Conductive yarns; Elbow brace; Hand-knitted structure; Knitted structures; Mechanical; Polyester/silver blend; Strain sensors; Textile strain sensor; Textile structures; Yarn; Mixing; Needles; Resistance; Textiles","","","The authors would like to thank the National Textile University, Pakistan, and Shinshu University, Japan, for providing materials and characterisations for the above research project.","Justham, Laura M., Quantification and characterization of cricket bowling technique for the development of the parameters required for a novel training system for cricket, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology, 222, 2, pp. 61-76, (2008); Icc Regulations for the Review of Bowlers Reported with Suspected Illegal Bowling Actions, (2010); Sanders, Liam, Passive range of motion of the hips and shoulders and their relationship with ball spin rate in elite finger spin bowlers, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 22, 10, pp. 1146-1150, (2019); Ferdinands, René Edouard D., An evaluation of biomechanical measures of bowling action legality in cricket, Sports Biomechanics, 6, 3, pp. 315-333, (2007); Waqar, Sania, Piezoelectric energy harvesting from intelligent textiles, pp. 173-197, (2015); Mitchell, Edmond, Breathing feedback system with wearable textile sensors, pp. 56-61, (2010); Huang, Chingtang, A wearable textile for monitoring respiration, using a yarn-based sensor, Proceedings - International Symposium on Wearable Computers, ISWC, pp. 141-142, (2006); Li, Xiao, Stretchable and highly sensitive graphene-on-polymer strain sensors, Scientific Reports, 2, (2012); Guo, Li, Design of a garment-based sensing system for breathing monitoring, Textile Research Journal, 83, 5, pp. 499-509, (2013); Tangsirinaruenart, Orathai, A novel textile stitch-based strain sensor for wearable end users, Materials, 12, 9, (2019)","","Lukasiewicz Research Network - Institute of Biopolymers and Chemical Fibres","","","","","","12303666; 23007354","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125875039"

However, there is a limitation in understanding the consumers’ attitudes toward foods derived from this novel technology. Especially, the lack of knowledge and confusion in differentiating with genetically modified (GM) products could potentially restrict further development of genome-edited (GE) foods. Therefore, a survey of 407 Vietnamese consumers was conducted to analyze the implicit and explicit attitudes toward GE foods compared to GM foods under different information treatments. The implicit association test (IAT) was used for implicit evaluation, and semantic differential scales were used for explicit evaluation. As our important results, under the context of condensed information, the implicit measure shows a high correlation between attitudes toward GE and GM foods. This result is one of the initial pieces of evidence that has been shown about the relationship among consumers’ attitudes toward GE and GM foods. And as our result has been pointed out that providing in-depth information help to reduce the correlation between attitudes toward GE and GM foods. This evidence is important to suggest effective risk-benefits communication to help reduce negative attitudes toward GE food and increase consumers’ acceptance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Attitudes; Crispr/cas9; Genetically Modified Foods; Genome-edited Foods; Implicit Association Test","","","","","Aldemita, Rhodora R., Trends in global approvals of biotech crops (1992-2014), GM Crops and Food, 6, 3, pp. 150-166, (2015); Ciencia Y Tecnologia, (2020); Gatica-Arias, Andrés M., Consumer attitudes toward food crops developed by CRISPR/Cas9 in Costa Rica, Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, 139, 2, pp. 417-427, (2019); Armitage, Christopher J., Efficacy of the theory of planned behaviour: A meta-analytic review, British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, 4, pp. 471-499, (2001); Ayres, Karen M., Do implicit measures of attitudes incrementally predict snacking behaviour over explicit affect-related measures?, Appetite, 58, 3, pp. 835-841, (2012); A Comparative Investigation of Seven Implicit Measures of Social Cognition, (2012); Baum, Chad M., Information, attitudes, and consumer evaluations of cultivated meat, Food Quality and Preference, 92, (2021); Bekker, Gerben A., Explicit and implicit attitude toward an emerging food technology: The case of cultured meat, Appetite, 108, pp. 245-254, (2017); Stevens Handbook of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, (2018); APA Handbook of Personality and Social Psychology, (2015)","","Routledge","","","","","","15404102; 10454446","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125774425"

However, minimizing both the variance and bias of the estimate is a challenge due to the trade-off between the two. In many countries, tourism accommodation statistics, which popularly developed with the unbiased linear estimator, are less accurate. This study recommends an integration of bootstrap and regression to overcome the challenge. An unbiased linear estimator is used as a benchmark to investigate the integration method’s effectiveness. With realistic accommodation data in Japan, we found that the integration method yields more than two times more accurate results than the unbiased linear estimator.

Studying COVID-19 fear with stock market volatility is crucial for planning adequate portfolio diversification in international financial markets. The study used AR (1)–GARCH (1,1) to measure stock market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 fear is the ultimate cause driving public attention and stock market volatility. The results demonstrate that stock market performance and GDP growth decreased significantly through average increases during the pandemic. Further, with a 1% increase in COVID-19 cases, the stock return and GDP decreased by 0.8%, 0.56%, respectively. However, GDP growth demonstrated a slight movement with stock exchange. Moreover, public attention to the attitude of buying or selling was highly dependent on the COVID-19 pandemic reported cases index, death index, and global fear index.

In this study, we construct a small open economy model with financial frictions to generate the countercyclical movement in credit standards. Our analysis demonstrates that countercyclical fluctuations in credit standards work as an amplifier of shocks to the economy. In particular, the existence of endogenous credit standards increases output volatility by 21%. We also suggest three alternative tools for policymakers to dampen the effects of endogenous credit standards on macroeconomic volatility. First, the introduction of credit growth to the monetary policy succeeds in counteracting the fluctuation of lending, and thus decreasing the additional volatility considerably. Second, the exchange rate augmented monetary policy, if well-constructed, is considered an efficient tool to eliminate most of the additional fluctuations caused by deep habits in the banking sector. Finally, the introduction of the foreign interest augmented policy also proves successful in dampening the effect of endogenous movements in lending standards. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aggregate Fluctuations; Collateral Requirements; Credit Standards; Deep Habits; Dsge Modeling; Monetary Policy; Small Open Economy","","","","","Dynare Reference Manual Version 4, (2011); Afrin, Sadia, Does oligopolistic banking friction amplify small open economy's business cycles?

It draws on computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to computationally model, track, and classify human emotions and affective states. While the US once dominated the field in terms of research and citation from 1995–2015, China is now emerging as a global contender in research output, claiming second place for the most cited country from 2016–2020. This article maps the rhizomatic growth and development of scientific publications devoted to emotion-sensing AI technologies. It employs a bibliometric analysis that identifies major national contributors and international alliances in the field over the past 25 years. Contrary to the ongoing political rhetoric of a new Cold War, we argue that there are in fact vibrant AI research alliances and ongoing collaborations between the West and China, especially with the US, despite competing interests and ethical concerns. Our observations of historical data indicate two major collaborative networks: the “US/Asia-Pacific cluster” consisting of the US, China, Singapore, Japan and the “European” cluster of Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Our analysis also uncovers a major shift in the focus of affective computing research away from diagnosis and detection of mental illnesses to more commercially viable applications in smart city design.

In addition to structural changes, the time-series data are usually available only for a short number of periods, and predictors are available in different lengths and frequencies. Dynamic model averaging (DMA), by allowing the forecasting model to change dynamically over time, permits the use of predictors with different lengths and frequencies for the purpose of forecasting in a rapidly changing economy. This study uses DMA to forecast inflation and growth in Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Ghana. We compare its forecasting performance with a wide range of other time-series methods. We find that the size and composition of the optimal predictor set changed, indicating changes in the economic relationships over time.

Subsequently, the study formulates a model of ceiling price under the framework of simple two-route network by integrating the nature of travelers' mode choice with the interaction between stakeholders through the Nash equilibrium as well as a risk-mitigation approach in the ceiling price decision-making process. The proposed model has unique characteristics that allow the government to protect social welfare while still providing opportunities for private investors to achieve their optimal toll rates. It also provides room to the government for negotiating with private investors while taking into account travelers' benefits and risk identification. The model is applied to a case study in Hanoi, Vietnam; and successfully showed its applicability with empirical evidences.

As expected, the empirical evidence highlights the asymmetric behaviors of green bonds in response to diverse groups of commodities. Further, the hedging and diversification benefit of including green bonds to commodity portfolio is revealed. Defined by the uncorrelation or negative correlation with commodities in the periods of high volatility, we found the strongest hedging benefit of green bonds against the fluctuation of natural gas, some industrial metals, and agricultural commodities. While these underlying features are persistent in the long run, it is recommended to utilize the use of green bonds in the longer term (22 days) for higher portfolio performance rather than the short term (1 to 5 days). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodities; Cross-quantilogram; Diversification; Green Bonds","","","","Muhammad Abubakr Naeem gratefully acknowledges the support of Science Foundation Ireland under grant number 16/SPP/3347.

This study identified 10 constraints on implementing good management practices designed to improve the health and productivity of pig production, ensure the health of workers, reduce environmental pollution and allow customers to trace the origins of their products, collectively known as Good Animal Husbandry Practices. Low output price and lack of capital were identified as the key constraints faced by 42.8% and 28.3% of farmers, respectively. Furthermore, specialized production was found to mitigate these two constraints in terms of income contribution, whereas access to credit was found to exacerbate them. Lack of knowledge was the only constraint perceived to be more severe by non-VietGAHP farmers than by their VietGAHP counterparts. Based on the above results for both VietGAHP and non-VietGAHP farmers, these constraints need to be addressed by improving financial situations through formal credit and focusing on specialized pig-producing households.

The structure of ma-funori and fukuro-funori extracted from Gloiopeltis tenax and Gloiopeltis furcata, respectively, was characterized through FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. The assignment of signals for ma-funori showed that structure of ma-funori was relatively regular with repeating unit (1,3)-β-D-galactopyranose 6-sulfated linking to (1,4)-3,6-anhydro-α-L-galactopyranose. In contrast, the structure of fukuro-funori was complex with substitute groups such as pyruvate acetal, sulfate ester and methyl ether groups interspersing in polysaccharide chain. The physico-chemical properties of two kinds of funori which are important to restoration and conservation of artistic heritage were characterized. The solubility of fukuro-funori in water was higher than that of ma-funori. The wettability of fukuro-funori solution was better than that of ma-funori solution, whereas ma-funori solution was higher in viscosity than fukuro-funori.

Although industrial activity is rapidly expanding, production practices to increase material circularity and reduce environmental impact have yet to see sufficient progress. This article analyses the environmental benefits of implementing a regionally based co-processing scheme between the iron-steel and cement industries of three emergent South-East Asian economies: Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Vietnam, already ranked as the 8th largest cement producer, can be a crucial contributor to a more symbiotic exchange of wastes with regional neighbours. A plan to increase the co-processed iron/steel slag at cement facilities (from 1 to 10 per cent) would translate into substantial gains in material circularity (0.83–8.33 M. tons of raw material savings per year) and carbon emission reductions in the region (0.95–9.07 Mt CO<inf>2</inf>, i.e. 1.6 to 15.6 per cent of business as usual scenarios equal to reductions of 6 per cent of the total emissions). This scheme could provide further benefits over a nationally self-oriented strategy, revealed by the levels of material exchange within the countries. However, several considerations are essential to make such a scheme feasible. We discuss these critical factors, which are fundamental for a prospective join industrialisation strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cambodia; Cement; Circular Economy; Co-processing; Industrial Symbiosis; Laos; Slag; South-east Asia; Vietnam; Cement Industry; Cements; Economics; Emission Control; Steelmaking; Cambodia; Circular Economy; Coprocessing; Economic Growth Rate; Industrial Symbiosis; Iron Steels; Lao; Regional Co; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; Slags","Cement industry; Cements; Economics; Emission control; Steelmaking; Cambodia; Circular economy; Coprocessing; Economic growth rate; Industrial symbiosis; Iron steels; Lao; Regional CO; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; Slags","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Randy Muth for his comments and suggestions and the reviewers, who significantly improved the quality of this article.

Sodium was selected as the alkaline element, and a standard wire without sodium (wire 1) and three wires with 0.028, 0.056, and 0.084 mass% sodium (wire 2, 3, and 4) were prototyped. They were observed using a high-speed video camera equipped with laser illumination, which clarified that the droplet transfer frequency tended to increase proportionally with the amount of sodium added. Subsequently, the line spectra of the iron atom (particularly the Fe I 537.1 nm line) and sodium atom (particularly the Na I 589.0 nm line) were primarily observed using a bandpass filter. Iron vapor evaporated from the droplet bottom, while sodium vapor mainly evaporated from the molten wire tip or the neck between the wire and the droplet because of its low boiling point. Because the sodium atom has a low ionization energy, we considered that a new current path of sodium plasma was directly formed from the tip or neck of the molten wire through the arc plasma to the molten pool, bypassing the inside of the droplet. The formation of this new current path was considered to reduce the current of the iron plasma flowing from the droplet bottom reducing the arc pressure and further enhance the electromagnetic force acting on the neck to promote droplet detachment, thereby increasing the metal transfer frequency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline Element; Mcaw; Metal Transfer; Metal Vapor; Atoms; Bandpass Filters; Drops; High Speed Cameras; Iron Compounds; Metals; Sodium Compounds; Video Cameras; Alkaline Elements; Arc-welding; Current Paths; High-speed Video Camera; Laser Illumination; Metal Cored Arc Welding; Metal Transfers; Metal Vapor; Sodium Atom; Transfer Process; Wire","Atoms; Bandpass filters; Drops; High speed cameras; Iron compounds; Metals; Sodium compounds; Video cameras; Alkaline elements; Arc-welding; Current paths; High-Speed video camera; Laser illumination; Metal cored arc welding; Metal transfers; Metal vapor; Sodium atom; Transfer process; Wire","","","The authors are grateful for the support toward this study by a joint research agreement between the Joining and Welding Research Institute, Osaka University, Japan; Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam; Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan; Thai Kobelco Welding Co.

Data were collected from 909 employees in Singapore, Thailand and Japan. Results of the study show that there is a positive relationship between several i-deals and affective commitment. However, the effect size of i-deals on each dimension varies across the three countries. In particular, the effect size of task and work responsibilities i-deals on the affective commitment of Japanese employees is stronger than that of Thai employees. Simultaneously, the effect size of the i-deals on affective commitment of Singaporean employees is weaker than that of Thai employees. On the contrary, for the dimensions of schedule and location flexibility and financial incentives, the effect size of i-deals on affective commitment is weaker for Singaporean than for Japanese and Thai, and the effect sizes for Japanese and Thai are the same. The results of this study question the traditionally and universally naive conclusion that i-deals are effective. Although i-deals result in, to some extent, some positive consequences, the results of the study suggest that not in all cases do they increase employee affective commitment. Empirical evidence of the study also demonstrate that the effects i-deals had on employee affective commitment are inconsistent even across cultures with close cultural origin. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comparative Analysis; Idiosyncratic Deals; Japan; Singapore; Thailand","","","","","Adams, J.

Because surimi-based paste contains water and salts, the conductivity is sufficiently good for the ohmic effect. Gelation induced by OH greatly depends on heating conditions such as heating speed, heating time or electrical conductivity. However, the detailed information obtained is quite limited. Therefore, in order to clarify how ohmic heating affects the physical properties of surimi gel under OH, gels from croaker surimi (SA grade) were obtained using different heating conditions (heating rate, heating time, or salt concentration-electrical conductivity). Furthermore, the gels heated by ohmic heating were compared with the gel obtained by conventional water-bath heating. The results showed that, at the same heating rates, higher salt concentration generated better surimi gels for croaker surimi. Gels cooked ohmically at a slow heating rate performed significantly better than those cooked at a fast heating rate or heated conventionally in a water bath. There was little discernible difference in protein pattern between gels heated by OH and conventional water bath heating at fast heating rates with two different salt concentrations. The results also indicated that holding time at target temperature showed no effect on the gel. These results suggested that the properties of heat-induced surimi gels by OH were affected by not only heating speed but also holding time at maximum temperature and salt content. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrical Conductivity; Heating Rate; Ohmic Heating; Physical Properties; Surimi Gel","","","","","Benjakul, Soottawat, Transglutaminase-mediated setting in bigeye snapper Surimi, Food Research International, 36, 3, pp. 253-266, (2003); Benjakul, Soottawat, Suwari gel properties as affected by transglutaminase activator and inhibitors, Food Chemistry, 85, 1, pp. 91-99, (2004); de Alwis, Ajith A.P., Shape and conductivity effects in the ohmic heating of foods, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 67, 2, pp. 159-168, (1989); de Alwis, Ajith A.P., Operability of the ohmic heating process: Electrical conductivity effects, Journal of Food Engineering, 15, 1, pp. 21-48, (1992); FRYER, PETER J., Ohmic processing of solid-liquid mixtures: Heat generation and convection effects, Journal of Food Engineering, 18, 2, pp. 101-125, (1993); Huang, Lihan, Coagulation of fish proteins from frozen fish mince wash water by ohmic heating, Journal of Food Process Engineering, 20, 4, pp. 285-300, (1997); Kamath, G.

The growth experiment was conducted in 500-L tank (250-L water) with triplicates. The stocking density was 300 individuals per tank. Striped snakehead at fry stage showed a high tolerance to temperature ranging from 10 to 40ºC. After 90 days, fish reared in 30°C performed the greatest weight and survival rate (13.1±3.12 g/fish and 15.5±4.63%, respectively). The number of red blood cells and hemoglobin concentrations increased with the increase in temperature. It was discovered that different temperatures (from 27 to 36°C) did not significantly influence the number of white blood cells, osmolality, and ion concentration of fish. Glucose and cortisol concentrations increased with temperature rises and peaked in fish reared at 36°C, while temperatures of 30oC and 33oC showed higher digestive enzyme activities.

The findings indicate that most farmers accurately perceived climate-related changes during the recent decade, and implemented various adaptation measures in an effort to alleviate the potential risks. Adaptations included changing crop varieties, adjusting farming calendar, diversifying crops, diversifying livestock, improving irrigation, and intensifying soil quality. In addition, the farming household adaptation decisions were positively affected by gender, education level, number of laborers, income level, involvement in local community organizations, and perception of climate change severity and adaptation measure efficacy. Farmer adaptations, in contrast, were negatively influenced by non-farm income and entirely unaffected by access to credit. Policy-related recommendations were proposed to encourage smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change in the region. Recommendations included (1) improvements in the understanding of climate change, especially for female and less educated farmers; (2) more attention paid to the activities of local community organizations to be more attractive for members; (3) participation in the non-agricultural sector in parallel with implementing climate change adaptation measures in agriculture; (4) preferential loans designed as targets for low-income households combined with strict management to avoid misuse by beneficiaries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation Decision; Central Vietnam; Climate Change; Phu Vang District; Smallholder Farmers","","","","","Al-amin, Abul Quasem, Analysing the socioeconomic and motivational factors affecting the willingness to pay for climate change adaptation in Malaysia, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 50, (2020); Alam, GM Monirul, Climate change perceptions and local adaptation strategies of hazard-prone rural households in Bangladesh, Climate Risk Management, 17, pp. 52-63, (2017); Arora-Jonsson, Seema, Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change, Global Environmental Change, 21, 2, pp. 744-751, (2011); Asrat, Paulos, Farmers’ perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in the Dabus watershed, North-West Ethiopia, Ecological Processes, 7, 1, (2018); Bakhsh, Khuda, Adaptation to climate change in rain-fed farming system in Punjab, Pakistan, International Journal of the Commons, 13, 2, pp. 833-847, (2019); Bankoff, Greg, A history of poverty: The politics of natural disasters in the Philippines, 1985–95, Pacific Review, 12, 3, pp. 381-420, (1999); Framework for Integrated Water Management in the Thua Thien Hue Province Delft University of Technology, (2014); Agriculture and Development Discussion Paper Series 2017 3, (2023); Bryan, Elizabeth, Adaptation to climate change in Ethiopia and South Africa: options and constraints, Environmental Science and Policy, 12, 4, pp. 413-426, (2009); Coumou, Dim, A decade of weather extremes, Nature Climate Change, 2, 7, pp. 491-496, (2012)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","25097954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100032246"

Vulnerability to food poverty constitutes a certain probability that a non-poor household will become food-poor or that a food-poor household will remain in poverty in future. The results suggest that non-farm employment exerts a positive and statistically significant effect on the reduction in household food poverty and vulnerability. Specifically, participating in non-farm employment will help decrease the probability of falling into food poverty in future by roughly 19%. We also document that 31% of non-food-poor households in rural areas suffered from vulnerability to food poverty, indicating their high probability of falling into food poverty in future.

This paper investigates the determinants of a negative net leverage policy. Previous literature argues that zero-leverage is the result of high growth opportunity. However, by using a sample of Japanese non-financial firms over the period 1991–2015, we find that the driving forces of negative net leverage policy are low growth opportunity, low default possibility, and high cash holdings. Furthermore, a lower risk-free rate induces firms to increase cash holding, and therefore decrease net leverage. As time goes by, negative net leverage firms cease to accumulate cash and gradually repay debt. We suggest that policymakers improve the investment environment and enhance the effective allocation of firm funding, especially during a period of low risk-free rates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash; Investment; Leverage; Net Debt; Zero Leverage","","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful for helpful comments from the editor and two anonymous referees.We would like to thank the participants/discussants at the following workshops/conferences, including World Finance & Banking Symposium (Taichung, Taiwan), Vietnam Symposium in Banking and Finance (Hue city, Vietnam), Royal Economic Society (Sussex, the UK); INFINITI Conference on International Finance (Poznan, Poland); Econometric Research in Finance workshop (Warsaw, Poland), and seminar at Osaka University, Japan.

The material flow analysis (MFA) technique was used throughout the study for calculating efficiency of waste treatment processes and also for conversion/accumulation of materials with purpose to improve the soil quality for cultivation purpose in the garden. The experimental results showed that the garden in the system plays an important role in receiving, conversion, uptake and accumulation of the nutrients from waste flows, and by that way, in effective removal the pollutants from waste flows as well. In this system, the wastewater from catfish ponds was treated by using water morning glory, a local aquatic plant, before to be reused for watering the cultivation plants in the garden, and the removal percentage of Total Organic Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Kallium in wastewater were 33.3, 21.7, 59,5 and 37,5%, respectively. All the solid wastes (sludge from catfish ponds, cow manure from livestock, and absorbed biochar material) were reused as organic fertilizer (compost), and served as sources of additional nutrients for cultivation of Pennisennon purpurecums-schumach grass and maize plants in the garden. Biochar material, which was produced from dried leaves in the garden, was used for treatment of biogas effluent before using later for watering the garden. Total wastewater after being treated and reused for maize plants was 9575 m3/ha, in which absorbed water by maize plant was 48.02 m3/ha, and 9527 m3/ha was evaporated and accumulated in soil. The Nitrogen absorbed by maize plant was 4.12 g/m2, and the soil organic carbon stock in the AZEIS system was 0.19 mg/ha/crop. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agro-based Zero Emission Integrated System (azeis); Catfish Farming; Material Flow Analysis (mfa); Soil Cultivation; Waste Treatment; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Composting; Effluent Treatment; Fertilizers; Integrated Control; Lakes; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Removal; Nutrients; Organic Carbon; Plants (botany); Soil Pollution; Soils; Solid Wastes; Wastewater Reclamation; Wastewater Treatment; Water Treatment; Calculating Efficiencies; Material Flow Analysis; Materials With Purpose; Organic Fertilizers; Soil Organic Carbon Stocks; Total Organic Carbon; Uptake And Accumulations; Waste Treatment Process; Effluents","Agriculture; Air pollution; Composting; Effluent treatment; Fertilizers; Integrated control; Lakes; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soil pollution; Soils; Solid wastes; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Calculating efficiencies; Material flow analysis; Materials with purpose; Organic fertilizers; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Total Organic Carbon; Uptake and accumulations; Waste treatment process; Effluents","","","The research team would like to thank to the Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) for funding the research project KHCN-TNB.ĐT/14–19/C36, the Angiang local authorities for assistance during site investigation and demonstration, and the ASEAN-European Academic University network (ASEA-UNINET) for collaboration with IPPE, TU Graz, Austria, to implement this study.

While the domestic demand of using organic fertilizers for clean agriculture is increasing, these organic materials are disposed in a wasteful way. This study indicated that the nitrogen (N) concentration of the waste that include septic tank sludge (STS), food waste (FW) and sludge from seafood waste water treatment plant (SFS) is quite high by 965 mg/L, 34,314 mg/L and 1,756 mg/L. In this study, an Anaerobic Digester_Continuously Stirred Tank Reaction (ADCSTR) system was established to recover the N from these wastes. The ADCSTR was made of 5 mm thick tempered glass, with the dimension of the tank is H x D x R = 1,000 mm x 300 mm x 300 mm. The C/N ratio used for the ADCSTR was 25, which was identified by pre-testing seven small AD systems with different C/N ratios. The result revealed that after 50 d of anaerobic digestion, the Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N) concentrations of liquid product was 9,628.3 mg/L and 648.5 mg/L, and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) was 11.35 as well, equivalent to 78.2 % of recovering efficiency.

Employing the generalized method of moments and vector error correction model, this study's main contribution to the literature lies in the quantification of the role of quality infrastructure in disaster impact mitigation. The empirical results prove that even if disaster intensity remains the most important factor in explaining damage, this effect is short-lived. At the same time, quality infrastructure significantly reduces damage in the long-term and is the variable with the largest magnitude. A higher level of development indicators, measured by gross domestic product per capita, and control of corruption, are also shown to reduce damage linked to natural disasters. Our study suggests that improving the quality of infrastructure can be effective in mitigating the impact of disasters.

Our sample includes the following Asian countries: China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. Our full sample analysis reveals a strongly connected electricity sector in the sample Asian countries, signifying a substantial influence of Asia's electric utilities on each other. Moreover, our frequency-based analysis exhibits that the connectedness between electricity sectors in Asia is more pronounced in the short-run compared to the long-run horizon. Further, we explore the time-varying connectedness by employing a rolling window analysis that shows the dynamic nature of connectedness and reveals the significant effect of important events like the Chinese financial crisis and the ongoing pandemic crisis. We also explore the connectedness between Asian electricity utility sectors during turbulent times by employing subsample analyses covering the Chinese financial crisis and Pandemic crisis periods. The subsample analyses show that market-wide uncertainty drives up the connectedness, and it is relatively more pronounced for short-run frequencies and during the pandemic crisis period.

This study carried out a structured interview and life cycle assessment to explore the influence of AWD on life-cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions, yields and agronomic management in An Giang Province, Vietnam, which is the 5th-largest rice producer in the world. Farmers in An Giang Province were trained in a course that introduced them to AWD as a technological package known as ‘one must do, five reductions’. All farmers interviewed who attended the course reported that they were implementing AWD (AWD farmers), whereas interviewed farmers who did not attend the course reported that they did not implement AWD (non-AWD farmers). The present study showed that yields were almost identical among the AWD and non-AWD farmers. Irrespective of the water management, on-site burning was practised as straw management by >75% of farmers. Due to the influence of the technological campaigns, AWD allowed farmers in An Giang Province to reduce LC-GHG emissions without decreasing yields significantly and with lower use of fertilizers (nitrogen and phosphate) and seeds. Furthermore, the results suggest that a reduction in the use of fertilizer and seed does not reduce yields significantly for either AWD or non-AWD farmers, but careful straw management is required to avoid an increase in LC-GHG emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Alternate Wetting And Drying; Greenhouse Gas; Life Cycle Assessment; Rice Yield; Agronomy; Economic And Social Effects; Emission Control; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Hydraulic Structures; Nitrogen Fertilizers; Phosphate Fertilizers; Seed; Water Management; Wetting; Emissions Reduction; Ghg Emission; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Management Is; Rice (oryza Sativa L.); Rice Production; Straw Management; Wetting And Drying; Life Cycle","Agronomy; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic structures; Nitrogen fertilizers; Phosphate fertilizers; Seed; Water management; Wetting; Emissions reduction; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management IS; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Rice production; Straw management; WETTING AND DRYING; Life cycle","","","The authors are very thankful to Mr. Huynh Van Thao, Mr. Huynh Cong Khanh, and Ms. Huynh Thi Diem at CanTho University for conducting the farm survey, Dr. Nguyen Xuan Loc at CanTho University for comments on the questionnaire, Dr. Yokoyama in JIRCAS for providing very useful background information and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in An Giang Province for selecting the farmers.","Belder, P., Crop performance, nitrogen and water use in flooded and aerobic rice, Plant and Soil, 273, 1-2, pp. 167-182, (2005); Philipp J Crop Sci, (2016); Bond, Tami C., Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 118, 11, pp. 5380-5552, (2013); Water Management in Irrigated Rice Coping with Water Scarcity, (2007); Quantitative Data Analysis with Spss for Windows A Guide for Social Scientists, (2001); Cai, Zucong, Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy fields as affected by nitrogen fertilisers and water management, Plant and Soil, 196, 1, pp. 7-14, (1997); Carrijo, Daniela R., Rice yields and water use under alternate wetting and drying irrigation: A meta-analysis, Field Crops Research, 203, pp. 173-180, (2017); Chang, Chih Hua, Emissions inventory for rice straw open burning in Taiwan based on burned area classification and mapping using Formosat-2 satellite imagery, Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 13, 2, pp. 474-487, (2013); Omonrice, (2007); Rice A Practical Guide to Nutrient Management, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097711050"

First automatic de-identification systems were based on rules or on machine learning methods, limited by language changes, lack of context awareness and time consuming feature engineering. Newer deep learning techniques for sequence labeling have shown better results with a reduction in feature engineering efforts and the use of word representation techniques in vector space. However, they are not able to jointly represent the polysemic and context-dependent nature of words, as well as their morpho-syntactic mutations characteristic of handwriting. To address these limitations, a new de-identification approach based on deep learning techniques for Named Entity Recognition has been proposed, whose key factors are: (i) a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory + Conditional Random Field architecture for sequence labeling that takes advantage of the widest possible representation context; (ii) a contextualized language model, working at character level, to capture the polysemy of words and manage the morpho-syntactic variations typical of handwritten notes; (iii) more word representations stacked to better capture latent syntactic and semantic similarities. This approach has been tested on the official Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside 2014 de-identification dataset, showing similar or higher performance than state of the art with respect to category and binary recognition, but without any feature engineering or handcrafted rules. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in particular with regard to category level recognition which is essential to correctly replace entities with surrogates for anonymization purposes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical De-identification; Contextualized Embedding; Deep Learning; Named Entity Recognition; Sub-document Level Analysis; Character Recognition; Data Sharing; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Random Processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Vector Spaces; Conditional Random Field; Feature Engineerings; Learning Techniques; Named Entity Recognition; Protected Health Informations; Semantic Similarity; Syntactic Variations; Word Representations; Long Short-term Memory","Character recognition; Data Sharing; Deep learning; Learning systems; Random processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Vector spaces; Conditional random field; Feature engineerings; Learning techniques; Named entity recognition; Protected health informations; Semantic similarity; Syntactic variations; Word representations; Long short-term memory","","","","Vincze, Veronika, De-identification in natural language processing, pp. 1300-1303, (2014); Meystre, Stéphane M., Automatic de-identification of textual documents in the electronic health record: A review of recent research, BMC Medical Research Methodology, 10, (2010); Stubbs, Amber, Automated systems for the de-identification of longitudinal clinical narratives: Overview of 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task Track 1, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 58, pp. S11-S19, (2015); Yadav, Vikas, A survey on recent advances in named entity recognition from deep learning models, pp. 2145-2158, (2018); Akbik, Alan, Contextual string embeddings for sequence labeling, pp. 1638-1649, (2018); Pennington, Jeffrey S., GloVe: Global vectors for word representation, pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Nadeau, David, A survey of named entity recognition and classification, Lingvisticae Investigationes, 30, 1, pp. 3-26, (2007); Dernoncourt, Franck, De-identification of patient notes with recurrent neural networks, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 24, 3, pp. 596-606, (2017); Sweeney, Latanya A., Replacing personally-identifying information in medical records, the Scrub system., Proceedings : a conference of the American Medical Informatics Association / .

During the workshop, 19 questions related to water challenges in HCMC were given and participants prioritized them from the standpoints of the current and an imaginary future generations, respectively. Respondents and questions were each assigned to six groups by cluster analysis of the answers. From the standpoint of the imaginary future generation, three groups of respondents placed higher priority on many issues including the global-scale environmental issue, demonstrating a clear shift of perception depending on the perspective. Their future images of HCMC were deplorable, with more severe climate change impacts, leading to pessimistic answers to the questions. In contrast, two respondent groups that imagined an optimistic HCMC future, where sufficient economic and technological development will solve the issues, placed lower priority on most of the issues. These results suggest that the shifts of people's perception by the introduction of a future generation's perspective are likely to be affected by the future that they imagine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Citizen Workshop; Future Design; Imaginary Future Generation; Questionnaire Survey; Vietnam; Water Environment Issues; Design; Environmental Issue; Future Prospect; Participatory Approach; Perception; Questionnaire Survey; Water Management; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam","design; environmental issue; future prospect; participatory approach; perception; questionnaire survey; water management; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported in part by ?Design and Reform of Social Systems Enabling Transformation to Sustainable Society? under Transdisciplinary Researches for Problem Solutions, the Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society (RISTEX), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

When internal customers are satisfied, they will become more loyal and committed to the company. Internal customers will be ready to serve to satisfy and create loyalty of customers outside the business. Thus, internal marketing needs to be done before doing external marketing. The function of internal marketing is that the internal communication between the business and its employees must function effectively before the business can succeed in realizing its goals in relation to the external market.

The data was collected from the survey results of officials and employees at garment enterprises in the province. The data were processed by the statistical software SPSS 22.0, the scale was tested by Cronbach Alpha coefficient and the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) model.

The main aimof the study was to support women smallholder farmers and stakeholders in understanding their current complex situations for making practical and sustainable decisions in developing an integrated master plan for reducing (initially) their workload. However, as a more in-depth understanding started to develop, it became clear that their quality of life is the main issue (of which workload was only one dimension of the sustainable farming system as a whole). This was done by introducing women and all relevant stakeholders to an innovative systems-based framework, namely, the Evolutionary Learning Laboratory (ELLab), for use through two community-based, participatory projects in the poorest regions of the world. Various stakeholders engaged with each other in sharing their mental models about the issues involved in determining the quality of life of the disadvantaged and marginalized women farmers. These mental models served as inputs for developing systems models to help develop a shared understanding of the bigger systems in which women farmers in both countries are operating. Income, work pressure, and health were identified as the major determinants of the quality of life of women in both countries, while “dignity” was also identified by women in Ghana as an important factor. This chapter also discusses the value and validity of the ELLab approach in dealing with complex problems in cross-cultural and different environmental settings. Outcomes from each case study were discussed and compared to provide evidence of the practical contributions of this research to sustainable management through engaging and addressing the real concerns and needs of the marginalized groups in the two regions. Both case studies have shown that the systems-based ELLab has proved to be a powerful management framework to address complex problems in which relationships of natural (environmental) and human factors, cultural differences, and socioeconomic aspects and relationships among stakeholders are all intrinsically interwoven. The ELLab clearly supported the development of systemically defined management plans for the two cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-learning; Community Empowerment; Complexity Management; Evolutionary Learning Laboratory; Gender Inequity; Knowledge Integration; Marginalized Communities; Participatory Systems Analysis; Stakeholder Involvement; Systems Thinking","","","","","Systems Thinking in the Forestry Value Chain A Case Study of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Isss 2009, (2009); Small Farms as A Planetary Ecological Asset Five Key Reasons Why We Should Support the Revitalisation of Small Farms in the Global South, (2008); Concepts and Practices in Agricultural Extension in Developing Countries A Source Book, (2008); Banson, Kwamina Ewur, A Systems Thinking Approach to Address the Complexity of Agribusiness for Sustainable Development in Africa: A Case Study in Ghana, Systems Research and Behavioral Science, 32, 6, pp. 672-688, (2015); International Journal of Markets and Business Systems, (2015); Banson, Kwamina Ewur, Using System Archetypes to Identify Drivers and Barriers for Sustainable Agriculture in Africa: A Case Study in Ghana, Systems Research and Behavioral Science, 33, 1, pp. 79-99, (2016); Country Study for the Neuchatel Initiative, (2001); Labor Saving Technologies and Practices for Farming and Household Activities in Eastern and Southern Africa, (2003); Guidelines for Adaptive Management Outcomes of the Ozam 2003 Workshop, (2004); Improving the Triple Bottom Line Returns from Small Scale Forestry, (2007)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","","9789811507199; 9789811507205","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153638331"

The current system of PA governance contributes to the protection of biodiversity, albeit in an overlapping and complicated manner. The greatest contribution of policy towards PAs is the decentralization and delegation of additional powers to provincial and municipal authorities. Decentralization triggers diverse forms of investment for tourism, which is commonly espoused as a solution to balance the concurrent needs of economic development and biodiversity conservation. However, more recently, by analysing resource politics in the mountain area of Hoang Lien National Park (HLNP), the authors contend that a recentralization of resource management is evident in a new form of partnership investment in mega tourism projects. In addition to analysis of resource governance and management, the chapter highlights major challenges to the promotion of nature-based tourism in and around PAs as a sustainable livelihood for locals. Having discussed these challenges in the context of HLNP against the backdrop of tourism development, issues concerning tourism policy, governance, and livelihoods are addressed in the context of PAs’ fragile ecological systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Governance; Hoang Lien National Park; Nature-based Tourism; Protected Areas","","","","Government funding for SUFs comes from a wide range of funds to ‘develop’ national parks (both provincial and national). The 5 Million Hectare Reforestation Program is commonly used for forest protection contracts and tree planting in buffer zones, as well as ‘ecological regeneration’ areas within PA core zones. The 135 Program from the Infrastructure Development Fund administered by Ministry of Planning and Investment can finance local infrastructure, such as schools and irrigation systems, in buffer zones, and is often used to construct buildings and roads inside PAs. Management boards can also apply to the Department of Science, Technology and Product Quality of MARD for funding to support research, although capacity to review prepare proposals to access these funds is limited (ICEM, 2003). International donors, such as WWF, FFI, ILO are another source of funds for conservation management. Most donor support is for large, site-specific projects and is often used for investment and the conservation needs that the government budgets cannot meet. This source of funds is increasingly important and functions as a vehicle to attract foreign researchers and visitors to PAs (ICEM, 2003).","An, Le Thanh, The comparative analyses of selected aspects of conservation and management of Vietnam's national parks, Nature Conservation, 25, pp. 1-30, (2018); Development of A National Ecotourism Strategy for Vietnam, (1999); Austrian Journal of South East Asian Studies, (2011); Sustainable Financing of Protected Areas A Global Review of Challenges and Options, (2006); Pa Financing Mechanism in Vietnam Lessons Learned and Future Direction, (2011); Gaughan, Andrea Elizabeth, Tourism, forest conversion, and land transformations in the Angkor basin, Cambodia, Applied Geography, 29, 2, pp. 212-223, (2009); Report of Management of Sufs, (2019); Nien Giam Th Ong Ke to Ng Diu Tra Dan S O 2010 National Vietnamese Census Year Book, (2010); Bu O C Du Nghien Cu U Hot Dng Du Lch Trekking Ti Vu O N Qu Oc Gia Hoang Lien Theo Quan Die M Du Lch Sinh Thai Exploratory Study on Trekking Tourism in Hoang Lien National Park an Ecotourism View, (2010); Hoang, Huong Thi Thu, Changing human-landscape interactions after development of tourism in the northern Vietnamese Highlands, Anthropocene, 5, pp. 42-51, (2014)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","23665629; 23665610","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129930909"

The data is from the fourth-round dataset of the High- Performance Manufacturing Project, collected from manufacturing plants worldwide. The results indicate that (1) quality information is positively associated with quality performance through process control, and (2) shop floor leadership (i.e., supervisory interaction facilitation) positively moderates the indirect effect of quality information on quality performance; that is, the shop floor leadership practice strengthens the effect of quality information on quality performance through process control.

The development and state-of-art issue of household biogas, specifically, the opportunities and constraints of household biogas are presented in this paper. There are several opportunities for household biogas development, including, the availability of biogas fermentation materials, energy shortage issues, and policy support from the Government of Vietnam and international organizations. Besides, barriers encountered in household biogas development in Vietnam included technical barriers, financial policy barriers, awareness and capacity limitations. The capacity building should include the dissemination and update of policy to maintain transparency and credibility for attracting potential domestic investors.

Results suggest that although income from non-farm activities contributes to relaxing credit constraints among farmers, such alleviation does not necessarily allow farmers to increase their on-farm investments. We found that in the developed regions where farmers participate and earn more from non-farm activities, despite there being a low level of credit constraints, their investment in agriculture is still limited due to the labour constraints of the farm household. In contrast, in the less developed regions, where farmers have less access to non-farm income sources, they tend to invest their non-farm income in on-farm activities. The article contributes to the literature by showing that differ-ences in credit constraints levels lead to variations in farm households’ decisions on whether or not to direct non-farm income towards investment in agricultural production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Inputs Investment; Credit/liquidity Constraints; Non-farm Activities; Regions; Vietnam","","","","","Humanities and Social Sciences, (2020); Ahituv, Avner, Off-farm work and capital accumulation decisions of farmers over the life-cycle: The role of heterogeneity and state dependence, Journal of Development Economics, 68, 2, pp. 329-353, (2002); Anríquez, G., Linkages between the farm and nonfarm sectors at the household level in rural Ghana: A consistent stochastic distance function approach, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 41, 1, pp. 51-66, (2010); Barrett, Christopher B., Nonfarm income diversification and household livelihood strategies in rural Africa: Concepts, dynamics, and policy implications, Food Policy, 26, 4, pp. 315-331, (2001); Bui, Khac Linh, Non-farm employment, food poverty and vulnerability in rural Vietnam, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 23, 5, pp. 7326-7357, (2021); Carter, Michael R., Getting institutions ""right"" for whom?

In the national energy efficiency program, the government set the target of saving 7.0% of the energy consumption in the period of 2019–2030 (Government of Viet Nam (2020)). Although there are a number of fiscal measures with major government-led financing facilities dedicated for energy efficiency (EE) technologies with preferential term loans coupled with technical assistance, EE investment in Viet Nam is still at a nascent stage and leaves room for development in the coming time. The impediments preventing EE investment come from lacking the motivation to adopt EE technologies as a result of low energy (electricity) costs; the reluctance of the domestic financial market in financing EE projects when professional expertise is unqualified and inexperienced to confidently implement credit appraisals and lending decisions to the EE that is perceived as a niche, and a new segment with the high level of credit risk. Besides, the underdevelopment of energy saving companies’ operation in offering EE solutions and financing options is also an issue resulting in an immature EE investment environment in the country. To achieve the national target of EE and scaling-up EE investment with the outlook of market-based solutions for EE in Viet Nam in the future, major recommendations include focusing on dedicated EE facilities to energy-intensive industry, promulgating necessary regulations and policies to facilitate energy saving companies, and amending and revising the electricity pricing policy to increase users’ motivation to EE technologies.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the stringency of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) countermeasures in Japan against their G20 cohorts. Primary data were monitored at a ski resort in Kyushu regarding the social acceptance of initial COVID-19 countermeasures, ranging from hygiene and local “lockdowns” to border control measures. Design/methodology/approach: The stringency of the COVID-19 countermeasures was examined using data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) and triangulated with the early stage social acceptance of survey respondents in Aso Kuju National Park in February 2020 that consisted of 165 valid Japanese language questionnaires. Findings: An one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified significant differences in social acceptance for countermeasures, with more-concerned respondents agreeing more strongly with “low-tech” health protocols, such as washing hands (M = 3.7) or wearing a mask (3.4). More concerned visitors were significantly more likely to modify their travel plans (2.9) or cancel their trip altogether (2.7). Male day trippers were less likely to be concerned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This paper's originality is derived from a triangulation of the stringency of Japan's initial COVID-19 countermeasures via a combination of comparison with G20 cohorts and social acceptance of domestic snowboarders and skiers. Moreover, by shining a light on the trade-off between public health and human rights, the paper provides a current review of the ethical dimension of a travel restriction debate that is often overlooked in the ongoing pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coronavirus; Covid-19 Counter-measures; Domestic Perceptions; Human Rights; International Tourists; Social Acceptance; Stringency; Travel Restrictions","","","","Thank you to the survey respondents, Kujyu Forest Park Skiing Ground and the Japanese Ministry of Environment.","An, Brian Y., Lessons From COVID-19 Responses in East Asia: Institutional Infrastructure and Enduring Policy Instruments, American Review of Public Administration, 50, 6-7, pp. 790-800, (2020); Anzai, Asami, Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (Covid-19), Journal of Clinical Medicine, 9, 2, (2020); Baum, Tom G., Hospitality, tourism, human rights and the impact of COVID-19, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 32, 7, pp. 2397-2407, (2020); Brug, Johannes, SARS risk perception, knowledge, precautions, and information sources, the Netherlands, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 10, 8, pp. 1486-1489, (2004); Cai, Hua, Sex difference and smoking predisposition in patients with COVID-19, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 8, 4, (2020); Chen, Justin A., Potential impact of COVID-19-related racial discrimination on the health of Asian Americans, American Journal of Public Health, 110, 11, pp. 1624-1627, (2020); Chen, Simiao, Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies, The Lancet, 395, 10232, pp. 1305-1314, (2020); Chia, Terkuma I., Human health versus human rights: An emerging ethical dilemma arising from coronavirus disease pandemic, Ethics, Medicine and Public Health, 14, (2020); Choi, Jiyoung, Smart Korea: Governance for smart justice during a global pandemic, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 29, 2-3, pp. 540-549, (2021); Cooper, Malcolm J.M., Japanese tourism and the SARS epidemic of 2003, Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 19, 2-3, pp. 117-131, (2006)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","2055592X; 20555911","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109873158"

Design/methodology/approach: The data were obtained from a survey of 552 employees of four companies in Japan and analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings: The results show that state anxiety has a significantly positive effect on rule adherence and kaizen performance. Trait anxiety positively influences employees' initiative and perseverance but has a significant negative effect on kaizen performance.

A simple spectrometric system is practical in principle, but its manufacturability and reproducibility were somehow limited in the previous studies because they were based on discrete components such as filters or LEDs. High manufacturability and reproducibility of our developed system were already reported, but the performance of sweetness grading was not examined. In this study, the best performance of 91.3% accuracy and 91.5% precision was obtained from a discriminant analysis (DA) model that was trained with the spectral response of apple at five wavebands (535, 680, 730, 760, and 900 nm) selected with a sequential forward selection (SFS) algorithm. The performance level was superior to that of the previous studies on their simple spectrometric systems. From the achieved performance and evaluated computational complexity, it can be concluded that the combination of a machine learning-based classifier and our simple spectrometric system is effective for fruit quality assessment and especially suitable for cost-effective applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classifier; Machine Learning; Multispectral Sensor; Sweetness Grading; Vis-nir Spectrometer; Cost Effectiveness; Discriminant Analysis; Fruits; Grading; Machine Learning; Quality Control; Spectrometry; Turing Machines; Cost Effective; Discrete Components; Manufacturability; Multispectral Sensors; Performance Level; Reproducibilities; Sequential Forward Selection; Spectral Response; Software Engineering","Cost effectiveness; Discriminant analysis; Fruits; Grading; Machine learning; Quality control; Spectrometry; Turing machines; Cost effective; Discrete components; Manufacturability; Multispectral sensors; Performance level; Reproducibilities; Sequential forward selection; Spectral response; Software engineering","","","","Nicolaï, Bart M., Nondestructive measurement of fruit and vegetable quality, Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, 5, 1, pp. 285-312, (2014); Wang, Hailong, Fruit quality evaluation using spectroscopy technology: A review, Sensors, 15, 5, pp. 11889-11927, (2015); Saeed, Osama Mohamed Ben, Classification of oil palm fresh fruit bunches based on their maturity using portable four-band sensor system, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 82, pp. 55-60, (2012); Giovenzana, Valentina, Testing of a simplified LED based vis/NIR system for rapid ripeness evaluation of white grape (Vitis vinifera L.) for Franciacorta wine, Talanta, 144, pp. 584-591, (2015); Setiawan, Agung Wahyu, Classification of palm oil fresh fruit bunch using multiband optical sensors, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 9, 4, pp. 2386-2393, (2019); Kim Seng, Chia, Pre-dispersive near-infrared light sensing in non-destructively classifying the brix of intact pineapples, Journal of Food Science and Technology, 57, 12, pp. 4533-4540, (2020); Tran, Nhut Thanh, A portable spectrometric system for quantitative prediction of the soluble solids content of apples with a pre-calibrated multispectral sensor chipset, Sensors, 20, 20, pp. 1-11, (2020); Brix as A Metric of Fruit Maturity, (2019); Ding, Chris H.Q., Minimum redundancy feature selection from microarray gene expression data, Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, 3, 2, pp. 185-205, (2005); Peng, Yankun, Prediction of apple fruit firmness and soluble solids content using characteristics of multispectral scattering images, Journal of Food Engineering, 82, 2, pp. 142-152, (2007)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","International Association for Computer and Information Science (ACIS)","21st ACIS International Semi-Virtual Winter Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing, SNPD-Winter 2021","","Ho Chi Minh City","168473","","9780738125510","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105073723"

However, a seamless viewing experience can not be just simply guaranteed by HAS only. In the management network, the adaptation of HAS copes with a huge challenge since client-driven schemes lead to unfair share of available bandwidth when multiple players request adaptive bitrates (i.e bandwidth) through a bottleneck network link. Each client's requesting to maximize its needed bandwidth leads to the competition of network resources. This causes great QoE (Quality of Experience) reduction in terms of main metrics for each player: fairness, efficiency, and stability. In this paper, we propose an integration scheme of bitrate adaptation and Software Defined Networking-based resource allocation that can improve the QoE of competing clients. Our experiments show that the proposed scheme increases at least 20% up to 124% in terms of QoE scores compared with some existing methods as well as gains smoother viewing experience than the solutions of the traditional Internet. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Bitrate Streaming - Abr; Http Video Streaming; Qoe; Resource Allocation; Sdn; Traffic Shaping","","","","This paper is an extension of work originally presented in the ICTC conference [4].

In order to do so, this study developed and tested a theoretical model emphasizing tourists’ overall satisfaction with their trip to a festival and their future intentions toward the festival destination. Data were collected from domestic attendees of a flower festival in Da Lat City, Vietnam (n = 278) using a structured questionnaire, and were analyzed using the structural equational modeling method. The findings revealed that the confirmation of personal values was the most important contributor to overall satisfaction, in addition to the satisfaction with destination attributes and festival events. Moreover, place attachment was the most significant antecedent of future intention to recommend and intention to return to the festival destination, together with overall satisfaction and life satisfaction. Based on the findings, several practical implications for the management and marketing of the future Da Lat Flower Festivals in the domestic market were proposed.

Using cross-sectional data covering over 25,000 firms worldwide and by employing various empirical methods, we find robust evidence that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) tend to be less profitable than private-owned enterprises. However, they appear to use debt for their financial need and are, thus, better leveraged. SOEs are also more labor-intensive and have higher labor costs. In addition, an improvement in institutional quality could benefit both SOEs and POEs. Thus, evidence from this study could be interpreted to mean that privatization could improve the performance of public firms; however, this process should come with several prior-privatization approaches. A study over a more extended period is needed before these results can be considered conclusive. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","G32; G341; Ownership; Performance; Private-owned Enterprises; Solvency; State-owned Enterprises","","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the Editor-in-Chief of Emerging Markets Finance and Trade and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments that helped a lot in revising the paper and preparing the current version.

The month-end dataset, and asymmetric error correction model, autoregressive distributed lag regression and vector autoregressive regression are utilized to measure the degree of ultimate pass-through, adjustment speed, and short-run pass-through of the two-stage interest rate pass-through process. Our results indicate quick responses in market rates to changes in policy rates; and incomplete long-run pass-through coupled with delayed impact and slow adjustment from market rates to retail rates; while the responses appear to be symmetric with respect to the direction of change of rates. Moreover, the positive impact of the State Bank's regime shift on the effectiveness of the interest rate transmission is another important finding of this study.

This paper measures the volatility of market risk in Vietnam banking industry after this period (2015-2017). The main reason is the vital role of the bank system in Vietnam in the economic development and growth in recent years always goes with risk potential and risk control policies. This research paper aims to figure out the increase or decrease in the market risk of Vietnam banking firms during the post-low inflation period 2015-2017. First, by using the quantitative combined with comparative data analysis method, we find out the risk level measured by equity beta mean in the banking industry is acceptable, although it is little higher than (>) 1. Then one of its major findings is the comparison between risk level of banking industry during the financial crisis 2007-2009 compared to those in the post-low inflation time 2015-2017. In fact, the research findings show us market risk level during the post-low inflation time has increased much. We compare beta in two periods because we want to figure out the reason underlying the fact beta has increased. One of the reasons is that the accumulated banking risks during the longer time and criteria to meet Basel 2 have been partially contributing to increasing market risk. Finally, this paper provides some ideas that could provide companies and government more evidence in establishing their policies in governance. This is the complex task but the research results show us warning that the market risk might be higher during the post-low inflation period 2015-2017. Our conclusion part will recommend some policies and plans to deal with it. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Beta; Banking Industry; Financial Crisis; Policy; Risk Management; Banking; Capital Flow; Capital Market; Financial Crisis; Financial Policy; Inflation; Market System; Viet Nam","banking; capital flow; capital market; financial crisis; financial policy; inflation; market system; Viet Nam","","","","Adb and Viet Nam Fact Sheet, (2010); Review of Financial Studies, (1992); Ang, Andrew, CAPM over the long run: 1926-2001, Journal of Empirical Finance, 14, 1, pp. 1-40, (2007); Capm and Time Varying Beta the Cross Section of Expected Returns, (2007); 1994 Annual Meeting Review, (2001); Capm and Beta in an Imperfect Market, (2003); Bank Leverage Ratios and Financial Stability A Micro and Macro Prudential Perspective, (2015); Galagedera, Don U.A., An alternative perspective on the relationship between downside beta and CAPM beta, Emerging Markets Review, 8, 1, pp. 4-19, (2007); Amity Journal of Finance, (2016); Khwaja, Asim Ijaz, Unchecked intermediaries: Price manipulation in an emerging stock market, Journal of Financial Economics, 78, 1, pp. 203-241, (2005)","","World Scientific","","","","","","17936705; 02190915","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095855114"

By employing village-census panel data from original household surveys, our investigation shows that, while agricultural extension service motivated farmers to adopt the new rice variety in the initial period, information sharing among the peers facilitated further adoption in the following period. After an early boost from agricultural extension services, adoption largely took place through social learning among the peers. Social networks of the wives had a greater influence on new rice variety adoption than those of the husbands. By applying the combination of the difference-in-differences method and propensity score weighted regression, our results show that the new rice variety adoption improved productivity and reduced pesticide use.

Disaggregating this total effect, however, reveals more noteworthy issues in the Vietnamese context. Corruption directly impedes growth rates by reducing the efficiency of investments, and this effect is more intense in provinces and cities with higher investment rates.

In this study of Vietnamese folktales, through the use of Bayesian multilevel modeling and the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we offer empirical evidence for how the interplay between religious teachings (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) and deviant behaviors (lying and violence) could affect a folktale’s outcome. The findings indicate that characters who lie and/or commit violent acts tend to have bad endings, as intuition would dictate, but when they are associated with any of the above Three Teachings, the final endings may vary. Positive outcomes are seen in cases where characters associated with Confucianism lie and characters associated with Buddhism act violently. The results supplement the worldwide literature on discrepancies between folklore and real-life conduct, as well as on the contradictory human behaviors vis-à-vis religious teachings.

The area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham Marine Protected Area (MPA), central Vietnam, has been reported to be declining in recent years. However, there has not been any study on assessing the changes in the area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham MPA, especially by the application of remote sensing technology for evaluating temporal and spatial changes. The aim of this study is to establish the current status and document historical changes using maps of seagrass area in Cu Lao Cham MPA, central Vietnam, during the period of 2003–2017. This is the first study on assessing the temporal and spatial changes in the area of seagrass beds in central Vietnam using remote sensing technology. The study integrated field surveys, satellite remote sensing and GIS methods to analyse ALOS AVNIR-2 and Landsat satellite image data during the period of 2003–2017. The Kappa coefficients and overall accuracies of the years 2003, 2010 and 2017 were generally higher than 89% and 0.83, respectively, in all cases. Seagrass beds have mainly distributed near small islands such as Hon La, Hon Tai and Hon Dai. In particular, seagrass beds have almost disappeared at Bai Ong and Bai Huong in April 2017. In the period of 2003–2017, the area of the seagrass bed experienced significant changes. The seagrass area loss was 40.17 ha, and it gained 58.6 ha in the period of 2003–2010. In the period of 2010–2017, the loss of seagrass area was 68.76 ha, and the new addition was 7.27 ha. The study has identified a number of impacts of declining seagrass areas including marine pollution, changes in natural conditions and some other direct impacts from human activities and tourism. The results of this study could contribute to conservation of seagrass resources and sustainable livelihood development for the local community. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Landsat; Marine Protected Area; Remote Sensing; Seagrass; Temporal And Spatial Changes; Accuracy Assessment; Alos; Gis; Landsat; Marine Pollution; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Seagrass; Viet Nam","accuracy assessment; ALOS; GIS; Landsat; marine pollution; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seagrass; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (Nafosted) under Grant No. 106.06-2017.340 and the Global School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University’s Seeds Funding programme for construction of global environmental study basis (2018–2019).

Studies have yet to investigate not only the institutional factors affecting VietGAHP adoption in household pig farming, but also the impact of such adoption on its criteria’ implementation. The objective of this study is to investigate the factors associated with VietGAHP adoption in household pig production and its impact on implementing its criteria. A Probit model was used to directly indicate the determinants of VietGAHP adoption, and a z test revealed the VietGAHP’s impact by comparing the differences in each criterion’s compliance rates between adopter and non-adopter groups. The results demonstrate that the factors positively contributing to VietGAHP adoption include gender, training, household income, and veterinary services, with the training factor as a substantial contributor. The factors presenting a challenge to this adoption included farm size, the number of family members participating in pig-raising, off-farm income, and biogas, with the latter an especially pivotal factor. Moreover, an expected result of the government’s support was that VietGAHP adoption had a positive impact on 9 out 15 compulsory practices and 8 of 14 optional practices. These imply that to attain food safety and environmental protection goals through a public GAP program for pig production, traditional adoption factors—including a male farmer status, training, household wealth, and veterinary services—remain key pillars on which government policies should focus. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compliance; Household; Pig Production; Public Good Agricultural Practices; Vietgahp Adoption; Vietnam; Biogas; Compliance; Environmental Protection; Farm Size; Food Safety; Household Structure; Numerical Model; Pig; Policy Making; Animalia; Suidae","biogas; compliance; environmental protection; farm size; food safety; household structure; numerical model; pig; policy making; Animalia; Suidae","","","This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H00960.","Amekawa, Yuichiro, Reflections on the growing influence of good agricultural practices in the Global South, Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 22, 6, pp. 531-557, (2009); Asfaw, Solomon, Impact of modern agricultural technologies on smallholder welfare: Evidence from Tanzania and Ethiopia, Food Policy, 37, 3, pp. 283-295, (2012); Baumgart-Getz, Adam, Why farmers adopt best management practice in the United States: A meta-analysis of the adoption literature, Journal of Environmental Management, 96, 1, pp. 17-25, (2012); Coulibaly, Jeanne Y., Adoption of agroforestry and the impact on household food security among farmers in Malawi, Agricultural Systems, 155, pp. 52-69, (2017); Feder, Gershon, Adoption of agricultural innovations in developing countries: a survey., Economic Development and Cultural Change, 33, 2, pp. 255-298, (1985); Ghimire, Raju, Factors Affecting Adoption of Improved Rice Varieties among Rural Farm Households in Central Nepal, Rice Science, 22, 1, pp. 35-43, (2015); Journal of Economics and Developments, (2016); Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2007, (2008); Results of the Rural Agricultural and Fishery Census 2016, (2018); Incentives for the Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices, (2003)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V. editorial@springerplus.com","","","","","","15732975; 1387585X","","EDSNB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075984425"

In this respect, the power generation of such a technology is highly impacted by several factors, such as temperature and solar irradiance. As an effective solution, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) approaches have been developed and used in PV systems to increase the efficiency subject to the changing climate conditions. In this respect, a combinatorial MPPT technique is presented in this paper based on the fuzzy controller and BAT optimization algorithm to desirably tune the control parameters. To this end, the membership functions of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are appropriately specified to cope with uncertainties caused by changing climatic conditions. The studied PV system, equipped with the MPPT technique, operates jointly with an electrical energy storage system which is based on a lead-acid battery. By employing this hybrid generation system, the solar power generation intermittency can be well compensated and the stabilized power output can be achieved. The proposed model is then simulated on a typical hybrid energy system, including a PV system and a battery energy storage (BES) system. In this respect, the superior performance of the suggested control scheme is verified through making a comprehensive comparison with other well-known techniques. Besides, the behavior of the system under varying climate conditions is studied and the desired performance of the suggested combinatorial controller is validated. For example, the presented BAT-FLC scheme can help the hybrid system reach 99% efficiency for partial shading conditions (PSCs) which is 18% more compared to the prevalent perturb and observe (P&O) technique. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bat Optimization Algorithm; Battery; Fuzzy Logic System; Hybrid Energy System; Mppt; Photovoltaic; Controllers; Energy Storage; Fuzzy Logic; Hybrid Systems; Lead Acid Batteries; Maximum Power Point Trackers; Membership Functions; Solar Energy; Solar Power Plants; Temperature Control; Tracking (position); Battery Energy Storages (bes); Comprehensive Comparisons; Electrical Energy Storage Systems; Hybrid Generation System; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques; Optimization Algorithms; Photovoltaic Generation; Solar Power Generation","Controllers; Energy storage; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid systems; Lead acid batteries; Maximum power point trackers; Membership functions; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Temperature control; Tracking (position); Battery energy storages (BES); Comprehensive comparisons; Electrical energy storage systems; Hybrid generation system; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Maximum power point tracking techniques; Optimization algorithms; Photovoltaic generation; Solar power generation","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Lac Hong University.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Lac Hong University.","Ahmadi, Abdollah, Information-Gap Decision Theory for Robust Security-Constrained Unit Commitment of Joint Renewable Energy and Gridable Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 16, 5, pp. 3064-3075, (2020); Ahmed, Jubaer, A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV system using Cuckoo Search with partial shading capability, Applied Energy, 119, pp. 118-130, (2014); Ahmed, Emad M., Multifunctional distributed MPPT controller for 3P4W grid-connected PV systems in distribution network with unbalanced loads, Energies, 12, 24, (2019); Barzkar, Arash, A novel peak load shaving algorithm via real-time battery scheduling for residential distributed energy storage systems, International Journal of Energy Research, 42, 7, pp. 2400-2416, (2018); Chen, Weiming, An efficient day-ahead cost-based generation scheduling of a multi-supply microgrid using a modified krill herd algorithm, Journal of Cleaner Production, 272, (2020); Dadfar, Sajjad, Enhanced control strategies for a hybrid battery/photovoltaic system using FGS-PID in grid-connected mode, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 44, 29, pp. 14642-14660, (2019); Dârâban, Stefan R., A novel MPPT (maximum power point tracking) algorithm based on a modified genetic algorithm specialized on tracking the global maximum power point in photovoltaic systems affected by partial shading, Energy, 74, C, pp. 374-388, (2014); Farajdadian, Shahriar, Optimization of fuzzy-based MPPT controller via metaheuristic techniques for stand-alone PV systems, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 44, 47, pp. 25457-25472, (2019); Hosseini, S.

An experimental approach using an advanced X-ray visualization system was employed to clarify this relationship. The results indicated that two large eddies are produced in the weld pool. One exhibits an upward tendency (upper eddy) and the other a downward tendency (lower eddy). The relative strength of each eddy significantly changed depending on the welding current through the change in the keyhole profile (shape and size). For a suitable welding current, the lower eddy was larger and much longer than the upper eddy. Virtually no welding defects were found out in the cross-section and longitudinal sections of the weld pool and keyhole. In the case of low current, the upper eddy was larger and longer than the lower eddy. Severe undercut and humping phenomena were observed on the top side. Contrarily, for a high welding current, the upper eddy disappeared to only form a significantly large lower eddy that covered the entire weld pool. Here, a severe concave defect on the top surface and a severe burn-through defect on the bottom side of the weld bead were seen. These results indicated that when the penetration ability of an arc on the base metal is sufficient, the relative strength of each eddy should be adjusted to a suitable scale with a larger downward eddy and smaller upward eddy. This can ensure a stable and high welding quality without welding defects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eddy; Heat Transportation; Plasma Keyhole Arc Welding; Welding Defects; X-ray Observation System; Welds; Experimental Approaches; Formation Process; Longitudinal Section; Penetration Ability; Relative Strength; Visualization System; Welding Current; Welding Quality; Electric Welding","Welds; Experimental approaches; Formation process; Longitudinal section; Penetration ability; Relative strength; Visualization system; Welding current; Welding quality; Electric welding","","","","Advanced Welding Processes, (1992); Liu, Zuming, Plasma arc welding: Process variants and its recent developments of sensing, controlling and modeling, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 23, pp. 315-327, (2016); Tanaka, Manabu, A study of thermal pinch effect of welding arcs, Yosetsu Gakkai Ronbunshu/Quarterly Journal of the Japan Welding Society, 25, 2, pp. 336-342, (2007); Martikainen, Jukka K., Conditions for achieving high-quality welds in the plasma-arc keyhole welding of structural steels, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 52, 1, pp. 68-75, (1995); Jia, Chuanbao, Sensing controlled pulse key-holing condition in plasma arc welding, Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China (English Edition), 19, 2, pp. 341-346, (2009); Méndez, Patricio Fernando, Welding processes for aeronautics, Advanced Materials and Processes, 159, 5, pp. 39-43, (2001); Welding Journal, (1992); Taban, Emel, Plasma arc welding of modified 12% Cr stainless steel, Materials and Manufacturing Processes, 24, 6, pp. 649-656, (2009); Metcalfe, J.

The radiation sensitivities of dormant conidium-, germinating conidium-, and mycelium-contaminated wet and dry paper were also determined. A radiation dose capable of inactivating 50% of a 30-sample population was used for comparison. Our results showed that the 50% inactivation dose did not significantly differ between wet and dry dormant conidia. However, the survival percentage of dry dormant conidia was higher than that of wet dormant conidia at a high radiation dose. In contrast, the 50% inactivation doses for dry germinating conidia and dry mycelia were significantly lower than those for wet germinating conidia and wet mycelia, respectively. These results indicate that drought stress increased the radiation sensitivity of germinating conidia and mycelia. We also investigated the mechanical properties of Kohzo-gami irradiated at different doses. The order of the tensile strength of Kohzo-gami relative to that of control samples was as follows: 10 kGy > 30 kGy > 40 kGy. This result suggests that even a 10 kGy radiation dose can affect the mechanical properties of paper. The color change level of Kohzo-gami increased significantly at all doses; however, the National Bureau of Standards rating showed only “slight change” at all doses. The radiation doses required for fungal disinfection varied considerably depending on the fungal species and the total number of fungal cells on contaminated paper. Therefore, it was difficult to determine the standard exposure dose for treatment. However, paper sterilization might not be required, as a combination of low-dose radiation and dryness can effectively kill fungal mycelia on contaminated paper. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conidium; Fungal Contamination; Gamma Irradiation; Japanese Paper; Mycelium","","","","Part of this research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 19H05457 ].","Curr Med Mycol, (2016); Borchers, Andrea T., Mold and Human Health: a Reality Check, Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology, 52, 3, pp. 305-322, (2017); Bratu, Eugen, Archives decontamination by gamma irradiation, Nukleonika, 54, 2, pp. 77-84, (2009); González, María E., Gamma radiation for preservation of biologically damaged paper, Radiation Physics and Chemistry, 63, 3-6, pp. 263-265, (2002); da Silva, Manuela, Inactivation of fungi from deteriorated paper materials by radiation, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation, 57, 3, pp. 163-167, (2006); CHoi, Jong-il, Effect of radiation on disinfection and mechanical properties of Korean traditional paper, Hanji, Radiation Physics and Chemistry, 81, 8, pp. 1051-1054, (2012); Sterflinger, Katja, The revenge of time: Fungal deterioration of cultural heritage with particular reference to books, paper and parchment, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 3, pp. 559-566, (2012); Sato, Yoshinori, Microbial deterioration of tsunami-affected paper-based objects: A case study, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation, 88, pp. 142-149, (2014); Cbs Laboratory Manual Series, (2010); Kumeda, Yuko, Heteroduplex Panel Analysis, a Novel Method for Genetic Identification of Aspergillus Section Flavi Strains, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 67, 9, pp. 4084-4090, (2001)","","Elsevier Masson s.r.l.","","","","","","12962074","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088966606"

One of the prevalent renewable energy technologies is the solar photovoltaic (PV) system. These solar units face some challenges, mainly due to the volatile power generation and frequent oscillations, besides low rate when tracking the maximum power. Accordingly, a novel approach is suggested in this research work to address such drawbacks in the conventional control systems. The presented framework is based on a sliding mode controller (SMC) for the sake of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) applied to solar PV units, taking into account diverse meteorological conditions. In this respect, an efficient optimization algorithm, named “θ-modified krill herd (θ-MKH) method” has been proposed to optimally determine the parameters of the SMC. The operating conditions are online and in the grid-connected state. An overarching comparison has been made between the presented approach and other methods like hill climbing (HC), β technique, fractional Voc, incremental conductance (INC), fuzzy logic controller (FLC), and classic fixed-step perturb and observe (P&O) while taking into consideration diverse meteorological conditions. The developed control framework based on the SMC and θ-MKH guarantees the desirable operation of the PV system in terms of limited oscillations and stable operation with the efficiency of 99.5% in tacking the maximum power point in rational time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mppt; Partial Shading Condition; Photovoltaic; Renewable Energy; Sliding Mode Controller; Variable Step Size; Controllers; Environmental Impact; Fuzzy Logic; Optimization; Sliding Mode Control; Solar Power Generation; Conventional Control Systems; Incremental Conductances (inc); Maximum Power Point Tracking; Meteorological Condition; Optimization Algorithms; Renewable Energy Technologies; Sliding Mode Controller; Solar Photovoltaic System; Maximum Power Point Trackers","Controllers; Environmental impact; Fuzzy logic; Optimization; Sliding mode control; Solar power generation; Conventional control systems; Incremental conductances (INC); Maximum Power Point Tracking; Meteorological condition; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energy technologies; Sliding mode controller; Solar photovoltaic system; Maximum power point trackers","","","This work was supported by Lac Hong University .","Ahmed, Emad M., Multifunctional distributed MPPT controller for 3P4W grid-connected PV systems in distribution network with unbalanced loads, Energies, 12, 24, (2019); Al-Diab, Ahmad, Variable step size P&O MPPT algorithm for PV systems, Proceedings of the International Conference on Optimisation of Electrical and Electronic Equipment, OPTIM, pp. 1097-1102, (2010); Al-Gizi, Ammar Ghalib, The use of ANN to supervise the PV MPPT based on FLC, pp. 703-708, (2017); Arteaga Orozco, M.

However, improving water-use efficiency (WUE) at the livestock farm level has received little attention in current research. This study measures the WUE of pig farms in Vietnam, a tropical Southeast Asian country. There, livestock production consists of three farming systems: industrial farms (IFs), semi-industrial farms (SIFs), and traditional farms (TFs). This study compares the WUE of these farming systems, suggests which of the systems is most sustainable, and proposes solutions to improve the WUE of each system. The results of surveying 247 pig farms and applying data envelopment analysis show that the free use of groundwater resources causes a low average WUE of 52%. IFs (closed pigpens) have the highest WUE, followed by TFs and SIFs (open pigpens). This finding confirms the sustainability of IFs over other types of farming. Furthermore, using Tobit models, we analyze the determinants of the WUE within each farming system. The results show that shortening the fattening phase and decreasing the floor space allowance per pig increase the WUE of TFs and SIFs. In addition, decreasing the depth of the puddles in pigpens and the frequency with which these puddles are drained improve the WUE of IFs. These results suggest a need to revise the design of pigpens in order to reduce water use related to washing and cooling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Envelopment Analysis; Farming System; Livestock Production; Sustainability; Water-use Efficiency; Agriculture; Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency; Groundwater; Groundwater Resources; Mammals; Stress Intensity Factors; Sustainable Development; Tropics; Washing; Asian Countries; Farming System; Large Amounts; Livestock Production; Pig Farming; Tropical Countries; Water Scarcity; Water-use Efficiency; Water Pollution; Ground Water; Alternative Agriculture; Data Envelopment Analysis; Livestock Farming; Sustainability; Wastewater; Water Management; Water Use Efficiency; Airflow; Article; Conceptual Framework; Cooling; Engineering; Farming System; Fluid Intake; Geography; Industrial Farm; Livestock; Mathematical Model; Natural Resource; Pig Farming; Plant Water Use; Semi Industrial Farm; Temperature; Traditional Farm; Water Conservation; Viet Nam; Suidae","Agriculture; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Mammals; Stress intensity factors; Sustainable development; Tropics; Washing; Asian countries; Farming system; Large amounts; Livestock production; Pig farming; Tropical countries; Water scarcity; Water-use efficiency; Water pollution; ground water; alternative agriculture; data envelopment analysis; livestock farming; sustainability; wastewater; water management; water use efficiency; airflow; Article; conceptual framework; cooling; engineering; farming system; fluid intake; geography; industrial farm; livestock; mathematical model; natural resource; pig farming; plant water use; semi industrial farm; temperature; traditional farm; water conservation; Viet Nam; Suidae","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI , Grant Number: JP JAG8H 03968 .","World Food and Agriculture to 2030 50 the 2012 Revision, (2012); Álvarez-Rodríguez, Javier, The influence of drinker device on water use and fertiliser value of slurry from growing-finishing pigs, Animal Production Science, 53, 4, pp. 328-334, (2013); Bian, Yiwen, Efficiency evaluation for regional urban water use and wastewater decontamination systems in China: A DEA approach, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 83, pp. 15-23, (2014); Benchmarking with Dea Sfa and R, (2011); undefined, (2018); Chebil, Ali, Irrigation water efficiency in wheat production in Chbika (Tunisia): Parametric versus Nonparametric Comparisons, Agricultural Economics Review, 15, 1, pp. 72-85, (2014); Chemak, Fraj, The water demand management by monitoring the technology performance and the water use efficiency, American Journal of Environmental Sciences, 8, 3, pp. 241-247, (2012); Chen, Pochi, Measurement of technical efficiency in farrow-to-finish swine production using multi-activity network data envelopment analysis: Evidence from Taiwan, Journal of Productivity Analysis, 38, 3, pp. 319-331, (2012); Coelli, Tim J., Technical, allocative, cost and scale efficiencies in Bangladesh rice cultivation: A non-parametric approach, Journal of Agricultural Economics, 53, 3, pp. 607-626, (2002); Scale and Access Issues Affecting Smallholder Hog Producers in an Expanding Peri Urban Market, (2006)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09213449; 18790658","","RCREE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085745667"

The secondary data included the publications, procurements, databases from both worldwide and in Vietnam. Primary data comprised the results from field-trips in March 2018 and February 2019 that used in-depth interviews with representative key persons of involving stake-holders. Findings: The prevalence of contract farming, vertical expansion and conglomerate mergers mainly boost vertical coordination in the industry, which creates three hierarchy paradigms of governance named the full- and semi-vertically integrated model, and the formal coordinating relation institution. Consequently, consolidation has occurred and lead the swine and pork value chain toward modernization. Research limitations/implications: This study generalizes its first trends of the modernization of the swine-to-pork industry instead of provides its concreted impacts to the involved stakeholders. Social implications: Swine and pork industries retain historical and socio-political issues in Vietnam. Social problems are going to raise if number of traditional swine producers are failed in the competition from the equipped large-scale producers leading by the giant vertically-integrated contractors.

Since branding Danang appears to be unfocused, it is suggested that the city follow a strategy to meet the shared expectations of stakeholders instead of trying to create separate images toward different audiences. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, this study selects the bottom-up approach from the viewpoint of Danang students whose requirement is consistent with those of investors, citizens and tourists. Findings: The finding represents the initial associations of students about Danang as a livable, friendly, dynamic, modern coastal city of tourism and development with many opportunities, potential, attraction, integration and hometown feel. These salient images are exceeded from city characteristics, such as natural endowment, leisure places, beautiful scenes, diverse cuisine, peaceful, suitable living environment, orderly traffic, infrastructure and local people. Besides, crowded caused by development and population growth leads to an unpleasant feeling about narrow spaces but can be overwhelmed by the bustle. Although the result shows the success of Danang in communication, it also figures out the loss of the livable image in local students’ minds. Practical implications: Hence, Danang must boost the positive effects of tourism development and limit its negative side. University–city cooperation through co-branding strategies can be considered a solution. Originality/value: The study contributes not only to branding Danang but also to the literature because this is the first complete application of the Zaltman metaphor elicitation technique in city branding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consensus Map; Danang City; Place Image; Vietnam; Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique","","","","","Abubakar, Binta, Tertiary education: An investigation of location selection criteria and preferences by international students - the case of two Australian universities, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 20, 1, pp. 49-68, (2010); Acharya, Alok, Place branding research: a thematic review and future research agenda, International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing, 13, 3, pp. 289-317, (2016); Ahn, Young-joo, City Residents’ Perception of MICE City Brand Orientation and Their Brand Citizenship Behavior: A Case Study of Busan, South Korea, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 21, 3, pp. 328-353, (2016); Design Management Review, (2007); Place Branding, (2006); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2015); Asseraf, Yoel, Destination branding: The role of consumer affinity, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 6, 4, pp. 375-384, (2017); Baloglu, Seyhmus, Destination Image and Brand Personality of Jamaica: A Model of Tourist Behavior, Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 31, 8, pp. 1057-1070, (2014); Berg, Per Olof, Branding Chinese mega-cities: Policies, practices and positioning, pp. 1-302, (2014); Boisen, Martin, Reframing place promotion, place marketing, and place branding - moving beyond conceptual confusion, Cities, 80, pp. 4-11, (2018)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","2515964X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135306539"

Motivated by the contrasting views in the existing literature, this paper investigates whether bank policy determines firm-level cash policy. Using Japanese firm-level data over 2000–2014, we find that the difference in bank health effects stems from the firm's investment status. We find that healthy banks induce growing firms to hold more cash while declining firms hold more cash when borrowing from unhealthy banks. Furthermore, we find that banks with more liquidity also induce their growing borrowers to have more cash. Our results are robust to the endogeneity of bank selection. Our study indicates that bank-firm relationship can serve as an advance-signalling device for a firm's shareholder-wealth-maximizing investments and contributes to the literature that explains the cash holding puzzle. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Capital; Bank Liquidity; Bank-firm Relationship; Cash Policy; Financial Constraint; Japanese Banks","","","","","Acharya, Viral V., Is cash negative debt?

We also find that access to credit is positively associated with both formal and informal firm growth, but the results for formal firms seem to be driven by some high growth firms (and rapidly shrinking firms).

Through interviews of 21 female customers in the capital city of Hanoi, two categories of customer feelings were identified: positive and negative. The reasons for or causes of these feelings were distributed across the five steps of the order and consumption process: pre-order (information and options), order (order, payment, and cancellation processes), delivery (staff attitude and waiting time), use (food quality and quantity), and post-use (complaint and complaint response). Based on these findings, theoretical implications about online food order services in particular and ecommerce in general are discussed. In addition, practical implications for restaurants, food deliverers, and app developers are proposed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Andreyeva, Tatiana, Exposure to food advertising on television: Associations with children's fast food and soft drink consumption and obesity, Economics and Human Biology, 9, 3, pp. 221-233, (2011); Ball, Dwayne A., Service personalization and loyalty, Journal of Services Marketing, 20, 6, pp. 391-403, (2006); Bawden, David, The dark side of information: Overload, anxiety and other paradoxes and pathologies, Journal of Information Science, 35, 2, pp. 180-191, (2009); Cha, Jaemin, Customers’ perceptions in value and food safety on customer satisfaction and loyalty in restaurant environments: moderating roles of gender and restaurant types, Journal of Quality Assurance in Hospitality and Tourism, 20, 2, pp. 143-161, (2019); Chandrasekhar, Natarajan, Food Delivery Services and Customer Preference: A Comparative Analysis, Journal of Foodservice Business Research, 22, 4, pp. 375-386, (2019); Chua, Bee Lia, Servicescape failure and recovery strategy in the food service industry: The effect on customer repatronization, Journal of Quality Assurance in Hospitality and Tourism, 11, 3, pp. 179-198, (2010); Correa, Juan Carlos, Evaluation of collaborative consumption of food delivery services through web mining techniques, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 46, pp. 45-50, (2019); Research Design Qualitative Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches, (2003); Dang, Anh Kim, Consumer preference and attitude regarding online food products in Hanoi, Vietnam, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 5, (2018); Qualitative Research Methods in Public Relations and Marketing Communications, (2002)","","IGI Global","","","","","","","1799849848; 9781799849858; 9781799849841","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137736821"

The primary purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting consumer trust in brands of safe vegetables. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling technique was applied to test the hypothetical relationships based on a sample of 361 consumers from a face-to-face interview in the urban areas of Hanoi city, Vietnam, in March and April 2018. Findings: The authors' findings show that both brand credibility and brand reputation positively affected brand trust. The trustworthiness of a safe vegetable system had a more important role than the competence in building brand trust. While the effects of system trustworthiness on brand trust were found directly and indirectly (through brand credibility), system competence only had an indirect influence on brand trust via brand reputation. Notably, while risk recall directly reduced brand trust, risk information caused a directly positive effect on brand trust. In addition, the impact of food hazards on brand trust was indirect through brand credibility. Practical implications: Based on our results, the Vietnamese government and stakeholders in the safe vegetable chain should improve brand trust based on fulfilling comprehensive traceability, expanding the brand reputation and providing an appropriate risk communication strategy to the public. Originality/value: This study is one of the first attempts to model and evaluate factors affecting brand trust in the food sector directly and indirectly. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand Credibility, Brand Reputation; Brand Trust; Risk Perception; Safe Vegetables; System Trustworthiness; Article; Consumer; Government; Human; Interview; Perception; Recall; Structural Equation Modeling; Trust; Urban Area; Vegetable; Viet Nam","article; consumer; government; human; interview; perception; recall; structural equation modeling; trust; urban area; vegetable; Viet Nam","","","This study was supported by QR program, Kyushu University, Japan.We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.","International Business Research, (2010); Bai, Li, Understanding the antecedents of organic food purchases: The important roles of beliefs, subjective norms, and identity expressiveness, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 11, (2019); Berg, Lisbet, Trust in food safety in Russia, Denmark and Norway, European Societies, 7, 1, pp. 103-129, (2005); Boccia, Flavio, Genetically modified food versus knowledge and fear: A Noumenic approach for consumer behaviour, Food Research International, 111, pp. 682-688, (2018); Structural Equation Modeling with Amos Basic Concepts Applications and Programming, (2010); Calvo-Porral, Cristina, Food private label brands: the role of consumer trust on loyalty and purchase intention, British Food Journal, 118, 3, pp. 679-696, (2016); Chen, Mei Fiang, Consumer trust in food safety - A multidisciplinary approach and empirical evidence from Taiwan, Risk Analysis, 28, 6, pp. 1553-1569, (2008); de Jonge, Janneke, Monitoring consumer confidence in food safety: An exploratory study, British Food Journal, 106, pp. 837-849, (2004); de Jonge, Janneke, Understanding consumer confidence in the safety of food: Its two-dimensional structure and determinants, Risk Analysis, 27, 3, pp. 729-740, (2007); de Jonge, Janneke, How trust in institutions and organizations builds general consumer confidence in the safety of food: A decomposition of effects, Appetite, 51, 2, pp. 311-317, (2008)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","0007070X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085768964"

Fluctuation of stock price in commercial banks in developing countries such as Vietnam will reflect the business health of bank system and the whole economy. Good business management requires us to consider the impacts of multi macro factors on stock price, and it contributes to promoting business plan and economic policies for economic growth and stabilizing macroeconomic factors. By data collection method through statistics, analysis, synthesis, comparison, quantitative analysis to generate qualitative comments and discussion; using econometric method to perform regression equation and evaluate quantitative results, the article analyzed and evaluated the impacts of six (6) macroeconomic factors on stock price of a joint stock commercial bank, Navibank (NVB or NCB) in Vietnam in the period of 2014-2019, both positive and negative sides. The results of quantitative research, in a seven factor model, show that the increase in GDP growth and lending rate and VNIndex has a significant effect on increasing NVB stock price with the highest impact coefficient, the second is decreasing CPI and the exchange rate.

Overall, the GMS represents a significant portion of Vietnam’s trade portfolio. China is the dominant trading partner in the GMS, exhibiting strong influence over Vietnam’s trade, especially its imports. However, using the gravity model of trade, we find that Vietnam has not benefited from GMS cooperation, as exemplified by its significant trade deficit, particularly with China. We further find that human capital enhancement and financial development are key factors to facilitate Vietnam’s trade, and mitigate its trade deficit with other GMS member countries. To this end, this study provides some important policy implications for the Vietnamese government as well as policymakers in other countries, when trading with larger partners in the context of regional economic cooperation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gravity Model; Greater Mekong Sub-region; Regional Economic Cooperation; Trade; Vietnam","","","","","Ahmed, Nasiruddin, Export response to trade liberalization in Bangladesh: A cointegration analysis, Applied Economics, 32, 8, pp. 1077-1084, (2000); American Economic Review, (1973); Anderson, James E., Gravity with gravitas: A solution to the border puzzle, American Economic Review, 93, 1, pp. 170-192, (2003); Arslan, I., Export incentives, exchange rate policy and export growth in Turkey, Review of Economics and Statistics, 75, 1, pp. 128-133, (1993); Handbook of International Economics, (1995); Gravity for Dummies and Dummies for Gravity Equations, (2006); Beck, Thorsten, Financial development and international trade: Is there a link?, Journal of International Economics, 57, 1, pp. 107-131, (2002); Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Review, (2005); Cipollina, Maria, Reciprocal trade agreements in gravity models: A meta-analysis, Review of International Economics, 18, 1, pp. 63-80, (2010); Contractor, Farok J., The influence of human capital investment on the exports of services and goods: an analysis of the top 25 services outsourcing countries, Management International Review, 48, 4, pp. 433-445, (2008)","","Center for Economic Integration cie@sejong.ac.kr","","","","","","1225651X; 19765525","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090101078"

This study applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the data collected from 392 employees working at major Vietnam's telecommunication companies. Empirical results show that knowledge sharing including knowledge donating, knowledge collecting play an important role in improving individual innovation capability. There is no direct link between knowledge collecting and organizational innovation capability, while knowledge donating has direct positive impact on product and managerial innovation. Furthermore, the individual innovation capability acts as a mediating variable between knowledge sharing practices and firm innovation capability.

Compared to previous literature, we use a broader definition of financial literacy which covers not only financial knowledge but also financial behavior and financial attitudes. We also use a new definition of financial inclusion which goes beyond the supply-side perspective to consider the consumer's perspective. To do so, we use the survey instrument designed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development International Network on Financial Education. We also used more reliable instrumental variables to investigate the effects of financial literacy on financial inclusion (and its components) and savings behavior. We find that financial literacy has statistically positive effects on both financial inclusion and savings. Moreover, the effects of financial literacy on different measures of financial inclusion vary. Our results further show that individuals with higher financial literacy scores are more likely to hold savings in both formal and informal forms than those who have lower financial literacy scores, even when we control for income and education. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cambodia; Financial Behavior; Financial Inclusion; Financial Literacy; Household Saving; Laos; Viet Nam","","","","We thank the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Bank of Lao PDR (BoL), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the Lao PDR resident mission of the Asian Development Bank for their support in carrying out this study.

The question of whether or not beta is dead has attracted great attention from academics and practitioners in the last 50 years or so, and the debate is still ongoing. Many empirical studies have been conducted to test the validity of beta within the framework of CAPM. However, it is a claim of this paper that beta at the industry level has been largely ignored in the current literature. This study is conducted to examine if beta, proxied for a systematic risk, should be considered valid in the application of the CAPM at the industry level for Australia using daily data on 2200 stocks listed on the Australian Securities Exchange from January 2007 to 31 December 2016. Various portfolio formations are utilized in this paper. General economic conditions such as interest rate, inflation, and GDP are examples of systematic risk. Findings from this study indicate that the selection of portfolio construction, estimation technique, and news about economic conditions significantly affects the view whether or not beta should be considered as a valid measure of systematic risk. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Australia; Beta; Capm; Industry; Systematic Risk","","","","Funding: This research was funded by Ho Chi Minh City Open University grant number E2019.25.3 and the APC was funded by Ho Chi Minh City Open University Acknowledgments: The authors are most grateful to three reviewers for very helpful comments and suggestions.

A review of the literature shows that tax and social security contributions, regulations, public sector services, the quality of institutions and tax compliance, play important roles in determining the degree to which firms attempt to evade taxes. Measuring tax evasion is problematic due to data requirements and inadequacies. Few tax evasion indices have been estimated but it appears that they cannot be used for international comparisons across countries. This important issue has largely been ignored in the literature, in particular for emerging markets. Consequently, this paper is conducted to develop a new tax evasion index (TEI) using the most substantial and recent data from the standardized World Bank Enterprises Survey 2006–2017. In addition, using the newly developed TEI, the paper examines the importance and contribution of information sharing and bank penetration to the degree of tax evasion in emerging markets. The paper uses a sample of 112 emerging markets from 2006–2017 and the Tobit model in estimation. The empirical findings from the paper indicate that the average TEI during the 2006– 2017 period for emerging markets is 0.62, with a range of (0.25, 0.75). In addition, we find that information sharing and bank penetration negatively affect the degree of tax evasion, as proxied by the TEI, in emerging markets. The empirical results also confirm the view that large firms are considered to have adopted good tax compliance practices, while firms located in remote areas are more likely to evade taxes. Policy implications have emerged on the basis of the empirical findings from the paper. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Penetration; Emerging Markets; Firms’ Location; Firms’ Size; Information Sharing; Tax Evasion","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors wish to thank two reviewers for very helpful comments and suggestions.

Tumor classification, however, is a typical small sample problem. In this paper, an inverse projection group sparse representation (IPGSR) model is presented for tumor classification based on constructing a low rank variation dictionary (LRVD), for short, LRVD-IPGSR model. Firstly, an IPGSR model is constructed based on making full use of existing training and test samples, and group sparsity effect of genetic data. Furthermore, from a new viewpoint, a LRVD is constructed for improving the performance of IPGSR-based tumor classification. The LRVD can be independently constructed by detecting and utilizing variations of normals and typical patients, rather than directly using and changed with the genetic data or their corresponding feature data. And the LRVD can be automatic updated and extended to fit the case of new types of diseases. Finally, the LRVD-IPGSR model is fully analyzed from feasibility, stability, optimization and convergence. The performance of the LRVD-IPGSR model-based tumor classification framework is verified on eight microarray gene expression datasets, which contain early diagnosis, tumor type recognition and postoperative metastasis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inverse Projection Group Sparse Representation; Low Rank Variation Dictionary; Microarray Gene Expression Data; Tumor Classification; Classification (of Information); Gene Expression; Inverse Problems; Tumors; Group Sparse; Group Sparsities; Inverse Projections; Microarray Gene Expression; Microarray Gene Expression Data; Sparse Representation Based Classifications; Training Sample; Tumor Classification; Computer Aided Diagnosis","Classification (of information); Gene expression; Inverse problems; Tumors; Group sparse; Group sparsities; Inverse projections; Microarray gene expression; Microarray gene expression data; Sparse representation based classifications; Training sample; Tumor classification; Computer aided diagnosis","","","The authors would like to thank https://tumorgenome.nih.gov/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS4766 for their datasets.

When USVs perform various missions in sophisticated marine environment, autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance will be necessary and essential. However, there are few effective navigation methods with real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environment. With tailored design of state and action spaces and a dueling deep Q-network, a deep reinforcement learning method ANOA (Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance) is proposed for the autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of USVs. Experimental results demonstrate that ANOA outperforms deep Q-network (DQN) and Deep Sarsa in the efficiency of exploration and the speed of convergence not only in static environment but also in dynamic environment. Furthermore, the ANOA is integrated with the real control model of a USV moving in surge, sway and yaw and it achieves a higher success rate than Recast navigation method in dynamic environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Navigation; Obstacle Avoidance; Reinforcement Learning; Unmanned Surface Vehicle (usv); Collision Avoidance; Learning Systems; Marine Navigation; Motion Planning; Reinforcement Learning; Unmanned Surface Vehicles; Autonomous Navigation; Dynamic Environments; Marine Environment; Navigation Methods; Real Time Path Planning; Reinforcement Learning Method; Speed Of Convergence; Static Environment; Deep Learning","Collision avoidance; Learning systems; Marine navigation; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Unmanned surface vehicles; Autonomous navigation; Dynamic environments; Marine environment; Navigation methods; Real time path planning; Reinforcement learning method; Speed of convergence; Static environment; Deep learning","","","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61625304 ) and by the State Key Program of National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61936001 ).","Kandath, Harikumar, Autonomous navigation and sensorless obstacle avoidance for UGV with environment information from UAV, 2018-January, pp. 266-269, (2018); Ferreira, Barbara Arbanas, Decentralized planning and control for UAV–UGV cooperative teams, Autonomous Robots, 42, 8, pp. 1601-1618, (2018); Adamski, Igor, Distributed deep reinforcement learning: Learn how to play atari games in 21 minutes, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10876 LNCS, pp. 370-388, (2018); El-Sallab, Ahmad A.Al, Deep reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving, IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology, pp. 70-76, (2017); End to End Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assist, (2016); Sharma, Hrishikesh, An efficient backtracking-based approach to turn-constrained path planning for aerial mobile robots, (2017); Guo, Qing, Path-planning of automated guided vehicle based on improved Dijkstra algorithm, pp. 7138-7143, (2017); undefined, (2018); Pérez-Carabaza, Sara, A Multi-UAV minimum time search planner based on ACOR, pp. 35-42, (2017); Phung, Manh Duong, Enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization path planning for UAV vision-based surface inspection, Automation in Construction, 81, pp. 25-33, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082456293"

An observation of the behavior of three-dimensional (3D) molten metal flow inside weld pool during welding was carried out with the support of an advanced X-ray observation system. The results showed that the metal flow in pure Ar shielding gas case was in upward direction from bottom surface toward top surface of weld pool behind the keyhole. Meanwhile, the molten metal flow in Ar shielding gas mixed with 0.5 % O<inf>2</inf> case was in downward direction from top surface toward bottom surface. The variation of convection flow inside weld pool as described above is a result of the variation of keyhole diameter and inclination angle of keyhole wall (keyhole profile) with (1) large around the top surface but narrow around the bottom surface in case of pure Ar and (2) narrow around the top surface but large around the bottom surface in case of Ar mixed with 0.5 % O<inf>2</inf>, which affect the direction and magnitude of shear force acting on weld pool surface. Consequently, only the very slight increase of oxygen content in argon shielding gas due to lowering of shielding effect is found to significantly affect material and heat transport process in PKAW. The results also imply that when argon shielding gas with small amount of oxygen is used, deep and narrow weld penetration is more easily obtained similarly with AA-TIG welding process. However, its mechanism is suggested to be mainly related to the change in shear force due to keyhole shape deformation by the decrease of the surface tension rather than the change in direction and magnitude of Marangoni force. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convection Flow; Deep Penetration; Keyhole Profile; Plasma Keyhole Arc Welding; Shear Force; X-ray Observation; Argon; Electric Arc Welding; Gas Welding; Gases; Heat Convection; Laser Beam Welding; Liquid Metals; Metals; Oxygen; Shielding; Welds; X Rays; Convection Flow; Deep Penetration; Keyhole Profile; Shear Force; X-ray Observations; Shear Flow","Argon; Electric arc welding; Gas welding; Gases; Heat convection; Laser beam welding; Liquid metals; Metals; Oxygen; Shielding; Welds; X rays; Convection flow; Deep penetration; Keyhole profile; Shear force; X-ray observations; Shear flow","","","","Tomsic, Michael J., ENERGY DISTRIBUTION IN KEYHOLE MODE PLASMA ARC WELDS., Welding Journal, 53, 3, (1974); Physics of Welding, (1986); Martikainen, Jukka K., Conditions for achieving high-quality welds in the plasma-arc keyhole welding of structural steels, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 52, 1, pp. 68-75, (1995); Welding Journal, (1991); Irving, Bob, Why aren't airplanes welded?, Welding Journal, 76, 1, pp. 31-41, (1997); Welding Journal, (1992); Liu, Zuming, Keyhole behaviors influence weld defects in plasma arc welding process, Welding Journal, 94, 9, pp. 281-290, (2015); Welding Journal, (1991); Tanaka, Manabu, Predictions of weld pool profiles using plasma physics, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 40, 1, pp. R1-R23, (2007); Zhang, Guokai, Experimental observation of both keyhole and its surrounding thermal field in plasma arc welding, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 70, pp. 439-448, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15266125","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082755985"

This study aimed to explore the dynamics of responses to the restriction of nonylphenol (NP) and its ethoxylates (NPEOs) among the Vietnamese textile manufacturers from the perspectives of attitude and the perceptions of adaptabilities, risks, benefits, and barriers. The chemicals are used as surfactants and are known to be responsible for endocrine disrupting effects. In-depth interviews were conducted with technical specialists from four textile firms and one chemical supplier. Regulatory and market situations with regards to the chemicals were also assessed. The findings revealed varied responses to chemical elimination where perceived technical risk, financial risk, benefits, and barriers played different roles in driving a certain action. The attitude towards chemical restriction was shaped by the trade-off between perceptions of financial risk and benefits and was moderated by market strategy. Efforts, such as enhanced washing or reductions in the dose of NP/NPEOs, imply the potency of continuous discharge of these chemicals into the environment, suggesting critical investigations on NP/NPEOs removal to prioritize actions for balancing between economic growth and environmental protection. Poor access to new policies and technological and chemical innovations was the most important barrier among private firms, highlighting the roles of non-governmental textile and garment industrial/trade associations in enhancing their members’ informative capacity. The study reflects the significance of incorporation of firm behavior research into environmental risk management practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benefit Perception; Decision-making; Organizational Adaptation; Risk Perception; Technical Adaptation; Behavioral Research; Decision Making; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Endocrine Disrupters; Environmental Management; Health Risks; Risk Management; Surface Active Agents; Textile Industry; Textiles; Chemical Innovations; Chemical Suppliers; Environmental Risk Managements; In-depth Interviews; Market Strategies; Organizational Adaptation; Technical Adaptation; Technical Specialists; Risk Perception","Behavioral research; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental management; Health risks; Risk management; Surface active agents; Textile industry; Textiles; Chemical innovations; Chemical suppliers; Environmental risk managements; In-depth interviews; Market strategies; Organizational adaptation; technical adaptation; Technical specialists; Risk perception","","","This study was financially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (project no. 16H02356).

Drawing on matched employer–employee data from 387 organizations and 7187 employees in 14 countries, our findings show a positive relationship between HRM practices combined in High-Performance Work Systems (HPWS) and organizational performance across societal cultures. Three dimensions of societal culture assessed (power distance, in-group collectivism, and institutional collectivism) did not moderate this relationship. Drawing on the Ability–Motivation–Opportunity (AMO) model, we further consider the effectiveness of three bundles of HRM practices (skill-enhancing, motivation-enhancing, and opportunity-enhancing practices). This analysis shows opportunity-enhancing practices (e.g., participative work design and decision-making) are less effective in high-power-distance cultures. Nevertheless, in markedly different countries we find combinations of complementary HPWS and bundles of AMO practices appear to outweigh the influence of societal culture and enhance organizational performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-cultural Management; High-performance Work Systems; Organizational Performance; Societal Culture","","","","This research study is funded by two Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Grant (Grant Numbers PDG-890-2010-0043; IOF-861-2007-3002).

Specifically, the authors address previous calls in the literature for stressing the soft aspects of TQM and for drawing a critical success factor (CSF) list that is formulated on the basis of empirical research instead of theory. Design/methodology/approach: This is a comparative qualitative case study of three manufacturing SMEs combining empirical data from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a large variety of stakeholders – from top managers to shop-floor workers, site visits and observations. Findings: The study identifies 12 soft CSFs, and while most of these factors have been well-documented in the literature (e.g. top management involvement and leadership), the authors show evidence for the existence of other soft constructs that have not been considered or have been given little importance previously (i.e. middle management involvement and support, reward and recognition, CSR focus). Research limitations/implications: The study fills two major gaps in the (T)QM literature. First, it enriches the understanding of TQM implementation among Japanese SMEs. Second, it addresses the importance of soft TQM as part of the TQM implementation process. Practical implications: This paper provides company owners and managers with valuable knowledge that may assist their organisations in the pursuit of business excellence including higher product quality and employee satisfaction. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first (international) study to investigate TQM implementation within the context of Japanese SMEs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Critical Success Factors; Japan; Small-to-medium-sized Enterprises; Total Quality Management","","","","","Ahire, Sanjay L., Quality management in large vs small firms: An emperical investigation, Journal of Small Business Management, 34, 2, pp. 1-13, (1996); Ahire, Sanjay L., Development and validation of TQM implementation constructs, Decision Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 23-56, (1996); Ahmad, Md Fauzi, Comparative study of TQM practices between Japanese and non- Japanese companies: Proposed conceptual framework, Advanced Materials Research, 903, pp. 371-377, (2014); TQM Theoretical Insights, (2005); Critical Factors of TQM an International Comparative Benchmarking Analysis, (2004); Aquilani, Barbara, A systematic literature review on total quality management critical success factors and the identification of new avenues of research, TQM Journal, 29, 1, pp. 184-213, (2017); Arunachalam, Thiruchelvi, Does the soft aspects of TQM influence job satisfaction and commitment?

Uday, Research Organization of Information and Systems National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan","High Utility Pattern Mining is a popular task for analyzing data. It consists of discovering patterns having a high importance in databases. A popular application of high utility pattern mining is to identify high utility (profitable) patterns in customer transaction data. Though such analysis can be useful to understand data, it does not consider the cost (e.g. effort, resources, money or time) required for obtaining the utility (benefits). In this paper, we argue that to discover interesting patterns in event sequences, it is useful to consider both a utility model and a cost model. For example, to identify cost-effective ways of treating patients from medical pathways data, it is desirable to consider not only the ability of treatments to inhibit symptoms or cure a disease (utility) but also the resources consumed and the time spent (cost) to provide these treatments. Based on this perspective, this paper defines a novel task of discovering Cost-Effective Event Sequences in event logs. In this task, cost is modeled as numeric values, while utility is represented either as binary or numeric values. Measures are proposed to evaluate the trade-off and correlation between cost and utility of patterns to identify cost-effective patterns (patterns having a low cost but providing a high utility). Three efficient algorithms called CEPB, corCEPB and CEPN are designed to extract these patterns. They rely on a tight lower-bound on the cost and a memory buffering technique to find patterns efficiently. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms achieve high efficiency, that proposed optimizations improve efficiency, and that insightful cost-effective patterns are found in real-life e-learning data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cost; Cost-effective Patterns; Event Logs; Pattern Mining; Sequences; Sequential Patterns; Utility; Cost Effectiveness; Costs; Data Mining; Economic And Social Effects; Efficiency; Real Time Systems; Cost Effective; Event Logs; Pattern Mining; Sequences; Sequential Patterns; Utility; Cost Benefit Analysis","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Real time systems; Cost effective; Event logs; Pattern mining; Sequences; Sequential patterns; Utility; Cost benefit analysis","","","","Han, Jiawei, Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation: A frequent-pattern tree approach, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 8, 1, pp. 53-87, (2004); Fournier-Viger, Philippe, A survey of itemset mining, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 7, 4, (2017); Data Science and Pattern Recognition, (2017); Agrawal, Rakesh, Mining sequential patterns, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 3-14, (1995); Srikant, Ramakrishnan, Mining sequential patterns: Generalizations and performance improvements, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1057 LNCS, pp. 3-17, (1996); Zaki, Mohammed Javeed J., SPADE: An efficient algorithm for mining frequent sequences, Machine Learning, 42, 1-2, pp. 31-60, (2001); Han, Jiawei, FreeSpan: Frequent pattern-projected sequential pattern mining, pp. 355-359, (2000); Pei, Jian, Mining sequential patterns by pattern-growth: The prefixspan approach, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 16, 11, pp. 1424-1440, (2004); Fournier-Viger, Philippe, Fast vertical mining of sequential patterns using co-occurrence information, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8443 LNAI, PART 1, pp. 40-52, (2014); Fournier-Viger, Philippe, VMSP: Efficient vertical mining of maximal sequential patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8436 LNAI, pp. 83-94, (2014)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076540415"

The existing AHP frameworks developed to manage individual consistency and group consensus have been widely investigated. However, in these frameworks, the consistency is often destroyed in the consensus reaching process, which means that the revised decision makers’ judgments have little relationship to Saaty's original 1/9-9 evaluation scale. This paper outlines a new approach to aid the consensus decision making process, for which two heuristic algorithms are developed. The first algorithm is designed to assist the decision maker in achieving a predefined consistency level, and the second is designed to achieve consensus while controlling the individual consistency level. Several classical numerical examples are compared to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, some simulations are conducted to further demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for general cases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consensus; Consistency; Group Decision Making; Multiplicative Preference Relation; Simulation Analysis; Heuristic Algorithms; Heuristic Methods; Hierarchical Systems; Consensus; Consistency; Group Decision Making; Multiplicative Preference Relations; Simulation Analysis; Decision Making","Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Hierarchical systems; Consensus; Consistency; Group Decision Making; Multiplicative preference relations; Simulation analysis; Decision making","","","The authors are grateful to the editors and anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments which have lead to an improved version of this paper.

Vietnam hotel, entertainment, airline & tourism industries are growing fast and contributing much to the economic development and have been affected by inflation. This paper measures the volatility of market risk in Viet Nam Hotel, entertainment, airline & tourism industries after this low inflation environment (2015-2017). The main reason is the necessary role of these financial companies and their system in Vietnam in the economic development and growth in recent years always go with risk potential and risk control policies. This research paper aims to figure out how much increase or decrease in the market risk of Vietnam Hotel, entertainment, airline & tourism firms during the post-low inflation environment 2015-2017. First, by using quantitative combined with comparative data analysis method, we find out the risk level measured by equity beta mean values in the Hotel, entertainment, airline & tourism industries are acceptable, as they are lower than (<) 1. Then, one of its major findings is the comparison between risk level of hotel industry during the post-low inflation period 2015-2017 compared to those in the airline & tourism industries. In fact, the research findings show us market risk level of entertainment industry, one kind of financial risks, is the highest among 3 groups. Whereas risk fluctuation in airline & tourism industry is the highest. Finally, this paper provides some ideas that could provide companies and government more evidence in establishing their policies in governance. This is the complex task but the research results shows us warning that the market risk need to be controlled better during the post-low inflation period 2015-2017.

Several, literature works use cameras to record emotions. However, these approaches may not be effective in everyday life, due to camera obstructions and different types of stimulation, which can be related also with the interaction with other human beings. Therefore, in this work, it is investigated the electrocardiogram, the electrodermal activity, and the electric brain activity physiological signals as main informative channels. The aforementioned signals have been acquired through the use of a wireless wearable sensor network. An experimental methodology was proposed to induce three different emotional states by means of social interaction. Two different combinations of sensors were analyzed using three different time-window frames (180s, 150s, and 120s) and classified with three unsupervised machine learning approaches (K-Means, K-medoids and Self-organizing maps). Finally, their classification performances were compared to the ones obtained by four commonly used supervised techniques (i.e. Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and k-nearest neighbor) to discuss the optimal combination of sensors, time-window length, and unsupervised classifier. Fifteen healthy young participants were recruited in the study and more than 100 instances were analyzed.

The system is developed on the basis of material and energy exchange potentials between the wastewater and exhaust gas flows, and the use of available firewood ash as material for absorption. Two operation modes were presented aiming at a complete treatment of wastewater and exhaust gases as required by the Vietnamese national standards, and the recovery of valuable components in the system (N, P) for obtaining value-added products (such as fertilizer, irrigation water, etc.). In addition, the maximization of potentials on existing natural conditions at the local family, the avoidance of chemicals used in the system etc. have also helped to lower the investment and operation costs of the treatment facilities. The application of this system also contributes to the “greening” of the rice production chain in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam and is an example for a local closed cycle economy. Several public activities have also been conducted at the demonstration site (at the local family) with the purpose of maintaining and multiplying the system's effectiveness among the local public community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cleaner Production; Closed Cycle Economy; Integrated Ecosystem; Livestock; Pollution Prevention; Rice-paper Production Chain; Economics; Exhaust Gases; Investments; Irrigation; Papermaking; River Pollution; Surface Waters; Wastewater Treatment; Water Craft; Cleaner Production; Closed Cycle; Livestock; Paper Production; Pollution Prevention; Pollution Control; Animals; Pollution Control; Production; Rivers; Systems; Vietnam; Water Pollution","Economics; Exhaust gases; Investments; Irrigation; Papermaking; River pollution; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Water craft; Cleaner production; Closed cycle; Livestock; Paper production; Pollution prevention; Pollution control; Animals; Pollution Control; Production; Rivers; Systems; Vietnam; Water Pollution","","","Funding text 1: Authors sincerely thank the Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City for the financial support of this research (grant number B2018-24-01), and the AseaUninet for collaboration with IPPE, TU Graz, Austria, to implement this study.; Funding text 2: Authors sincerely thank the Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City for the financial support of this research (grant number B2018-24-01 ), and the AseaUninet for collaboration with IPPE, TU Graz, Austria, to implement this study.","Bell, Lindsay W., Evolution in crop-livestock integration systems that improve farm productivity and environmental performance in Australia, European Journal of Agronomy, 57, pp. 10-20, (2014); Bonmatí Blasi, August, Air stripping of ammonia from pig slurry: Characterisation and feasibility as a pre- or post-treatment to mesophilic anaerobic digestion, Waste Management, 23, 3, pp. 261-272, (2003); Boydak, Özlem, Thermodynamic investigation of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) energy recovery system and recent studies, Thermal Science, 2018, pp. 2679-2690, (2018); Engle, Carole Ruth, Optimal Product Mix for Integrated Livestock‐Fish Culture Systems on Limited Resource Farms, Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 18, 3, pp. 137-147, (1987); Fernandez-Delgado Juarez, Marina, Co-composting of biowaste and wood ash, influence on a microbially driven-process, Waste Management, 46, pp. 155-164, (2015); Fontenot, Quenton C., Effects of temperature, salinity, and carbon: nitrogen ratio on sequencing batch reactor treating shrimp aquaculture wastewater, Bioresource Technology, 98, 9, pp. 1700-1703, (2007); Guo, Jianhua, Short- and long-term effects of temperature on partial nitrification in a sequencing batch reactor treating domestic wastewater, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 179, 1-3, pp. 471-479, (2010); undefined, (2018); Hai, Lethanh, An integrated eco-model of agriculture and small-scale industry in craft villages toward cleaner production and sustainable development in rural areas – A case study from Mekong delta of Viet Nam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 137, pp. 274-282, (2016); Harrison, Roland, A review of the effect of N fertilizer type on gaseous emissions, Advances in Agronomy, 73, pp. 65-108, (2001)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074685736"

We analyze two reversed sentiment indicators, namely Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and Volatility Index (VIX), in two conversing situations: low and high sentiment. The empirical evidence suggests that sentiment has a significant link with concurrent returns, but its influence seems to wipe out quickly as the little to no return predictability is detected. More importantly, we find that “investor fear gauge” (VIX) generates a more significant contemporaneous effect on market returns than investor confidence. The impact on future returns, on the contrary, is inconclusive since low CCI and VIX dominate the opposite ones most of the time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Confidence Index; Investor Sentiment; Stock Returns; Volatility Index","","","","","Journal of Physical Sciences and Environmental Safety, (2012); Anusakumar, Shangkari V., The effect of investor sentiment on stock returns: Insight from emerging Asian markets, Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, 13, 1, pp. 159-178, (2017); Baker, Malcolm P., Market liquidity as a sentiment indicator, Journal of Financial Markets, 7, 3, pp. 271-299, (2004); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns, Journal of Finance, 61, 4, pp. 1645-1680, (2006); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment in the stock market, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, 2, pp. 129-151, (2007); Baker, Malcolm P., Global, local, and contagious investor sentiment, Journal of Financial Economics, 104, 2, pp. 272-287, (2012); Bathia, Deven, An examination of investor sentiment effect on G7 stock market returns, European Journal of Finance, 19, 9, pp. 909-937, (2013); Bekaert, Geert, The VIX, the variance premium and stock market volatility, Journal of Econometrics, 183, 2, pp. 181-192, (2014); Brown, Gregory W., Investor sentiment and the near-term stock market, Journal of Empirical Finance, 11, 1, pp. 1-27, (2004); Brown, Gregory W., Investor sentiment and asset valuation, Journal of Business, 78, 2, pp. 405-440, (2005)","","Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi","","","","","","25011960; 25013165","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198725374"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies fixed effects and dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) models to examine hypothesized associations between the proportion of nonexecutive directors and stock return volatility, as well as the moderating effect of capital expenditure. The robustness tests are implemented by applying alternative measures of overinvestment and firm risk. Findings: The results show that the presence of nonexecutive directors on board increases firm risk. However, the combination of nonexecutive ratio and capital expenditure ratio has a significant negative impact on firm risk. The result is also confirmed by the difference between the monitoring role of nonexecutive directors in overinvesting and underinvesting firms. Research limitations/implications: The results imply that Vietnamese listed firms take stock return volatility into consideration before nominating and appointing nonexecutive directors into their board, especially in overinvesting firms.

However, the coconut jelly production has resulted in significant environmental impacts, particularly to the aquatic environment due to its heavily polluted wastewater e.g. very high values of COD (up to 120,000 mg/1), of total nitrogen (up to 1,740 mg/1), and of total phosphorus (up to 64 mg/1). The available wastewater treatment technology for such type of wastewater is likely to be not economically efficient due to the small-scale production at craft villages in the developing countries. This study developed and demonstrated an integrated eco-model for small (family) scale production of raw coconut jelly in craft villages which applied Cleaner Production sollutions for pollution prevention on the basis of available conditions at the local family. The system demonstration showed a win-win solution for family with major benefits by reduction of 90% of pollutants (i.e 27 kg COD, 21.4 kg BOD5, approx. 7 kg N, 113 g P and 28 kg SO<inf>4</inf>2- for one production batch), as well as the other benefit by major reduction of 90 % of investment and operating costs of the wastewater treatment plant. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial Cellulose; Cleaner Production; Ecosystem; Integrated Pollution Reduction; Nata De Coco","","","","This research was funded by the Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under the grant number KHCN-TNB/14-19/C25.

First, we seek to establish whether Japan’s focus on quality manufacturing was a conscious choice. Second, we attempt to analyse the impact of the external environment on the success/failure of quality upgrading. Third, we investigate whether Japanese businesses, regardless of the shifts in the competitive environment in the last two decades, continue to explore quality management as a strategic weapon for competitiveness. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study is based on a systematic literature review using two of the main scientific databases - JSTOR and Emerald. The scientific papers used for this synthesis - over sixty manuscripts in total - have (predominantly) focused on the quality movement in Japan at a national/country level. These are peerreviewed articles published between 1980 and 2018 that go beyond the field of operations/quality management. Research findings: We show that Japan’s focus on quality upgrading was a conscious choice that sought to elevate the country’s economy. Moreover, we identify a number of external factors (e.g. government support, sound formal institutions) - four, specifically - that, according to our analysis, have been critical to Japan’s success in quality manufacturing. Finally, we show that regardless of the (recent) shifts in the competitive environment, (product) quality improvement continues to take a central part in Japan’s pursuit of global economic dominance. Theoretical contribution/Originality: We claim that that this is the first comprehensive study of Japan’s quality movement to include scientific data from the Meiji Period until the present day (so far the bulk of the scientific papers have focused on the quality movement in post-war Japan). We also bridge a substantial gap in the QM literature regarding the influence of the external environment (e.g. political factors, social factors) on the success/failure in quality upgrading. Practitioner/Policy implication: The insights of this paper provide a valuable lesson to policy makers from developing and/or underdeveloped economies in their pursuit of economic growth. The study is also important to manufacturers from developing and/ or underdeveloped countries to understand their own quality management practices in comparison with those in Japan, which have the highest standards of manufacturing quality. Research limitation/Implication: Our literature search is admittedly not exhaustive as it involves only two of the main scientific databases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Growth; Japan; Quality; Quality Management; Quality Movement","","","","Funding text 1: The post-war legacy of the Japanese government to support manufacturing continued with a number of organisations trying to boost productivity further. For example, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) established an international project called Intelligent Manufacturing System (IMS), which aimed at integrating production facilities including robots and skillful human capital. At the same time, the government retained controlled of the industrial activity – in 1985, over 40 per cent of the industry was regulated by the government, with some sectors including mining, construction, and insurance being almost 100 per cent regulated (Hitomi, 1992). Besides the support from formal institutions, the Japanese government offered backing through other means including financial intervening. For instance, according to Smith (1993), between 1985 and 1989, the Finance Ministry deliberately inflated the property and securities market to offset the increasing value of the Japanese yen against the US dollar, which started hurting exports. This move sought to maintain the provision of bank funds for Japanese businesses.; Funding text 2: Japan).

This model also creates a real-time communication pattern, which can permit the designed components to be customizable and reusable in new application developments of different AUV types. The paper brings out stepwise adapted AUV dynamics for control that are then combined with the specialization of MDA/MBSE features as follows: the computation independent model (CIM) is defined by the specification of the use-case model together with hybrid automata to gather the requirement analysis for control; the platform-independent model (PIM) is then designed by specializing the real-time UML/SysML's features including main control capsules that depict structures and behaviors of controllers in detail; and the detailed PIM is subsequently converted into the platform-specific model (PSM) by object-oriented platforms to rapidly implement the AUV controller.

I employ labour quality assessments of firms as a proxy for human capital and divide human capital accumulation into the following two processes: an educational process and a process through which educational outcomes and worker training transform into labour quality. The estimation results have some notable implications for the Vietnamese context. Corruption has both negative and positive effects on human capital. On the one hand, corruption reduces the positive effect of local government spending on educational achievements and worsens labour quality. On the other hand, the prevalence of corruption in provinces/cities increases the advantages of local schools in the competition to obtain funds from the central government; hence, corruption enhances educational achievements in those regions.

It also examines whether supply and product complexity moderates the impact of internal and external process connectivity on supply chain agility. The study relies on the questionnaire survey to collect the data. Using electronic survey, the respondents working in manager' positions in Thailand's manufacturing companies are targeted. Out of 250 survey questionnaires, only 173 responses were found usable with a rate of response of 57.2%. The study focuses on Thai firms because Thai manufacturing sector is one of the strongest players in the globe. The reason to select manufacturing firms is that the manufacturing firms are considered to be very crucial in global supply chains in terms of providing agility and responsiveness while delivering final products to the consumers. Supply chain agility (SCAG) is used as dependent while internal process connectivity (INPC) and external process connectivity (EXPC) are used as independent variables. Moreover, product complexity (PRCX) and supply complexity (SPCX) are used as moderating variables. Findings show that SPCX has negatively significant influence on SCAG while PRCX has insignificant effect on SCAG. INPC and EXPC have positive and significant impact on SCAG. The results state that both INPC and EXPC play vital role in attaining SCAG. The interaction effect of product term (INPC x EXPC) on SCAG is also found to be positively significant. These outcomes are in line with the process theory which states that both INPC and EXPC are significant factor that play important role in attaining SCAG.

Environmental problems caused by industrial wastes have been becoming serious issues in developing countries. Hence, recycling industrial wastes, in order to create more renewable and clean energy, has been recognized as one of ways to reduce adverse impact of global warming and negative effect of greenhouse gases. According to statistics, Viet Nam discharges about 400,000 tons of waste tires annually and this number in the US is estimated about 4,200,000 tons per year (source: vnu.edu.vn). This creates many environmental issues. Hence, this paper aims to propose a business model to solve problems mentioned below in the paper. Building a tire shredding plant in California, USA (for example) to cut the whole tires into small shredded tires then export to developing countries like Vietnam is one method to convert wastes into clean energy and protecting our environment. This is one main objective of this research paper. Another purpose of this study is to find out a financial model to evaluate socio-economic values of renewable energy projects that help to protect our environment, as well as a modern viewpoint of not including or adding (+) new debt issuances to increase net cash flow when estimating FCFE cash flow. Using pyrolysis technology to crack carbon linkage into smaller linkages, and then convert waste tires into renewable energy (FO-R oil, carbon black and steel). This is an application of chemical engineering. Through the economic and technical analysis of this model, we can see the practical benefits of the energy project in terms of economic efficiency, profitability, which bring surplus value for investors, effective solutions for customers and a quality energy product for the society. And it also suggest the relevant government of developing countries to consider proper policies to encourage environment protection and businesses in the field of converting industrial wastes such as tires into clean energy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Model; Clean Renewable Energy; Developing Countries; Pyrolysis Technology; Shredder","","","","","Alsaleh, Ali, Waste Tire Pyrolysis: Influential Parameters and Product Properties, Current Sustainable/Renewable Energy Reports, 1, 4, pp. 129-135, (2014); International Journal of Waste Resources, (2018); Han, Jun, Pyrolysis characteristic and mechanism of waste tyre: A thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry analysis, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 129, pp. 1-5, (2018); Ijest, (2012); Intech Open, (2012); Journal of Renewable Energy, (2012); Özcan, Hüseyin Kurtuluş, An experimental study of recoverable products from waste tire pyrolysis, Global Nest Journal, 18, 3, pp. 582-590, (2016); Int J Mater Sci Appl, (2014); Roy, Christian, Vacuum pyrolysis of used tires end-uses for oil and carbon black products, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 51, 1, pp. 201-221, (1999); Wey, Ming Yen, The autothermal pyrolysis of waste tires, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 45, 11, pp. 855-863, (1995)","","World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society","","","","","","11099526; 22242899","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083875949"

It can handle a special type of attributes with preference-ordered domains by a dominance relation. This article mainly focuses on employing the DRSA to process composite ordered decision systems including categorical, numerical, set-valued, interval-valued and missing attributes, and dynamic maintenance of the lower and upper approximations under the attribute generalization. Firstly, we introduce a new composite dominance-based rough set model in which the composite dominance relation may not satisfy three basic properties, i.e., reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity. Based on the proposed relation, we redefine the lower and upper approximations of upward and downward unions of decision classes. Then, we present matrix-based methods for calculating approximations through introducing the dominant (dominated) matrix and other induced matrices. In addition, we put forward the matrix-based incremental approaches for the update of approximations in composite ordered decision systems while the attribute set varies with time, which can avoid reconstructing these matrices from scratch. Finally, according to a series of comparative experimental results, it can easily be observed that our proposed incremental updating methods have a great advantage in improving the computational performance for dynamic attribute generalization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attribute Generalization; Composite Ordered Rough Set Model; Incremental Learning; Matrix Representation; Data Handling; Attribute Generalizations; Dominance Rough Set Approaches; Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (drsa); Incremental Learning; Lower And Upper Approximations; Matrix Representation; Multi-criteria Classification; Rough Set Models; Rough Set Theory","Data handling; Attribute generalizations; Dominance rough set approaches; Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA); Incremental learning; Lower and upper approximations; Matrix representation; Multi-criteria classification; Rough set models; Rough set theory","","","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61573292 , 61572406 , 61603313 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (No. 220710004005040177 ).","Pawlak, Zdzislaw X., Rough sets, International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences, 11, 5, pp. 341-356, (1982); Rough Sets Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Data, (1991); Pawlak, Zdzislaw X., Rudiments of rough sets, Information Sciences, 177, 1, pp. 3-27, (2007); Pawlak, Zdzislaw X., Rough set theory and its applications to data analysis, Cybernetics and Systems, 29, 7, pp. 661-688, (1998); Journal of Software, (1999); Eskandari, Sadegh, Online streaming feature selection using rough sets, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 69, pp. 35-57, (2016); Dy, Jennifer G., Feature selection for unsupervised learning, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, pp. 845-889, (2004); Fakih, Saif J., LEAD: A methodology for learning efficient approaches to medical diagnosis, IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, 10, 2, pp. 220-228, (2006); Wu, Jian, A social network analysis trust-consensus based approach to group decision-making problems with interval-valued fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, Knowledge-Based Systems, 59, pp. 97-107, (2014); Hu, Qinghua, Neighborhood classifiers, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 866-876, (2008)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068754098"

This paper considers the financial distress of listed firms at the industry level in Vietnam over the last decade. Two periods are considered, namely during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (2007–2009) and post-GFC (2010–2017). The logit regression technique is used to estimate alternative models based on accounting and market factors. The paper also extends the analysis to include selected macroeconomic factors that are expected to affect the corporate financial distress of listed firms at the industry level in Vietnam. The empirical findings confirm that the corporate financial distress prediction model, which includes accounting factors with macroeconomic indicators, performs much better than alternative models.

According to our findings, the effect of financial integration on financial development significantly changes across different financial inflows. When using external debt as a proxy for financial openness, there exists a robust significant inverted U-shaped relationship between financial integration and financial development. The empirical findings also suggest that the financial integration-development nexus is contingent on the level of trade openness, national income, and institutional quality.

The City of Kitakyushu, Japan has actively implemented eco-friendly policies since 1967 and recently inspired the pursuit of sustainable development around the world, especially in the Global South region. However, empirical studies on the effects of green growth policies are still lacking. This study explores the relationship between road infrastructure development and average industrial firm size with air pollution in the city through the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Non-linear Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) methods were applied on nearly 50-years’ time series data, from 1967 to 2015. The results show that the shape of the EKC of industrial growth, measured by average firm size, depends on the type of air pollution: inverted N-shaped relationships with NO<inf>2</inf> and CO, and the U-shaped relationships with falling dust particle and O<inf>x</inf>. Regarding infrastructure development, on the one hand, our analysis shows a positive effect of road construction on alleviating the amount of falling dust and CO concentration. On the other hand, the emissions of NO<inf>2</inf> and O<inf>x</inf> are shown to rise when plotted against road construction. The decline of CO emission, when plotted against both industrial growth and road development, indicates that the ruthlessness of the local government in pursuing green growth policies has been effective in this case. However, the story is not straightforward when it comes to other air pollutants, which hints at the limits of the current policies. The case of Kitakyushu illustrates the complex dynamics of the interaction among policy, industry, infrastructure, and air pollution. It can serve as an important reference point for other cities in the Global South when policies are formed, and progress is measured in the pursuit of a green economy. Finally, as an OECD SDGs pilot city and the leading Asian green-growth city, policymakers in Kitakyushu city are recommended to revise the data policy to enhance the findability and interoperability of data, as well as to invest in the application of big data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abokyi, Eric, Industrial growth and emissions of CO2 in Ghana: The role of financial development and fossil fuel consumption, Energy Reports, 5, pp. 1339-1353, (2019); Ahmad, Najid, Modelling the CO2 emissions and economic growth in Croatia: Is there any environmental Kuznets curve?, Energy, 123, pp. 164-172, (2017); Akbostancı, Elif, The relationship between income and environment in Turkey: Is there an environmental Kuznets curve?, Energy Policy, 37, 3, pp. 861-867, (2009); Ali, Wajahat, Re-visiting the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for Malaysia: Fresh evidence from ARDL bounds testing approach, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 77, pp. 990-1000, (2017); Andreoni, James, The simple analytics of the environmental Kuznets curve, Journal of Public Economics, 80, 2, pp. 269-286, (2001); Anenberg, Susan Casper, Estimates of the global burden of ambient PM2:5, ozone, and NO2 on asthma incidence and emergency room visits, Environmental Health Perspectives, 126, 10, (2018); Banerjee, Anindya, Error-correction mechanism tests for cointegration in a single-equation framework, Journal of Time Series Analysis, 19, 3, pp. 267-283, (1998); Barnes, Paul W., Ozone depletion, ultraviolet radiation, climate change and prospects for a sustainable future, Nature Sustainability, 2, 7, pp. 569-579, (2019); Saqib, Abdul, The renewable energy, growth and environmental Kuznets curve in Turkey: An ARDL approach, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 52, pp. 587-595, (2015); Society 5 0, (2020)","","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

The focus of the empirical analysis is on the energy sector, which has been designated as one of the four key industries, together with services, food, and telecommunications, targeted for economic development by the Vietnam Government through to 2020. The oil and gas industry is a separate energy-related major industry, and it is evaluated separately from energy. The data set is from 2009 to 2017, which is decomposed into two distinct sub-periods after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), namely the immediate post-GFC (2009–2011) period and the normal (2012–2017) period, in order to identify the behavior of market risk for Vietnam’s major industries. For the stock market in Vietnam, the website used in this paper provided complete and detailed data for each stock, as classified by industry. Two widely used approaches to measure and analyze risk are used in the empirical analysis, namely Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). The empirical findings indicate that Energy and Pharmaceuticals are the least risky industries, whereas oil and gas and securities have the greatest risk. In general, there is strong empirical evidence that the four key industries display relatively low risk. For public policy, the Vietnam Government’s proactive emphasis on the targeted industries, including energy, to achieve sustainable economic growth and national economic development, seems to be working effectively. This paper presents striking empirical evidence that Vietnam’s industries have substantially improved their economic performance over the full sample, moving from relatively higher levels of market risk in the immediate post-GFC period to a lower risk environment in a normal period several years after the end of the calamitous GFC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conditional Value-at-risk; Economic Development; Energy; Industries; Market Risk; Sustainable Growth; Value-at-risk; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research received no external funding.

Thus, this study considered a case of shrimp farmers in Vietnam to identify whether the farmers’ networks have positive effects on diffusing accurate agricultural information to the treated farmers and their neighbors. To explore the effects, we invited farmers selected using network-based targeting to a workshop held in December 2017 and estimated it using data obtained before and after the treatment. We found that: 1) the targeting has a positive effect on the treated farmers’ knowledge level about a good aquaculture practice; 2) The treated farmers selected using the network-based targeting share information with more neighbors when they get new information; and 3) The targeting has a positive spillover effect on untreated farmers' knowledge level, but its effect is lower than other randomly selected. These findings can conclude that network-based targeting appears to be a method to disseminate information to many people. Nevertheless, the methods are less likely to deliver accurate information to a wider group of farmers than random sampling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Better Management Practices; Betweenness Centrality; Network-based Targeting; Shrimp Farming; Simple Random Sampling; Systematic Unaligned Random Sampling; Best Management Practice; Farmers Knowledge; Sampling; Shrimp Culture; Social Network; Spillover Effect; Technology Adoption; Technology Transfer; Viet Nam; Decapoda (crustacea)","best management practice; farmers knowledge; sampling; shrimp culture; social network; spillover effect; technology adoption; technology transfer; Viet Nam; Decapoda (Crustacea)","","","Financial supports from the JSPS Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Research Fellow Grant Numbers JP17J08994, Grant Numbers JP15H05179 and JP25101003, and the Institute of Developing Economies-Japan External Trade Organization are acknowledged.

For this purpose, the study employs a sample of 31 Asian countries during the period spanning from 2004 to 2016. Composite indicators for the three financial dimensions are constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) based on normalized variables. We find that the trends are fluctuating across countries and there is no clear pattern in several cases. The findings are robust to different normalization techniques. Furthermore, the impact of financial inclusion on financial efficiency and sustainability is analysed using Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS). The estimation results indicate that growing financial inclusion negatively affects financial efficiency while favourably influences financial sustainability. The findings hold for the whole sample as well as across the two subsamples of countries with different income levels. This implies that while there are policy synergies between growing financial inclusion and maintaining financial sustainability, proper attention needs to be paid to the side effect of financial inefficiency associated with increasing financial inclusion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Financial Inclusion; Panel Data Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Standardization","","","","This work was part of the project “ Solutions for Promoting Financial Inclusion in Vietnam ”, supported by The Office of National S&T research Programs (ONARP) of Vietnam , grant number KX.01.30/16-20 .","Adu, George Asumah, Financial development and economic growth in Ghana: Does the measure of financial development matter?, Review of Development Finance, 3, 4, pp. 192-203, (2013); European Journal of Economics Finance and Administrative Sciences, (2018); Bank Credit During the 2008 Financial Crisis A Cross Country Comparison, (2010); International Journal of Business and Social Science, (2011); Allen, Franklin, The foundations of financial inclusion: Understanding ownership and use of formal accounts, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 27, pp. 1-30, (2016); Ang, James B., Research, technological change and financial liberalization in South Korea, Journal of Macroeconomics, 32, 1, pp. 457-468, (2010); Ang, James B., Financial liberalization, financial sector development and growth: Evidence from Malaysia, Journal of Development Economics, 84, 1, pp. 215-233, (2007); Athanasoglou, Panayiotis P., Bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic determinants of bank profitability, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 18, 2, pp. 121-136, (2008); Babajide, Abiola Ayopo, Financial inclusion and economic growth in Nigeria, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 5, 3, pp. 629-637, (2015); Financial Inclusion for Asia S Unbanked, (2018)","","Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi","","","","","","22148469; 22148450","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069918075"

However, introducing this type of system in developing cities may be a challenge given residents’ common practice of using private vehicles, especially motorcycles, for transportation. Taking Ho Chi Minh City as an example, this study aims to enhance understanding of preferences for PT. A dataset of 591 motorcycle users about their responses to the planned PT system was analyzed, considering their heterogeneity. The usage frequencies of PT were treated as an indicator of preference. The potential customers were classified into latent classes based on the assumption that there are differences in the factors that influence specific groups. A latent class choice model including two components of class assignment and utility functions was estimated to explain the preferences. Two latent classes were identified: the “collectivistic” class (69.5% of sample) and the “individualistic” class (30.5% of sample). The correlation between preferences for the current bus system and the new PT was captured within each class. The positive roles of social interaction and agreement with PT projects were observed in the “collectivistic” class, while the positive role of distance to work and negative role of dissatisfaction with service were found in the “individualistic” class. Comfort significantly impacted both classes, but the “collectivistic” class responded in a more positive way. The results suggest that differential marketing strategies should be developed to encourage users with different characteristics to make the change to PT.

This paper explores the perceptions of local enterprises in Yakushima, Japan, concerning tourism’s contribution to the local economy, its effects on income distribution, and its impacts on spatial differences among villages. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 local tourism stakeholders. We found that although all respondents perceive tourism as contributing positively to Yakushima’s economy, they have different perspectives on income distribution among tourism participants. They also raised questions about the flow of money from tourism. The findings reveal that tourism may not necessarily contribute to equal income distribution and is perceived as creating unequal benefits. Also, it creates a gap between tourist villages and non-tourist villages. Our research suggests that tourism policies aimed at equal income distribution and balanced spatial development should consider the perspectives of all tourism stakeholders. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Income Distribution; Japan; Local Enterprises; Perspectives; Tourism Contribution; Yakushima","","","","This research was supported by Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03274], and the author (V.

Recently, with the advanced technology of smart meters, both active and reactive power outputs of PV inverters are tuned to optimize network operation e.g. minimizing network loss and PVs' active power curtailment in centralized methods. However, searching the optimal output of PVs in a large feasible operational region along with several variables due to the increasing number of PV systems requires a centralized controller much time to converge and cannot efficiently catch up with the change of PVs' output in the real operation. In this paper, by narrowing the searching region, boundary optimal inverter dispatch method is proposed. More reliable simulation outputs are obtained within a shorter calculation time, making the proposed method more applicable in the practical operation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Optimal Power Flow; Photovoltaic (pv) Systems; Power Distribution; Power Quality; Reactive Power Control; Electric Inverters; Electric Load Flow; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Power Quality; Reactive Power; Real Time Systems; Active And Reactive Power; Advanced Technology; Centralized Controllers; Medium-voltage Distribution Systems; Optimal Power Flows; Optimal Power Output; Photovoltaic Systems; Power Distributions; Power Control","Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Power quality; Reactive power; Real time systems; Active and Reactive Power; Advanced technology; Centralized controllers; Medium-voltage distribution systems; Optimal power flows; Optimal power output; Photovoltaic systems; Power distributions; Power control","","","","Canova, Aldo, Electrical impact of photovoltaic plant in distributed network, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 45, 1, pp. 341-347, (2009); Siti, Mukwanga Willy, Reconfiguration and load balancing in the LV and MV distribution networks for optimal performance, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 22, 4, pp. 2534-2540, (2007); Huat, Chua Kein, Energy storage system for mitigating voltage unbalance on low-voltage networks with photovoltaic systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 27, 4, pp. 1783-1790, (2012); Liu, Xiaohu, Coordinated control of distributed energy storage system with tap changer transformers for voltage rise mitigation under high photovoltaic penetration, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 2, pp. 897-906, (2012); Hossain, Mohammed Imran, Investigation of the interaction between step voltage regulators and large-scale photovoltaic systems regarding voltage regulation and unbalance, IET Renewable Power Generation, 10, 3, pp. 299-309, (2016); Farivar, Masoud, Optimal inverter VAR control in distribution systems with high PV penetration, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, (2012); Dall’Anese, Emiliano, Optimal dispatch of photovoltaic inverters in residential distribution systems, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 2, pp. 487-497, (2014); Šulc, Petr, Optimal distributed control of reactive power via the alternating direction method of multipliers, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 29, 4, pp. 968-977, (2014); Demirok, Erhan, Local reactive power control methods for overvoltage prevention of distributed solar inverters in low-voltage grids, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 1, 2, pp. 174-182, (2011); Su, Xiangjing, Optimal PV inverter reactive power control and real power curtailment to improve performance of unbalanced four-wire LV distribution networks, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 5, 3, pp. 967-977, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering (CSEE); IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES)","2019 IEEE Sustainable Power and Energy Conference, iSPEC 2019","","Beijing","157236","","9781728149301","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079509594"

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire survey is conducted to collect data from Vietnamese manufacturing companies in the electronic/electric industry. Collected data were analyzed by using correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis. Findings: This study points out the current situation of implementing supply chain quality management practices in Vietnamese manufacturing companies which are more focused on internal quality management practices than upstream and downstream quality management practices. Correlation and regression analyses that demonstrate the significant linkage between supply chain quality management practices and operational performance are confirmed in this study. Upstream and downstream quality management are found to be the significant predictor for high performance on quality, cost and delivery. Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations that can be addressed in future studies. The first limitation is the relatively small sample size due to lack of time and resources. These constraint can be overcome in future works by collecting more data in diverse countries and industries to re-examine the framework. Furthermore, larger sample will allow researchers to apply other statistical methods such as path analysis and structural equation modelling, which would provide interesting results. Another limitation is that the collected data in this paper mainly rely on perceptions of the respondents, which may cause individual bias in analysis. To reduce this type of bias, both subjective and objective measurement of scales, especially performance measures, can be used in future studies. Practical implications: This study provides empirical evidences that practitioners can use to improve a specific type of performance, especially in the context of emerging economies. In a turbulent and unpredictable business environment, it is emphasized that quality management should be extended at supply chain level to utilize the capabilities of external partners. In Vietnamese manufacturing firms, implementation of such practices as information technology links, information sharing, supplier involvement and customer involvement would lead to high level of operational performance. Originality/value: Supply chain management and quality management are two fields of study that have gained much attention of researchers. However, the concept of supply chain quality management as well as its impact on business performance have not been fully studied, especially in context of a developing country. Through extensive literature review, this study proposes and tests an analytical framework that characterizes supply chain quality management into three elements: internal quality management, upstream quality management and downstream quality management. Subsequently, their impact on quality, cost and delivery are analyzed to provide better understanding of supply chain quality management in Vietnamese context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Countries; Quality Management; Supply Chain Management","","","","SCM and QM are two fields of study that have gained much attention of researchers.

In order to deal with unsafe food situation, the demand for food hygiene has increased in recent years as well as the consequent increase in price accepted by consumers. This study aimed to estimate consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) and to examine the determining factors influencing their WTP for safe pork using double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method (DBDC CVM). The data were collected from a survey with a sample size of 134 respondents in Hanoi, Vietnam using two sets of questionnaires on the consumption of rib and shoulder of pork. The results revealed that the percentages of the consumers willing to pay a premium for more hygiene shoulder and rib of pork were 81.75% and 73.01%, respectively. The mean WTP was 129,000 VND (US$6.07) for both safe shoulder and rib, 48.7% and 37.8% higher than the regular market price, respectively. The results showed that consumers’ awareness of the risk of unhealthy pork, household income and expenditure were the positive determinants to WTP; meanwhile, the amount of pork consumption per month negatively affected the willingness to pay more for shoulder and rib of pork. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contingent Valuation Method; Hanoi; Safe Pork; Vietnam; Willingness To Pay","","","","","Alberini, Anna, Efficiency vs bias of willingness-to-pay estimates: Bivariate and interval-data models, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 29, 2, pp. 169-180, (1995); Alberini, Anna, Optimal designs for discrete choice contingent valuation surveys: Single-bound, double-bound, and bivariate models, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 28, 3, pp. 287-306, (1995); Bateman, Ian J., Bound and path effects in double and choice contingent valuation, Resource and Energy Economics, 23, 3, pp. 191-213, (2001); Braun, Carola, Validity of Willingness to Pay Measures under Preference Uncertainty, PLOS ONE, 11, 4, (2016); Breidert, Christoph, A review of methods for measuring willingness-to-pay, Innovative Marketing, 2, 4, pp. 8-32, (2006); A Primer on Nonmarket Valuation, (2003); Carthy, Trevor, On the Contingent Valuation of Safety and the Safety of Contingent Valuation: Part 2 - The CV/SG ""Chained"" Approach, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 17, 3, pp. 187-214, (1998); Chien, Yulan, A general model of starting point bias in double-bounded dichotomous contingent valuation surveys, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 50, 2, pp. 362-377, (2005); Cooper, Joseph C., One-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice contingent valuation, Review of Economics and Statistics, 84, 4, pp. 742-750, (2002); Land Economics, (1992)","","Routledge aabs@uw.edu","","","","","","15286983; 08974438","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058141949"

In recent years, the fast development electronic medical records (EMRs) has provided valuable resources for solving healthcare issues, especially learning and recommending treatments. However, most of the related studies are limited in exploiting various patient information, handling varying-length treatment records, capturing different kinds of treatment patterns and interpreting the recommendation mechanism. This research proposes three methods, one for learning and two for recommending treatments, to overcome the above drawbacks. All methods adopt a mixed-variate restrict Boltzmann machine to represent different kinds of patient records. The treatment learning method captures significant changes in prescription indication to split varying-length records flexibly and organizes sequences of prescription drugs into regimen trees to reveal many more different kinds of treatment patterns. The two treatment recommendation methods illustrate different ideas that can improve the treatment recommendation mechanism by combining the treatments derived from patient groups and neighbor patients. Our experimental evaluation was conducted on three acute disease cohorts extracted from the MIMIC III database. The obtained results show that the proposed methods are able to provide different kinds of treatment patterns and yield competitive efficacy with better interpretability as compared to relevant studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic Medical Records; Healthcare Mining; Treatment Patterns; Treatment Recommendation; Treatment Regimen; E-learning; Medical Computing; Electronic Medical Record; Electronic Medical Records (emrs); Experimental Evaluation; Recommendation Mechanism; Recommendation Methods; Treatment Patterns; Treatment Recommendation; Treatment Regimen; Patient Treatment","E-learning; Medical computing; Electronic medical record; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Experimental evaluation; Recommendation mechanism; Recommendation methods; Treatment patterns; Treatment recommendation; Treatment regimen; Patient treatment","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by Vietnam National University at Ho Chi Minh City in the project “Development of core technology for exploiting electronic medical records” under the grant B2019-42-01 and by Asian Office of Aerospace R&D (Japan) under agreement number FA2386-18-1-4029 .

To capture such information, we should exploit the characteristics of education end-users’ requests with high spatial–temporal locality. This paper aims to develop resource popularity modeling techniques for enhancing the performance of educational resource prefetching. Specifically, a novel topic model, built on an accelerated spectral clustering and an ontology concept similarity, is proposed to support resource access based on semantic features, including topic relevance and spatial–temporal locality. Using the proposed model, an adaptive prefetching inference approach is presented to associate possible popular resources in the future data requests. Also, an efficient prefetching management mechanism incorporating with replica techniques is suggested to design resource cloud storage systems for geo-distributed educational applications. Experiments over a simulation setting and a real-world case study with seven million users across China are carried out. Results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Educational Resources; Prefetching Mechanism; Semantic Inference; Spatial–temporal Locality; Topic Information; Clustering Algorithms; Human Computer Interaction; Semantics; Educational Resource; Prefetching; Semantic Inference; Temporal Locality; Topic Information; Digital Storage","Clustering algorithms; Human computer interaction; Semantics; Educational resource; Prefetching; Semantic inference; Temporal locality; Topic information; Digital storage","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61877020), the Science and Technology Projects of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2015A030401087, 2018B010109002), the Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou Municipality, China (No. 201904010393), and the Golden Seed Project of Challenge Cup of Extra-Curricular Academic Competition Works by South China Normal University, China (No. 19JXKC01).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61877020 ), the Science and Technology Projects of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2015A030401087 , 2018B010109002 ), the Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou Municipality, China (No. 201904010393 ), and the Golden Seed Project of Challenge Cup of Extra-Curricular Academic Competition Works by South China Normal University, China (No. 19JXKC01 ).","González-Martínez, José Antonio, Cloud computing and education: A state-of-the-art survey, Computers and Education, 80, pp. 132-151, (2015); Caminero, A.

Carry-over variables are those continuously held from one term to another, reflecting dynamic components. Apart from considering dynamic aspects, the DEA model called dynamic slacks-based measure with network structure can address various inputs and outputs at both stages and multiple intermediates that link the two stages. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model under the assumption of variable returns to scale to the performance evaluation of 30 insurance companies in Malaysia from 2008 to 2016. Specifically, we gauge resource management and investment efficiencies as the two production stages of insurance companies. While investment asset is considered the carry-over variable, investment income is treated as one of the ultimate outputs. Results indicate that the discriminatory power of the overall performance is high when we consider investments, particularly investment assets, as a carry-over variable. Moreover, we employ a multi-criteria decision analysis to compare all insurance companies in a common setting, including each ratio of liquidity, profitability, and leverage. The decision to include these ratios is made after performing regression analyses.

One explanation for this is an underestimation of the environmental and economic values of these practices. The present study aimed at estimating environmental and technical efficiencies for all methods of rice production and then comparing each method in terms of efficiencies and economic benefits. Survey data included responses from farmers who used either eco-friendly or conventional rice cultivation methods. Latent class stochastic frontier analysis shows that the average technical efficiency across all methods was 85.02% and environmental efficiency across all methods was 22.58%. Among individual methods, floating rice had the highest technical and environmental efficiency scores. Ecologically engineered rice had the lowest economic and environmental performance. The average environmental efficiency of conventional rice production was 16.25%, which is significantly higher than that of ecologically engineered rice, large-scale rice, and GlobalGAP rice. The results indicate considerable overuse of agrochemical inputs and also point to other specific factors of production that influence these efficiencies.

In large-scale group decision making problems, owing to various backgrounds and psychological cognition, it is natural to use heterogeneous representation forms (quantitative or qualitative) to express distinct preference information for different decision-makers. In this paper, we investigate the consensus reaching process in the environment of heterogeneous large-scale group decision making. A novel ordinal consensus measure with an objective threshold based on preference orderings is proposed. This process contains five parts: (1) obtaining ordinal preferences; (2) classifying all decision-makers into several subgroups using the ordinal k-means clustering algorithm; (3) measuring consensus levels of subgroups and the global group using novel ordinal consensus indexes; (4) providing suggestions for decision-makers to revise preferences using feedback strategies; (5) obtaining final decision result. An illustrative example is provided to verify the implementation of the proposed consensus model. Lastly, we discuss the approaches to determine the appropriate number of clusters and the initialization center points for the proposed ordinal k-means clustering algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heterogeneous; K-means Clustering; Large-scale Group Decision Making; Ordinal Consensus; Preference Relation; K-means Clustering; Feedback Strategies; Group Decision Making Problems; Heterogeneous; Large-scale Group; Ordinal Consensus; Ordinal Preference; Preference Information; Preference Relation; Decision Making","K-means clustering; Feedback strategies; Group decision making problems; Heterogeneous; Large-scale group; Ordinal consensus; Ordinal preference; Preference information; Preference relation; Decision making","","","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71771156 ), the 2019 Soft Science Project of Sichuan Science and Technology Department (No. 2019JDR0141 ), the 2019 Sichuan Planning Project of Social Science (No. SC18A007 ), and the Graduate Student’s Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, China (No. 2018YJSY038 ).","Rules for Reaching Consensus A Modern Approach to Decision Making, (1994); Herrera-Viedma, Enrique Enrique, A review of soft consensus models in a fuzzy environment, Information Fusion, 17, 1, pp. 4-13, (2014); Herrera, Francisco P., A model of consensus in group decision making under linguistic assessments, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 78, 1, pp. 73-87, (1996); Liao, Huchang, Framework of group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy preference information, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 23, 4, pp. 1211-1227, (2015); He, Yue, A consensus reaching model for hesitant information with different preference structures, Knowledge-Based Systems, 135, pp. 99-112, (2017); Xu, Xuanhua, Consensus model for multi-criteria large-group emergency decision making considering non-cooperative behaviors and minority opinions, Decision Support Systems, 79, pp. 150-160, (2015); Xu, Xuanhua, A dynamical consensus method based on exit-delegation mechanism for large group emergency decision making, Knowledge-Based Systems, 86, pp. 237-249, (2015); Palomares, Iván, A consensus model to detect and manage noncooperative behaviors in large-scale group decision making, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 22, 3, pp. 516-530, (2014); Liu, Bingsheng, A two-layer weight determination method for complex multi-attribute large-group decision-making experts in a linguistic environment, Information Fusion, 23, pp. 156-165, (2015); Zadeh, Lotfi A., Fuzzy sets, Information and control, 8, 3, pp. 338-353, (1965)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065798233"

This study adopts the technology–organization–environment (TOE) model to explore the influence of these factors on the innovation decision of firms in the context of a developing country—in particular, Vietnam. The results show that the technological factors that are represented by a higher percentage of skilled workforce and that are based in technologically intensive sectors appear to be critical elements for the innovation decision. The organizational factors “firm size” and “ownership” significantly affect the innovation decision. With regard to ownership, a surprising finding is the lack of innovative activities in wholly foreign-owned firms, which is in contrast with other studies. Furthermore, regarding the environmental factors, the findings show that the financial support from the local government is unrelated to the innovation engagement of Vietnamese firms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Innovation Decision; Manufacturing Firms; Toe Model; Vietnam","","","","","Aghion, Philippe, Competition and innovation: An inverted-u relationship, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120, 2, pp. 701-728, (2005); Almeida, Rita K., Openness and technological innovations in developing countries: Evidence from firm-level surveys, Journal of Development Studies, 44, 5, pp. 701-727, (2008); Aralica, Zoran, Innovation Propensity in Croatian Enterprises: Results of a Community Innovation Survey, South East European Journal of Economics and Business, 3, 1, pp. 77-88, (2008); Arundel, Anthony V., What percentage of innovations are patented?

However, since it is placed in a system that many other practices are conducted simultaneously, the practice itself will interact with other ones (i.e. affect/be affected). As a consequence, the efficiency of the affected practice is increased and it is expected to maximize the impact of SCM practices on OP. This mechanism is named the “resonant” influence that is a new approach in the SCM literature. The purpose of this paper is to test the above mechanism toward an insight into the relationship between SCM and OP. Design/methodology/approach: Two models were compared: the competitive models only exist in direct effects; and the other contains relationships between practices that are able to show the mechanism of the resonant influence, i.e. the hypothetical model. A data set gained from Vietnamese garment enterprises was used to validate the mechanism of the resonant influence. Findings: Empirical evidence from Vietnamese garment sector showed that the competitive models could explain 42.8, 26.3 and 34 percent variance of operational performance, customer satisfaction and financial performance, respectively. In the meantime, the hypothetical model containing the resonant influence is capable to explain 69.5, 33.1 and 57.3 percent. For the impact of each SCM practice on OP, all relationships in the hypothetical model are also greater than those in competitive ones. These results supported the mechanism of the resonant influence. Research limitations/implications: This research provides an insight into the relationship between SCM practices and OP. By the resonant influence, the effectiveness of each affected SCM practice itself is magnified and OP is also increased remarkably. Practical implications: Understanding the resonant influence, companies can apply this mechanism to enhance effectiveness of SCM practices at the lowest cost. To this end, the SCM practices should be implemented simultaneously as an integrated system rather than independent ones and the structural model proposed in this study is able to be used as “a guide map” for applying this mechanism. Originality/value: This is one of pioneer empirical studies in the SCM literature that proposed and validated the concept of “resonant influence.” © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Organizational Performance; Resonant Influence; Supply Chain Management; Supply Chain Management Practices","","","","This work was financed with FEDER funds by Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade (COMPETE), national funds by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) through Project: FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-022674 and the JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. JP18J11566.

However, there is no study on profit efficiency of safe tea producers, which are therefore barriers for farmers and policymakers in terms of extending the safe tea production practice in Vietnam. Thus, this study investigated the profit efficiency of tea production practices using a stochastic profit frontier function. We applied propensity score matching to control for self-selection in assessing the profit efficiency of safe and conventional tea farming. Our results indicated that the average profit efficiency of tea farmers was around 74%, suggesting 26% of profit was lost due to inefficiency. Furthermore, significant different profit efficiency was observed between the two farmer groups. We further found that tea farmers with larger production scale, better irrigation system, accessing extension service are more likely to adopt safe tea practices than others are. Thus, public policies should focus on improving profit efficiency and facilitating adoption of eco-friendly production practice, and also supporting innovations to improve farmers’ production conditions, including the access to extension service, irrigation system, enlarged farm size, and labor-saving machinery. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Profit Efficiency; Propensity Score Matching; Safe Tea; Vietgap; Vietnam; Agricultural Worker; Crop Production; Farm Size; Governance Approach; Irrigation System; Profitability; Standard (regulation); Stochasticity; Tea","agricultural worker; crop production; farm size; governance approach; irrigation system; profitability; standard (regulation); stochasticity; tea","","","","Abdulai, Awudu Mumin, Structural adjustment and economic efficiency of rice farmers in Northern Ghana, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 48, 3, pp. 503-520, (2000); Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Wasim Aktar, Md, Impact of pesticides use in agriculture: Their benefits and hazards, Interdisciplinary Toxicology, 2, 1, pp. 1-12, (2009); Ali, Mubarak, Economic efficiency of small farmers in a changing world: A survey of recent evidence, Journal of International Development, 3, 1, pp. 1-27, (1991); Ali, Mubarik, Profit efficiency among Basmati rice producers in Pakistan Punjab, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 71, 2, pp. 303-310, (1989); Arnade, Carlos Anthony, Estimating a profit function in the presence of inefficiency: An application to Russian agriculture, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 27, 1, pp. 94-113, (2002); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Caliendo, Marco, Some practical guidance for the implementation of propensity score matching, Journal of Economic Surveys, 22, 1, pp. 31-72, (2008); Economics of Food Safety the Case of Green Onions and Hepatitis A Outbreaks, (2025)","","Springer Netherlands rbk@louisiana.edu","","","","","","15732975; 1387585X","","EDSNB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042105265"

Previous findings have shown that aberrant expression of miRNAs is associated with tumorigenesis and may lead to many human complex diseases. Although large amount of miRNAs have been identified in various species, unfortunately, the functions of majority of them still remain to be unraveled. The huge volume omics data provide an unprecedented opportunity for prioritizing disease miRNA candidates by computational methods, which contributes to elucidating the progression of human diseases and greatly facilitates cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a computational method called MRSLA to discover disease-associated miRNAs. We formulate the disease miRNA prioritization task as a recommender system that recommends those most likely miRNAs for given diseases based on low-rank approximation framework, which is an efficient machine learning algorithm that could effectively incorporate multi-modal features into the prediction model and produce a good performance. In MRSLA, we first utilized multi-view data sources, including known miRNA–disease associations, disease semantic information, experimentally verified miRNA–target gene interactions, and gene–gene interaction network, to estimate the miRNA similarity and disease similarity and then construct a bilayer heterogeneous network. After that, we project the miRNA–disease associations into two subspaces and develop a low-rank approximation-based recommendation method to predict disease miRNA candidates. In addition, to encourage sparsity and enhance the biological relevance of the results, the manifold regularizations and L <inf>1</inf> -norm constraints are imposed into the objective formulation to guide the prediction process. The results shown that MRSLA achieves superior performance compared with other methods and could effectively discover potential disease-associated miRNAs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disease-associated Mirnas; Heterogeneous Network; Manifold Regularization; Micrornas (mirnas); Recommendation Model; Approximation Algorithms; Approximation Theory; Association Reactions; Computational Methods; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Genes; Heterogeneous Networks; Lead Compounds; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Recommender Systems; Rna; Semantics; Disease Associations; Disease Similarities; Gene Interaction Networks; Learning-based Methods; Low Rank Approximations; Manifold Regularizations; Micrornas; Recommendation Methods; Diseases","Approximation algorithms; Approximation theory; Association reactions; Computational methods; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Genes; Heterogeneous networks; Lead compounds; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Recommender systems; RNA; Semantics; Disease associations; Disease similarities; Gene interaction networks; Learning-based methods; Low rank approximations; Manifold regularizations; MicroRNAs; Recommendation methods; Diseases","","","Funding text 1: This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 61572180, 61873089, 61473259), and the Hunan Provincial Science & Technology Project Foundation (2018TP1018, 2018RS3065).; Funding text 2: This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 61572180 , 61873089 , 61473259 ), and the Hunan Provincial Science & Technology Project Foundation ( 2018TP1018 , 2018RS3065 ).","Jopling, Catherine L., Molecular biology: Modulation of hepatitis C virus RNA abundance by a liver-specific MicroRNA, Science, 309, 5740, pp. 1577-1581, (2005); Yang, Li, HMDD v2.0: A database for experimentally supported human microRNA and disease associations, Nucleic Acids Research, 42, D1, pp. D1070-D1074, (2014); Yang, Zhen, DbDEMC 2.0: Updated database of differentially expressed miRNAs in human cancers, Nucleic Acids Research, 45, D1, pp. D812-D818, (2017); Cheng, Angie M., Antisense inhibition of human miRNAs and indications for an involvement of miRNA in cell growth and apoptosis, Nucleic Acids Research, 33, 4, pp. 1290-1297, (2005); Kalinowski, Felicity C., Regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Signaling and Erlotinib Sensitivity in Head and Neck Cancer Cells by miR-7, PLOS ONE, 7, 10, (2012); Gokhale, Amit, Distinctive microRNA signature of medulloblastomas associated with the WNT signaling pathway, Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics, 6, 4, pp. 521-529, (2010); Xiao, Qiu, CeModule: An integrative framework for discovering regulatory patterns from genomic data in cancer, BMC Bioinformatics, 20, 1, (2019); Jiang, Qinghua, Prioritization of disease microRNAs through a human phenome-microRNAome network, BMC Systems Biology, 4, SUPPL. 1, (2010); Shi, Hongbo, Walking the interactome to identify human miRNA-disease associations through the functional link between miRNA targets and disease genes, BMC Systems Biology, 7, (2013); Li, Xia, Prioritizing human cancer microRNAs based on genes' functional consistency between microRNA and cancer, Nucleic Acids Research, 39, 22, (2011)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063537933"

This paper investigates the linkages between financial inclusion and macroeconomic stability, which has not yet been thoroughly examined in the literature, for 22 emerging and frontier economies from 2008 to 2015, with particular focus on a potential optimal level. Using the panel threshold estimation technique, the empirical findings show that financial inclusion, as approximated by the growth rate in the number of bank branches over 100,000 account holders, is found to enhance financial stability under a certain threshold. Financial inclusion is also found to be of benefit to maintaining stable inflation and output growth.

This paper presents a moth–flame optimization-based protein complex prediction algorithm, called MFOC. First of all, we build the reliable weighted dynamic PPI networks by synthesizing topological and biological information. After that, we utilize a layer-by-layer scheme to find the cores of protein complexes as the flames and let the moths fly spirally around the flames to form the complexes. To be specific, the critical proteins have priority as the hearts and cores are extended by the hearts. And then we use MFOC algorithm to make the moths converge to the flames in order to obtain the protein complexes. At last, a two-step filtration operation is executed to refine the predicted protein complexes. The proposed algorithm MFOC is applied to the reliable weighted dynamic protein interaction networks including DIP, Krogan and MIPS, and the numerous comparison results show that MFOC outperforms other classic algorithms for identifying protein complexes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Critical Protein; Moth–flame Optimization (mfo) Algorithm; Protein Complex Prediction; Weighted Dynamic Ppi Network; Forecasting; Proteins; Biological Information; Biological Process; Optimization-based Algorithm; Ppi Networks; Prediction Algorithms; Protein Complexes; Protein Interaction; Synthetic Dynamics; Complex Networks","Forecasting; Proteins; Biological information; Biological process; Optimization-based algorithm; Ppi networks; Prediction algorithms; Protein complexes; Protein interaction; Synthetic dynamics; Complex networks","","","Funding text 1: This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61672334 , 61502290 , 61401263 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201901010 ).; Funding text 2: This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61672334, 61502290, 61401263) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. GK201901010).","Spirin, Victor, Protein complexes and functional modules in molecular networks, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100, 21, pp. 12123-12128, (2003); Gavin, Anne Claude, Functional organization of the yeast proteome by systematic analysis of protein complexes, Nature, 415, 6868, pp. 141-147, (2002); De Las Rivas, Javier, Protein-protein interactions essentials: Key concepts to building and analyzing interactome networks, PLOS Computational Biology, 6, 6, pp. 1-8, (2010); Bader, Gary D., An automated method for finding molecular complexes in large protein interaction networks, BMC Bioinformatics, 4, (2003); Altaf-Ul-Amin, Md, Development and implementation of an algorithm for detection of protein complexes in large interaction networks, BMC Bioinformatics, 7, (2006); Graph Clustering by Flow Simulation, (2000); Nepusz, Tamás, Detecting overlapping protein complexes in protein-protein interaction networks, Nature Methods, 9, 5, pp. 471-472, (2012); Shen, Xianjun, Neighbor affinity based algorithm for discovering temporal protein complex from dynamic PPI network, Methods, 110, pp. 90-96, (2016); Lei, Xiujuan, Topology potential based seed-growth method to identify protein complexes on dynamic PPI data, Information Sciences, 425, pp. 140-153, (2018); Ou-Yang, Le, Detecting Protein Complexes from Signed Protein-Protein Interaction Networks, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, 12, 6, pp. 1333-1344, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062065788"

We find that results based on a smooth transition vector autoregressive (STVAR) model provides a plausible and robust explanation to the behavior of the US natural gas market, which asymmetrically reacts in bad times and good times. During times of recession, natural gas production shrinks in response to a positive oil price shock, while the corresponding response is found to be positive in times of expansion. The positive relationship between the price of natural gas and crude oil is found to be more prominent in expansions, especially in the long run. In addition, the results also reveal that US economic activity is much more sensitive to oil and natural gas price shocks occurring in bad times than in good times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Cycle; Natural Gas Market; Oil Price Shock; Stvar Model; Commerce; Crude Oil; Expansion; Gases; Natural Gas Well Production; Asymmetric Reaction; Business Cycles; Economic Activities; Natural Gas Markets; Natural-gas Production; Oil And Natural Gas; Oil Price Shocks; Smooth Transitions; Natural Gas; Asymmetry; Business Cycle; Economic Activity; Energy Market; Natural Gas; Price Dynamics; Vector Autoregression; United States","Commerce; Crude oil; Expansion; Gases; Natural gas well production; Asymmetric reaction; Business cycles; Economic activities; Natural gas markets; Natural-gas production; Oil and natural gas; Oil price shocks; Smooth transitions; Natural gas; asymmetry; business cycle; economic activity; energy market; natural gas; price dynamics; vector autoregression; United States","","","This study is conducted as a part of the Project “Economic and Financial Analysis of Commodity Markets” undertaken at Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI).

As part of the study, we used the observational method to help determine consumers’ visual behavior and an on-site survey questionnaire to collect data for measuring the qualities of the bookstore-café.

The by-products, including waste paper sludge ash (PSA), fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF), and metakaolin (MK) of different proportions (5%, 10%, 15%) in RAC, were used in two methods: replacement and addition methods. The use of by-products (mineral admixtures) to mitigate the low quality of RAC was demonstrated through experimental outcomes in this study. The addition of industrial by-products was presented as a promising alternative for the addition of more Portland cement in RAC to enhance RAC's quality. The results showed that the strength and durability of RAC containing mineral admixtures in the addition method were higher than the addition of more cement or the replacement method. Notably, PSA considerably improved the mechanical properties of RAC at an early age, and it substantially improved the resistance of RAC to acid and sulfate attacks. At 90 days, FA and MK improved mechanical properties of RAC greater than SF and PSA did. Among combinations, the proportions of by-products in RAC of 5% PSA, 10% SF, 15% MK and 15% FA can produce the highest performance of RAC with 100% coarse recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fly Ash; Metakaolin; Mineral Admixtures; Recycled Aggregate Concrete; Silica Fume; Waste Paper Sludge Ash; Concrete Additives; Concrete Products; Durability; Fly Ash; Minerals; Portland Cement; Recycling; Silica Fume; Sulfur Compounds; Waste Paper; Coarse Recycled Concrete Aggregate; Different Proportions; Industrial By-products; Metakaolins; Mineral Admixtures; Paper Sludge Ash; Recycled Aggregate Concrete; Replacement Methods; Mechanical Properties; Concrete; Fly Ash; Portland Cement","Concrete additives; Concrete products; Durability; Fly ash; Minerals; Portland cement; Recycling; Silica fume; Sulfur compounds; Waste paper; Coarse recycled concrete aggregate; Different proportions; Industrial by-products; Metakaolins; Mineral admixtures; Paper sludge ash; Recycled aggregate concrete; Replacement methods; Mechanical properties; Concrete; Fly Ash; Portland Cement","","","","Abd Elhakam, Ali, Influence of self-healing, mixing method and adding silica fume on mechanical properties of recycled aggregates concrete, Construction and Building Materials, 35, pp. 421-427, (2012); Acharya, Prasanna Kumar, Acid resistance, sulphate resistance and strength properties of concrete containing ferrochrome ash (FA) and lime, Construction and Building Materials, 120, pp. 241-250, (2016); Akhtar, Ali, Construction and demolition waste generation and properties of recycled aggregate concrete: A global perspective, Journal of Cleaner Production, 186, pp. 262-281, (2018); Alnahhal, Mohammed Fouad, Effect of aggressive chemicals on durability and microstructure properties of concrete containing crushed new concrete aggregate and non-traditional supplementary cementitious materials, Construction and Building Materials, 163, pp. 482-495, (2018); Bai, J., Compressive strength and hydration of wastepaper sludge ash-ground granulated blastfurnace slag blended pastes, Cement and Concrete Research, 33, 8, pp. 1189-1202, (2003); Behnood, Ali, Methods for measuring pH in concrete: A review, Construction and Building Materials, 105, pp. 176-188, (2016); Gonzalez-Fonteboa, Belen, Stress-strain relationship in axial compression for concrete using recycled saturated coarse aggregate, Construction and Building Materials, 25, 5, pp. 2335-2342, (2011); Berndt, Marita Louise Allan, Properties of sustainable concrete containing fly ash, slag and recycled concrete aggregate, Construction and Building Materials, 23, 7, pp. 2606-2613, (2009); Brand, Alexander S., Initial moisture and mixing effects on higher quality recycled coarse aggregate concrete, Construction and Building Materials, 79, pp. 83-89, (2015); Bravo, Miguel, Superplasticizer's efficiency on the mechanical properties of recycled aggregates concrete: Influence of recycled aggregates composition and incorporation ratio, Construction and Building Materials, 153, pp. 129-138, (2017)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060065300"

We used data from a farm-household survey comprising of 70 contract and 96 noncontract respondents, and apply the Student's t-test and ordinary least square regression model for data analysis. We found that farmers with larger rice plantations are unlikely to engage in contract farming, and that market outlets and output price for contract growers tend to be ensured compared with noncontract ones. The findings reveal that contract farming has a significantly positive impact on rice-farming profitability in terms of average return and average rate of return on variable cost when controlling for observable characteristics of household and farm. The results suggest that contract farming may enable rice farmers to raise their rice income as well as household income. The policy implication may be that contract farming may not be feasible for all rice farmers and rice business firms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Average Rate Of Return; Contract Farming; Mekong Delta; Return; Rice; Contract Farming; Crop Yield; Household Survey; Least Squares Method; Policy Implementation; Profitability; Return Period; Rice; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","contract farming; crop yield; household survey; least squares method; policy implementation; profitability; return period; rice; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","","Barrett, Christopher B., Smallholder participation in contract farming: Comparative evidence from five countries, World Development, 40, 4, pp. 715-730, (2012); Bellemare, Marc F., As You Sow, So Shall You Reap: The Welfare Impacts of Contract Farming, World Development, 40, 7, pp. 1418-1434, (2012); Bolwig, Simon, The Economics of Smallholder Organic Contract Farming in Tropical Africa, World Development, 37, 6, pp. 1094-1104, (2009); Journal of Southeast Asian Economies, (2013); Vietnam and Lesson Learnt from Chiba Prefecture Japan, (2014); Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research, (2017); Dedehouanou, Senakpon Fidèle Ange, Does contracting make farmers happy?

Therefore, improving productivity in agriculture is indispensable to the sustainability of the country. This research examined productivity and its determinants from 420 enterprises operating in agriculture. Productivity was measured as the total factor productivity (TFP) obtained from fixed and random effects models. The determinants of TFP including size and age, share of state and foreign ownership, export, accessibility to Internet and bank loan of firms, controlled for year fixed effects, were analyzed. It was shown that 74.6% companies in the agricultural sector were small in size (< 10 < 200 employees). Although the number of large firms (>300 employees) explained 10.6%, they had a remarkable and positive TFP (38.8%, p < 0.01), while both small and very small (<10, and <200 employees, respectively) had strikingly negative TFP values (−71.3% and −32.1%, respectively, p < 0.01), as compared to the medium sizes (< 200 < 300 employees). It was also revealed that although foreign ownership was only 3.8% on average, it had a notably positive effect on TFP (55.0%, p < 0.01). In contrast, state ownership accounted for 30.7%, but it had a negative influence on TFP (−7.5%). The export contributed a negligible and statistically significant effect to TFP (2.6%), which might be attributed to a limited number of firms (4.5%) having mobility in agricultural export. 73% received a bank loan, and only 18.2% had access to the Internet, but both of them yielded remarkable TFP values (18.5%, p < 0.01 and 3.4%, p < 0.05 respectively). The Hausman test indicated that the fixed effects (FE) model was more effective than the random effects (RE) model to estimate the TFP. The findings of this study suggested that reform efforts should focus on improving the productivity of small agricultural enterprises. In addition, foreign investment, effective use of bank loan and Internet accessibility should be further enhanced. The results of this study may provide insights for policymakers who aim to improve the productivity in agricultural enterprises and thereby contribute to the sustainable growth of the country. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Sector; Firm Productivity; Fixed Effects; Random Effects; Total Factor Productivity","","","","","Aker, Jenny C., Mobile phones and economic development in Africa, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24, 3, pp. 207-232, (2010); Anik, Asif Reza, Agricultural Productivity Growth and the Role of Capital in South Asia (1980-2013), Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 3, (2017); Gifted Kids or Pushy Parents Foreign Acquisitions and Plant Performance in Indonesia, (2005); Dias Ávila, Antônio Flávio, Chapter 72 Total Factor Productivity Growth in Agriculture.

The beams considered in this paper consists of three layers, a homogeneous ceramic core, and two functionally graded skin layers. Material properties of the skin layers are supposed to vary in both the thickness and length directions by power gradation laws. Based on a refined shear deformation beam theory, in which the transverse displacement is split into bending and shear parts, a novel finite element formulation is derived and employed in the analysis. Natural frequencies and dynamic response to a harmonic load of the beams with various boundary conditions are computed, and the influence of the material distribution and the layer thickness ratio on the vibration characteristics of the beams is highlighted. Numerical results reveal that the variation of the material properties in the longitudinal direction has a significant influence on the vibration behavior of the beams, and FGSW beams can be designed to achieve desired vibration characteristics by appropriate selection of material grading indexes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d-fgsw Beam; Finite Element Formulation; Refined Shear Deformation Theory; Vibration Analysis","","","","This work was supported by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant no. 107.02\u20132018.23.","Koizumi, Mitsue J., FGM activities in Japan, Composites Part B: Engineering, 28, 1-2, pp. 1-4, (1997); Pradhan, Suresh Chandra, Thermo-mechanical vibration of FGM sandwich beam under variable elastic foundations using differential quadrature method, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 321, 1-2, pp. 342-362, (2009); Chehel Amirani, Morteza, Free vibration analysis of sandwich beam with FG core using the element free Galerkin method, Composite Structures, 90, 3, pp. 373-379, (2009); Mashat, Daoud Suleiman, Free vibration of FGM layered beams by various theories and finite elements, Composites Part B: Engineering, 59, pp. 269-278, (2014); Bennai, Riadh, A new higher-order shear and normal deformation theory for functionally graded sandwich beams, Steel and Composite Structures, 19, 3, pp. 521-546, (2015); Vo, Thuc, Finite element model for vibration and buckling of functionally graded sandwich beams based on a refined shear deformation theory, Engineering Structures, 64, pp. 12-22, (2014); Vo, Thuc, A quasi-3D theory for vibration and buckling of functionally graded sandwich beams, Composite Structures, 119, pp. 1-12, (2015); Su, Zhu, A general Fourier formulation for vibration analysis of functionally graded sandwich beams with arbitrary boundary condition and resting on elastic foundations, Acta Mechanica, 227, 5, pp. 1493-1514, (2016); Şi̇mşek, Mesut, Bi-directional functionally graded materials (BDFGMs) for free and forced vibration of Timoshenko beams with various boundary conditions, Composite Structures, 133, pp. 968-978, (2015); Wang, Zhihai, Free vibration of two-directional functionally graded beams, Composite Structures, 135, pp. 191-198, (2016)","","Taiwan Association of Engineering and Technology Innovation","","","","","","25182994; 24150436","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116917814"

By applying a dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators, the results are robust to endogeneity issues and highlight the U-shaped nonlinear impact of firm risk on the non-executive director ratio. Besides, because the lack of information transparency in Vietnamese enterprises caused many risks for investors, the government issued the Circular 121/2012/TT-BTC dated July 26, 2012 on corporate governance applicable to public companies, which enhanced changes in the board structure of listed companies.

The focus is on the mediating effects of affective commitment and knowledge sharing within the relationship. Design/methodology: Data were collected in Vietnam via questionnaire survey. Regarding survey administration, first, we chose the five biggest universities, which specialized in economics and business in Hanoi. Then, from those universities, we randomly selected graduate classes whose students are fulltime employees in various companies around Hanoi. The questionnaire included 5 point Likert scale multi-items designed to measure factors. Among 750 distributed questionnaires, 252 were returned. After screening and deleting those questionnaires with missing information or those from large companies, 199 remained for further investigation, representing 26.53% of the valid response rate. The sample included 117 manufacturing and 82 non-manufacturing companies. For the statistical analysis of the data, we followed the three-step procedure of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling. Findings: Results support our hypotheses that predict positive mediating effects, except for the direct relationship between training and development as one aspect of internal CSR and affective commitment, although training and development have an indirect relationship with organizational creativity through knowledge sharing. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature on internal CSR, especially because it provides the valid empirical evidence for the relationship between internal CSR and organizational creativity, which needs more clarification regarding the process. We emphasize the importance of findings to the case of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, because they often face difficulties implementing external CSR due to resource constraints. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affective Commitment; Internal Csr; Knowledge Sharing; Organizational Creativity; Small And Medium-sized Enterprises; Vietnam","","","","","International Journal of Human and Social Sciences, (2010); Allen, Natalie J., The measurement and antecedents of affective, continuance and normative commitment to the organization, Journal of Occupational Psychology, 63, 1, pp. 1-18, (1990); Allen, Natalie J., Affective, continuance, and normative commitment to the organization: An examination of construct validity, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 49, 3, pp. 252-276, (1996); Research in Organizational Behavior, (1988); Amabile, Teresa M., The Creative Environment Scales: Work Environment Inventory, Creativity Research Journal, 2, 4, pp. 231-253, (1989); Amabile, Teresa M., Assessing the work environment for creativity, Academy of Management Journal, 39, 5, pp. 1154-1184, (1996); Hr Corporate Social Responsibility Using Csr to Enhance Employee Engagement and Deliver Hr Objectives, (2007); Bharadwaj, Sundar G., Making innovation happen in organizations: Individual creativity mechanisms, organizational creativity mechanisms or both?, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 17, 6, pp. 424-434, (2000); Morality Moral Behavior and Moral Development, (1984); Moral Development an Introduction, (1995)","","OmniaScience ic.editor@intangiblecapital.org ETSEIAT Building TR6C/ Colom 11, 3rd floor Terrassa 08222","","","","","","16979818; 20143214","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079908063"

After applying the fixed effects regressions and the extended instrumental variable regressions with fixed effects, we find that foreign ownership decreases the volatility of stock returns. However, the stabilizing impact of foreign ownership on stock return volatility becomes weaker in large firms since the coefficient of the interaction term between firm size and foreign ownership turns out to be significantly positive. The estimated results remain robust when we use the future one-year volatility, other than the current one, as an alternative measure of the dependent variable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Governance; Firm Size; Foreign Ownership; Volatility","","","","","Adams, Renée B., A theory of friendly boards, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 217-250, (2007); Bae, Kee Hong, Investibility and return volatility, Journal of Financial Economics, 71, 2, pp. 239-263, (2004); Bartram, Söhnke M., Why Are U.S. Stocks More Volatile?, Journal of Finance, 67, 4, pp. 1329-1370, (2012); Batten, Jonathan A., Foreign ownership in emerging stock markets, Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 32-33, pp. 15-24, (2015); Bohl, Martin T., Do institutional investors destabilize stock prices? evidence from an emerging market, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 16, 4, pp. 370-383, (2006); Regression Analysis by Example, (2000); Chen, Zhi'An, Does foreign institutional ownership increase return volatility?

This paper measures the volatility of market risk in Viet Nam hardware industry after this period (2015-2017). The main reason is the vital role of the software company group in Vietnam in the economic development and growth in recent years always go with risk potential and risk control policies. This research paper aims to figure out how much increase or decrease in the market risk of Vietnam hardware firms during the post-low inflation period 2015-2017. First, by using quantitative combined with comparative data analysis method, we find out the risk level measured by equity beta mean in the hardware industry is acceptable, i.e it is little lower than (<) 1. Then, one of its major findings is the comparison between risk level of hardware industry during the financial crisis 2007-2009 compared to those in the post-low inflation time 2015-2017. In fact, the research findings show us market risk fluctuation, measured by asset and equity beta var, during the post-low inflation time has increased considerably. Finally, this paper provides some ideas that could provide companies and government more evidence in establishing their policies in governance. This is the complex task but the research results shows us warning that the market risk volatility might be higher during the post-low inflation period 2015-2017. And our conclusion part will recommend some policies and plans to deal with it.

This article examines the views and experiences of local people in Cu Lao Cham MPA, Vietnam, with regard to tourism and poverty alleviation. Participant observation and semistructured interviews were conducted with 41 local people working in tourism. Results suggest that most respondents are involved in tourism and fishery simultaneously. Although tourism contributes significantly to respondents' living conditions and to the local economy overall (e.g., jobs creation for poor people and women), benefits are distributed unequally, which increases social conflicts. The challenges facing local people in participating in tourism include a lack of capital, lack of market access, and obstacles caused by local policies. This research suggests that locals' perceptions of tourism are important criteria for evaluating the tourism-poverty alleviation nexus. Additionally, in the context of MPAs, local attitudes may have an effect on conservation outcomes. Further research should consider the wider views of local people and other tourism stakeholders with regard to tourism, poverty, and conservation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cu Lao Cham; Marine Protected Areas (mpas); Perceived Tourism Benefits; Poverty Reduction; Pro-poor Tourism","","","","Funding text 1: The author would like to thank to Professor Carolin Funck from the Graduate School of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University, Japan and Dr. V.

It is located in the central province of Quang Nam, which is approximately 18 km offshore from Hoi An City (Fig. 1). There are four villages on the island consisting of about 2,500 people, with 600 households. In late 2005, Cu Lao Cham MPA was established under the authority of the Quang Nam Provincial People’s Committee (QNPPC) and was the outcome of the Cu Lao Cham MPA project, a livelihood support program that was funded by Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) (Brown, 2011). The primary objectives for establishing the MPA were to preserve the biodiversity value (i.e., protecting the fish and their ecosystem) and to improve the local livelihoods of Cu Lao Cham Island. Cu Lao Cham MPA covers an area of 6,710 ha and comprises both island nature reserve and protected marine waters (Nguyen, 2010). Due to its rich biodiversity value, in 2009 Cu Lao Cham was designated as UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve (WBR) (Nguyen, 2010).","Abdullah, Abdul Jabbar, Does education reduce income inequality?

Vietnam has made huge strides in economic growth within three decades of reforms, lifting millions of people out of poverty thanks to better access to credit. At the same time, there are lending and borrowing practices that signal troubles ahead. Based on a thorough examination of the theoretical literature on indebtedness, the study sets out to identify the drivers of borrowing and over-borrowing in Vietnam in recent years. Particularly, the abundant financial and physical resources have given rise to consumerism and the boom of the super-rich. These are two of the four factors that have shifted Vietnamese culture from one that traditionally condemned debt as a vice to one that now tolerates indebtedness. The other two factors can be found at the corporate level where there is an over-reliance on debt financing and rampant rent-seeking. Here, a kind of 'resource curse' threatens sustainable corporate growth - businesses rely too much on borrowing to fuel their operations, but in fact are overlooking the innovation factor. The new politics of debt, we suggest, have created a toxically pro-consumption, debt-tolerant society. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumerism; Corporate Debt; Culture Of Indebtedness; Emerging Market; Household Debt; Vietnam","","","","","Lessons Unlearned, (2017); Understanding the Macro Financial Effects of Household Debt A Global Perspective, (2018); American Economic Review, (1963); Barbier, Edward B., Debt, Poverty and Resource Management in a Rural Smallholder Economy, Environmental and Resource Economics, 63, 2, pp. 411-427, (2016); Barslund, Mikkel, Formal and informal rural credit in four provinces of Vietnam, Journal of Development Studies, 44, 4, pp. 485-503, (2008); Beeson, Mark, Developmentalism with Vietnamese Characteristics: The Persistence of State-led Development in East Asia, Journal of Contemporary Asia, 42, 4, pp. 539-559, (2012); Growing Up Fast Vietnam Discovers the Consumer Society; Real Estate Lending Risks Vietnam Investment Review, (2018); Growth and Vulnerabilities in Microfinance, (2010); What Drives Household Borrowing and Credit Constraints Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina, (2008)","","SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies","","","","","","1999253X; 19992521","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069806990"

Using the large panel data of the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Surveys, the objectives are twofold: (i) to evaluate the micro-impact of microcredit on rural household economy, particularly on output value and net income of rural households, using Matched Difference-in-Difference method; and (ii) to evaluate its macro-impact on economic growth, especially the aggregate effect of production increase and income growth, using Input–Output analysis. The results at micro level find that microcredit benefits self-employment rather than other economic activities of households. The salient results from the macro-economic analysis reveal that, not as expected, the effect of microcredit on output increase is not so large. The findings suggest that microcredit is an effective development strategy at both micro and macro levels, thus the Vietnamese government should enact the relevant policies to enhance the effectiveness and outreach of microcredit. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Growth; Input–output Analysis; Matched Difference-in-difference; Microcredit; Poverty Reduction","","","","The authors are grateful to the financial support by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.01-2018.18 .

The purpose of this work is to study the characteristic of variable polarity plasma arc pressure with different polarity time and find the key fact to achieve welding process stability and good quality welding joint in the flat position. The arc shape variation, arc pressure evolution and the molten pool behavior were observed and measured to discover the relationship to the weld joint formation. It was found that the small plasma arc pressure in the center with a similar affected region and enough upward shear force of arc plasma are the necessary conditions to get a stable keyhole process, which could drive the liquid metal of the back side weld pool converges at the bottom of the keyhole and flows upward and form a high-quality weld bead. Comparing the welding stability and quality, adjusting polarity time is the good method for completing the necessary conditions.

We develop, for the first time, two HC behavior models, which include households’ decisions to participate in a HC scheme and the level of HC participation. By applying Logit and Ordered logit models, a survey of 202 respondents in rural areas of Hoi An, Vietnam, indicates that households’ decisions to get involved in a HC scheme and the level of HC participation are affected by motivational factors such as knowledge about HC, attitude toward it, and owning a garden. We then explore the differences between the influencing factors for the two models. Interestingly, while participation in the HC training program influence the decision to participate in the HC scheme, the factor appears unimportant in increasing the level of HC practice. In addition, once the HC participation decision has been made, we find that pro-environmental behavior (such as habit of reusing plastic bags and reducing wastefulness) could promote a higher level of HC practice. These findings could help policy makers in promoting HC behavior to enhance a sustainable MOW management strategy at the household level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Home Composting; Pro-environmental Behavior; Pro-environmental Habit; Reducing Wastefulness; Reusing Plastic Bags; Developing Countries; Plastic Containers; Surveys; Waste Treatment; Wastes; Household Level; Management Strategies; Ordered Logit Model; Plastic Bags; Pro-environmental Behaviors; Pro-environmental Habit; Reducing Wastefulness; Training Program; Sustainable Development; Composting; Developing World; Municipal Solid Waste; Numerical Model; Participatory Approach; Sustainable Development; Waste Management; Adult; Article; Developing Country; Female; Household; Human; Human Experiment; Major Clinical Study; Male; Organic Waste; Rural Area; Training; Viet Nam; Hoi An","Developing countries; Plastic containers; Surveys; Waste treatment; Wastes; Household level; Management strategies; Ordered logit model; Plastic bags; Pro-environmental behaviors; Pro-environmental habit; Reducing wastefulness; Training program; Sustainable development; composting; developing world; municipal solid waste; numerical model; participatory approach; sustainable development; waste management; adult; article; developing country; female; household; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; organic waste; rural area; training; Viet Nam; Hoi An","","","We want to thank Dr. Premakumara Jagath Dickella Gamaralalage from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Japan, for his valuable advice.

This interdisciplinary study contributes to the literature through its application of Bayesian statistics in analyzing Vietnamese folklore. By breaking down 307 stories in popular Vietnamese folktales and major story collections and categorizing their core messages under the values or anti-values of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, the study shows how the Bayesian method helps discover an underlying behavioural phenomenon called “cultural additivity.” The term, which is inspired by the principle of additivity in probability, adds to the voluminous works on syncretism, creolization and hybridity in its technical dimension. Here, to evaluate how the values and norms of the aforementioned three religions (“tam giáo” 三教) co-exist, interact, and influence Vietnamese society, the study proposes three models of additivity for religious faiths: (a) no additivity, (b) simple additivity, and (c) complex additivity. The empirical results confirm the existence of “cultural additivity” : not only is there an isolation of Buddhism in the folktales, there is also a higher possibility of interaction or addition of Confucian and Taoist values even when these two religions hold different value systems (β <inf>{VT.VC}</inf> = 0.86). The arbitrary blend of the three religions is an example of the observed phenomenon of Vietnamese people selecting and adding ideas, beliefs, or artefacts—which may sometimes appear contradictory to principles of their existing beliefs—to their culture. The behavioural pattern is omnipresent in the sense that it can also be seen in Vietnamese arts, architecture, or adoption of new ideas and religions, among others. The “cultural additivity” concept, backed by robust statistical analysis, is an attempt to fill in the cultural core pointed out by syncretism and account for the rising complexity of modern societies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank research staff at Vuong & Associates for assistance in collecting and preparing dataset, particularly Dam Thu Ha and Nghiem Phu Kien Cuong.

This study uses data on propensity of general health exam (GHE) spending to show that despite the debate on the necessity of GHE, its objective is clear—to obtain more information and certainty about one’s health so as to minimise future risks. Most studies on this topic, however, focus only on factors associated with GHE uptake and overlook the shifts in behaviours and attitudes regarding different levels of cost. To fill the gap, this study analyses a dataset of 2068 subjects collected from Hanoi (Vietnam) and its vicinities using the baseline-category logit method. We evaluate the sensitivity of Vietnamese healthcare consumers against two groups of factors (demographic and socioeconomic-cognitive) regarding payment for periodic GHE, which is not covered by insurance. Our study shows that uninsured, married and employed individuals are less sensitive to cost than their counterparts because they value the information in reducing future health uncertainty. The empirical results challenge the objections to periodic health screening by highlighting its utility. The relevance of behavioural economics is further highlighted through a look at the bounded rationality of healthcare consumers and private insurance companies in using and providing the service, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Agborsangaya, Calypse B., Multimorbidity prevalence and patterns across socioeconomic determinants: a cross-sectional survey., BMC Public Health, 12, (2012); Agee, Mark D., Lessons from game theory about healthcare system price inflation: Evidence from a community-level case study, Applied Health Economics and Health Policy, 11, 1, pp. 45-51, (2013); Categorical Data Analysis, (2002); Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data, (1984); Becker, Marshall H., The Health Belief Model and Sick Role Behavior, Health Education and Behavior, 2, 4, pp. 409-419, (1977); Boulware, L.

Firstly, to describe the influence of cognitive styles on FSQ evaluation, we propose a quantitative hesitant fuzzy judgment description with an embedded assessing attitude. Next, an evaluation index system is established by combining the fundamental qualitative characteristics and the enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful financial information. Then, to overcome the weighting difficulties and achieve maximum consensus, this paper applies a distance-based method to determine the evaluators’ weights and a weighted averaging operator to compute the criteria weights. After that, a TOPSIS-based aggregation method is applied to aggregate all ratings. Finally, a practical example of an economic group’s FSQ evaluation is provided, and then this method is compared with other current methods to demonstrate its flexibility further. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assessing Attitude; Financial Statement Quality; Group Decision Making; Hesitant Fuzzy; Multi-criteria Decision Making; Weight Determination","","","","This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71601134]; the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2017M612983]; the Research Center for Systems Science & Enterprise Development [grant number Xq15C01].","Quality of Financial Reporting Measuring Qualitative Characteristics, (2009); Boschetti, Fabio, Assessing attitudes and cognitive styles of stakeholders in environmental projects involving computer modelling, Ecological Modelling, 247, pp. 98-111, (2012); Clatworthy, Mark A., The timeliness of UK private company financial reporting: Regulatory and economic influences, British Accounting Review, 48, 3, pp. 297-315, (2016); Dursun, Mehtap, A fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making framework for evaluating health-care waste disposal alternatives, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 9, pp. 11453-11462, (2011); Financial Accounting and Reporting, (2011); Feng, Bo, Multi-attribute group decision making with aspirations: A case study, Omega (United Kingdom), 44, pp. 136-147, (2014); Habib, Ahsan, Corporate governance and financial reporting quality in China: A survey of recent evidence, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 24, pp. 29-45, (2015); He, Xiaorong, Exploring the Ordered Weighted Averaging Operator Knowledge Domain: A Bibliometric Analysis, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 32, 11, pp. 1151-1166, (2017); Advances in Accounting Incorporating Advances in International Accounting; Iatridis, George Emmanuel, International Financial Reporting Standards and the quality of financial statement information, International Review of Financial Analysis, 19, 3, pp. 193-204, (2010)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","17509661; 17509653","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041823232"

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the collected data from the survey, the Money Laundering Risk Score (MLRS) is calculated for each customer who is using the services and products of Vietnamese commercial banks by the enhanced measurement model of Christopher Price, the ordinary least squares and three variations of logistic regression model. Findings: This paper proposes an appropriate estimation of the money laundering risk (MLR) for personal customer using the most significant factors that affects MLR and suggests practical recommendations for commercial banking system. Practical implications: This paper suggests an intuitive method to estimate the contribution of each customer factor on their MLRS. Originality/value: The higher respondent’s group of age lead to the higher MLR occurred in the financial market. Follow the works of Wolfsberg et al.

Export efficiency is defined as the ratio of actual exports to the maximum possible volume. In addition, the study investigates the impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and rules of origin on export efficiency, focusing on Vietnam's exports to its major trading partners during the period 1995–2013. The empirical results suggest that the volume of Vietnam's actual exports is far below the estimated efficient level, and that there is considerable room for increasing Vietnam's exports. Membership in ASEAN contributed positively to the country's trade efficiency while rules of origin and non-membership in EU and NAFTA had a negative impact. Those findings imply that Vietnam should enter more FTAs with trading partners and adopt lenient rules of origin in FTA negotiations; and that attracting export-oriented FDI and improving the mix of exports could enhance the country's trade efficiency substantially. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fta; Rules Of Origin; Trade Efficiency","","","","","Asia Pacific Economic Papers, (2007); Augier, Patricia, Rules of origin and the EU-Med partnership: The case of textiles, World Economy, 27, 9, pp. 1449-1473, (2004); Battese, George E., Frontier production functions, technical efficiency and panel data: With application to paddy farmers in India, Journal of Productivity Analysis, 3, 1-2, pp. 153-169, (1992); Brada, Josef C., Economic integration among developed, developing and centrally planned economies: a comparative analysis., Review of Economics and Statistics, 67, 4, pp. 549-556, (1985); Duttagupta, Rupa, Free trade areas and rules of origin: Economics and politics, Economics and Politics, 19, 2, pp. 169-190, (2007); Endoh, Masahiro, Trade creation and trade diversion in the EEC, the LAFTA and the CMEA: 1960-1994, Applied Economics, 31, 2, pp. 207-216, (1999); Rules of Origin in the World Trading System, (2003); Rules of Origin A World Map, (2003); undefined, (2009); Journal of World Trade, (2000)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","10490078","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040254239"

Economic feasibility of these alternatives can be assessed through life cycle costing, which is dependent on volatile parameters such as feedstock price, operating rate, capacity, interest rate and conversion efficiency. Uncertainty analysis is necessary to determine the robustness of the life cycle cost estimates. In this study, design of experiments was demonstrated to be an effective approach to analyze the sensitivity of life cycle cost to these parameters. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis can be done based not only on the individual effects, but also on the interactions of parameters. Data from the biodiesel program of Vietnam were used as a case study. The results show that operating cost and feedstock price have the most significant effects on biodiesel cost followed by capacity, interest rate and conversion efficiency. Interactions were observed between conversion efficiency and feedstock price; interest rate and operating rate; and feedstock price and interest rate. The regression equation obtained from sensitivity analysis shows that the cost of jatropha biodiesel is 0.72–1.02 US$/L, the cost of fish oil biodiesel is 0.45–0.87 US$/L, and the cost of waste cooking oil biodiesel is 0.42–0.61 US$/L. Although the framework developed in this study was used specifically in the life cycle costing of biodiesel, it can be readily applied to other low-carbon energy systems in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiesel; Design Of Experiments; Life Cycle Costing; Sensitivity Analysis; Uncertainty; Biodiesel; Conversion Efficiency; Cost Estimating; Design Of Experiments; Economic Analysis; Feedstocks; Life Cycle; Oils And Fats; Sensitivity Analysis; Uncertainty Analysis; Economic Feasibilities; Effective Approaches; Jatropha Biodiesels; Life Cycle Costing; Low-carbon Energy Systems; Regression Equation; Uncertainty; Waste Cooking Oil; Cost Benefit Analysis","Biodiesel; Conversion efficiency; Cost estimating; Design of experiments; Economic analysis; Feedstocks; Life cycle; Oils and fats; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Economic feasibilities; Effective approaches; Jatropha biodiesels; Life cycle costing; Low-carbon energy systems; Regression equation; Uncertainty; Waste cooking oil; Cost benefit analysis","","","Financial assistance from the ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asian Engineering Education Network (AUN/SEED-net) program of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is gratefully acknowledged.

The scoring is modeled as a learning to rank problem, which employs Ranking SVM to mutually exploits sentences, user-generated content, and third-party sources in the form of features to cover summary aspects. For the selection, summaries are extracted by using a score-based or voting method. For evaluation, three datasets of sentence and highlight extraction in two languages were taken as a case study. Experimental results indicate that by integrating user-generated content and third-party sources, our framework obtains improvements of ROUGE-scores over state-of-the-art methods for single-document summarization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Mining; Document Summarization; Information Retrieval; Learning To Rank; Social Context Summarization; Extraction; Information Retrieval; Search Engines; Document Summarization; Learning To Rank; Relevant Documents; Sentence Scoring; Single Document Summarization; Social Context; State-of-the-art Methods; User-generated Content; Data Mining","Extraction; Information retrieval; Search engines; Document summarization; Learning to rank; Relevant documents; Sentence scoring; Single document summarization; Social context; State-of-the-art methods; User-generated content; Data mining","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant number 15K16048 and Center for Research and Applications in Science and Technology, Hung Yen University of Technology and Education, under the grant number UTEHY.T026.P1718.04.

Since the amount of linked data is rapidly growing, it is important to automate this task. However, the difference between the schemata of source and target repositories remains a challenging barrier. This barrier reduces the portability, accuracy, and scalability of many proposed approaches. The authors present automatic schema-independent interlinking (ASL), which is a schema-independent system that performs instance matching on repositories with different schemata, without prior knowledge about the schemata. The key improvements of ASL compared to previous systems are the detection of useful attribute pairs for comparing instances, an attribute-driven token-based blocking scheme, and an effective modification of existing string similarities. To verify the performance of ASL, the authors conducted experiments on a large dataset containing 246 subsets with different schemata. The results show that ASL obtains high accuracy and significantly improves the quality of discovered coreferences against recently proposed complex systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Handling; Large Dataset; Data Repositories; High-accuracy; Independent Systems; Instance Matching; Prior Knowledge; String Similarity; Linked Data","Data handling; Large dataset; Data repositories; High-accuracy; Independent systems; Instance matching; Prior knowledge; String similarity; Linked data","","","","Araújo, Samur, SERIMI results for OAEI 2011, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 814, pp. 212-219, (2011); Webdb, (2012); Bhattacharya, Indrajit, Iterative record linkage for cleaning and integration, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 11-18, (2004); Bilenko, Mikhail, Adaptive blocking: Learning to scale up record linkage, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, pp. 87-96, (2006); Cruz, Isabel F., AgreementMaker: Efficient matching for large real-world schemas and ontologies, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2, 2, pp. 1586-1589, (2009); Dalvi, Nilesh N., Optimal hashing schemes for entity matching, pp. 295-305, (2013); Demartini, Gianluca, Large-scale linked data integration using probabilistic reasoning and crowdsourcing, VLDB Journal, 22, 5, pp. 665-687, (2013); Dong, Xin, Reference reconciliation in complex information spaces, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 85-96, (2005); Euzenat, Jérǒme, Final results of the ontology alignment evaluation initiative 2011, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 814, pp. 85-113, (2011); Ferrara, Alfio, Data linking for the semantic web, International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems, 7, 3, pp. 46-76, (2011)","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9781522551928; 1522551913; 9781522551911","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045857721"

Three variables proxy the impacts of information are prior knowledge, usage experience, and price. This study developed three pieces of advertised information and combined them with three levels of price to indicate the relevant information to diffuse at the introduction of a new brand. Three kinds of information include: (1) distinction information, which defines a new brand to be distinct from existing competitive brands; (2) differentiation information, which identifies a new brand to be different from one existing brand; (3) similarity information, which defines a new brand to be similar to one existing brand. The survey was conducted via direct interviews with 480 customers at the food outlets in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The ordered logit model was applied to examine the influence of each kind of information on consumer preferences for a new beef brand. The results indicated that (1) the effect of information on consumer adoption for a new brand at early stage depends on how that information defines the new brand in consumers’ perception; (2) the distinction information generates the highest economic added value; (3) the similarity information creates the information bias at introduction; (4) the usage experience can be diagnostic for the information bias. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand Differentiation; Brand Distinction; Brand Similarity; Information; Introduction Stage; Japanese Wagyu Beef; Prior Knowledge; Vietnam","","","","","Abernethy, Avery Mark, The information content of advertising: A meta-analysis, Journal of Advertising, 25, 2, pp. 1-17, (1996); Ackerberg, Daniel A., Advertising, learning, and consumer choice in experience good markets: An empirical examination, International Economic Review, 44, 3, pp. 1007-1040, (2003); Ackerberg, Daniel A., Empirically distinguishing informative and prestige effects of advertising, RAND Journal of Economics, 32, 2, pp. 316-333, (2001); Aertsens, Joris, Personal determinants of organic food consumption: A review, British Food Journal, 111, 10, pp. 1140-1167, (2009); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alba, Joseph W., Knowledge calibration: What consumers know and what they think they know, Journal of Consumer Research, 27, 2, pp. 123-156, (2000); Alfnes, Frode, Stated preferences for imported and hormone-treated beef: Application of a mixed logit model, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 31, 1, pp. 19-37, (2004); Ángulo, Ana María, Risk perception and consumer willingness to pay for certified beef in Spain, Food Quality and Preference, 18, 8, pp. 1106-1117, (2007); Baltas, George, Random utility models in marketing research: A survey, Journal of Business Research, 51, 2, pp. 115-125, (2001); Banović, Marija, Impact of Product Familiarity on Beef Quality Perception, Agribusiness, 28, 2, pp. 157-172, (2012)","","Sciendo","","","","","","20698887; 18420206","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064815439"

After testing the reliability and validity of each measurement scale, multiple regression analysis is utilised to test the relationship between supply chain management practices and operational capabilities. Analysis results indicate positive linkages between supply chain management practices on all aspects of manufacturing capabilities.

It investigates organizational variables such as organizational performance, previous employee performance, participative performance appraisal systems and leader power as the antecedents of perceived unfulfilled promises. It then examines whether perceived failure to fulfill contracts leads to the perception of PCB, and the possible moderating impacts of perceived self-fulfillment and individual differences on the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses cross-sectional design. Data have been collected from 364 full-time employees who enrolled in evening MBA courses in Vietnamese universities. Multiple regression and moderation analyses were used. Findings: Participative performance appraisal, past performance, perception of leader’s power and overall organizational performance influenced perceived failure to fulfill promises, which contributed to contract breach. Furthermore, perceived self-fulfillment, equity sensitivity and self-esteem moderated the relationship between perceived failure to fulfill promises and PCB. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of the study include a sampling technique which only focuses on MBA students, and cross-sectional research design. Practical implications: The study confirms the role of individual traits in the PCB development. Vietnamese companies should collect information concerning employees’ personalities to focus on fulfilling promises that matter most to each type of employees. Originality/value: The study distinguishes between perception of unmet promises and PCB. Furthermore, the moderating impacts of perceived self-fulfillment on the relationship between unmet promises and breach were examined. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Breach; Determinant; Moderators; Organizational Theory And Behaviour; Psychological Contract; Unfulfilled Promises; Vietnam","","","","","Journal of Organizational Behavior, (1998); Matthijs Bal, P.

The single models and k-means clustering are used to build the hybrid forecasting models in different levels of complexity (i.e. ARIMA; hybrid model of ARIMA and ANNs; and hybrid model of k-means, ARIMA, and ANN). To obtain the final forecasting value, the forecasted values of these three models are combined with the weights generated from the discount mean square forecast error (DMSFE) method. The proposed model is applied to three well-known data sets: Wolf's sunspot, Canadian lynx and the exchange rate (British pound to US dollar) to evaluate the prediction capability in three measures (i.e. MSE, MAE, and MAPE). In addition, the prediction performance of the proposed model is compared to ARIMA; ANNs; Khashei and Bijari's model; and the hybrid model of k-means, ARIMA, and ANN.

Understanding the role of the investment climate in generating firm productivity has received extensive attention by policymakers and economists in many countries. The article studies the effect of different dimensions of the investment climate on firm productivity. Using a large dataset of Vietnamese manufacturing firms, the article finds that deficiencies in the investment climate are prejudicial to firm productivity and competition. Furthermore, in examining the effect of corruption in association with the quality of the business environment, the study also investigates the possibility that corruption may compensate firms for a bad investment climate or at least may neutralize the negative impact of inefficient government regulations. In other words, corruption acts as ‘speed money’ to improve the efficacy of the provision of public services or provides leeway for entrepreneurs to bypass the inefficient regulations. This situation, however, is extremely harmful to the economy in the long run because it distorts the market and erodes the incentives for productive investments. Developing countries therefore need to put much more effort into institutional reforms, especially fighting corruption and efficiency in the provision of public goods and services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Regulation; Corruption; Firm Productivity; Investment Climate; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Vietnamese Manufacturing Firm; Business; Competition (economics); Corruption; Entrepreneur; Investment; Manufacturing; Public Service; Stochasticity; Viet Nam","business; competition (economics); corruption; entrepreneur; investment; manufacturing; public service; stochasticity; Viet Nam","","","","Acemoglu, Daron, Property rights, corruption and the allocation of talent: A general equilibrium approach, Economic Journal, 108, 450, pp. 1381-1403, (1998); Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Aterido, Reyes, Big constraints to small firms' growth?

The Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model was used to assess seven scenarios having the same socioeconomic development but different shares of RE in power generation. By comparing different relative reductions caused by the emission constraints vis-a-vis the business-as-usual (BaU) scenario, the mitigation costs can be estimated. Results show that the economic impact could be reduced by around 55% in terms of welfare loss (from 6.0 to 2.7%) and by around 36% in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) loss (from 3.4 to 2.1%) through the incorporation of high levels of renewable energy. Furthermore, the additional double deployment of wind and SPV to 5.4% and 12.0%, respectively, which currently comprise 43.1% of the renewable energies used in electricity generation, could reduce the GDP loss from 2.1 to 1.9% and reduce the welfare loss from 2.7 to 1.5% in order to achieve a 25.0% GHG emissions reduction.

As the severe scarcity of water resources because of climate change, water conservation through efficient irrigation has turned into a vital strategy for tea sector in solving this rising challenge. This paper analyzes irrigation water use efficiency of small-scale tea farms in Vietnam and identifies its determinants applying stochastic frontier analysis. Results showed that under decreasing returns to scale, the mean irrigation water use efficiency was 42.19 %, indicating the existence of substantial water waste. If farmers become more efficient in using water, saving 57.81 % of irrigation water is possible unaccompanied by reducing the observed output. The factors affecting tea farms’ irrigation water use efficiency were investigated by Tobit model. Gender, water shortage awareness, soil and water conservation practice, off-farm income share, extension services access and well water utilization showed significant influence on the efficiency of irrigation water.

The mining sector is remarkably significant to the development of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region, because the majority of global trade and investment in this region depends on this sector. Therefore, the assessment of mining sector sustainability at national and global scales in APEC economies is an important task. So far, however, mining sector sustainability assessment frameworks have only been developed at small scales, such as companies and cities. In this study, therefore, it is proposed an indicator-based sustainability assessment framework (iSAF) to assess mining sector sustainability at national and global scales. In this framework, fuzzy logic was utilized to adequately deal with the uncertainty and vagueness of human expressions. The conventional fuzzy scales were suitably modified in the proposed framework to facilitate confident decision-making by the relevant stakeholders. In order to avoid repeatedly conducting the judgment until the acceptable consistency was obtained, iSAF implemented an innovative theory to deal with unacceptable consistencies in judgment. The proposed iSAF was applied to the mining sector of APEC economies using data from the APEC 2010 Project. As for the results, three important criteria including economic, environmental, and social criteria and twenty significant indicators were appropriately selected to cover the actual situation in the sector. The results showed that iSAF was a suitable framework for preventing uncertainty and vagueness in decision-making. iSAF was found to provide crucial support to decision-makers, not only in identifying and structuring the main components contributing to sustainability, but also in pointing out the factors in which significant investment should be made to effectively improve sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahp; Apec; Fuzzy Logic; Mining Sector; Sustainability Assessment Framework; Computer Circuits; Decision Making; Economics; Fuzzy Logic; Mining; Network Function Virtualization; Apec; Decision Makers; Economic Co-operation; Global Scale; Global Trade; Industrial Sector; Mining Sector; Sustainability Assessment; Sustainable Development; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; Decision Making; Developing World; Environmental Economics; Fuzzy Mathematics; Mining Industry; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim","Computer circuits; Decision making; Economics; Fuzzy logic; Mining; Network function virtualization; APEC; Decision makers; Economic Co-operation; Global scale; Global trade; Industrial sector; Mining sector; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; decision making; developing world; environmental economics; fuzzy mathematics; mining industry; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim","","","","Int J Appl Math Inform, (2012); Azapagic, Adisa, Developing a framework for sustainable development indicators for the mining and minerals industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 12, 6, pp. 639-662, (2004); Azapagic, Adisa, Indicators of sustainable development for industry: A general framework, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 78, 4, pp. 243-261, (2000); Biju, P.

For large datasets, NMF performance depends on some major issues such as fast algorithms, fully parallel distributed feasibility and limited internal memory. This research designs a fast fully parallel and distributed algorithm using limited internal memory to reach high NMF performance for large datasets. Specially, we propose a flexible accelerated algorithm for NMF with all its L<inf>1</inf>L<inf>2</inf> regularized variants based on full decomposition, which is a combination of exact line search, greedy coordinate descent, and accelerated search. The proposed algorithm takes advantages of these algorithms to converges linearly at an over-bounded rate (1-μL)(1-μrL)2r in optimizing each factor matrix when fixing the other factor one in the sub-space of passive variables, where r is the number of latent components, and μ and L are bounded as 12≤μ≤L≤r.

By 2016, it has singed 12 FTAs, of which eight have already become operational, and is negotiating another four for formation. With this FTA endeavour, Vietnam is set to emerge as an FTA hub along with Singapore and Thailand in the South East Asian region. In selecting partners and signing FTAs, Vietnam maintains a distinct economic and political strategy. The participation in older and new-generation FTAs has brought both opportunities and challenges to Vietnam.

A qualitative comparative analysis method was used to determine which conditions or combinations of conditions led to or prevented a forest transition. Under the condition of public ownership with no private forest tenure or ownership of forest land, there was no instance of forest transition among the nine countries studied. Under the condition of non-liberal timber trade policies, there was no instance of forest transition in the countries studied. The results of this analysis suggest that for a forest transition to occur, the country should liberalize timber import and provide forest tenure to the private sector. Based on these results, we argue that in order for a forest transition to take place or for REDD + to be effective, the state should allow for private sector to participate in forest management and create market conditions that meet the demand for timber via trade policy alignment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Enabling Conditions; Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Commerce; Timber; Asia; Enabling Conditions; Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Forestry","Commerce; Timber; Asia; Enabling conditions; Forest policy; Forest transition; Qualitative comparative analysis; Forestry","","","This paper is based on a study conducted as a cooperative research within the project “Comparative Analyses of Transition to Sustainable Forest Management and Rehabilitation” carried out by APAFRI with financial support from the Asia-Pacific Network for Sustainable Forest Management and Rehabilitation (2011P6/6-APAFRI) and supported by the Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences of Seoul National University and Korea Forest Service's forest carbon sink graduate program.

The former puts more emphasis on local initiatives and the latter emphasizes the role of the government in forest transition. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between the two pathways. Based on a particular case study from Vietnam, we analyze historical forest transition data generated from remote sensing imageries and field research during the period from the 1950s until 2008. As a result, we found that after 1989 the forest area in the study area recovered and smallholder played an important role in forest transition. However, they did not engage in reforestation activities on their own. Rather, government support, technical expertise, a tree processing facility, traders and a research institute all supported reforestation. This broader institutional support from government and the private sector was important next to farmer driven reforestation to explain forest transition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Institutional Support; Smallholder; Vietnam; Agriculture; Reforestation; Remote Sensing; Forest Policy; Forest Transition; Institutional Support; Smallholder; Viet Nam; Forestry","Agriculture; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Forest policy; Forest transition; Institutional support; Smallholder; Viet Nam; Forestry","","","","A SIDA Evaluation Report, (1999); Socioeconomic Renovation in Viet Nam the Origin Evolution and Impact of Doi Moi, (2000); Doi Moi in the Mountains Land Use Changes and Farmers Livelihood Strategies in Bac Kan Province Vietnam, (2002); Castella, Jean Christophe, Impact of forestland allocation on land use in a mountainous province of Vietnam, Land Use Policy, 23, 2, pp. 147-160, (2006); Clement, Floriane, Afforestation and forestry land allocation in northern Vietnam: Analysing the gap between policy intentions and outcomes, Land Use Policy, 26, 2, pp. 458-470, (2009); Red Books Green Hills the Impact of Economic Reform on Restoration Ecology in the Midlands of Northern Vietnam, (1996); Gomiero, Tiziano, Vietnamese uplands: Environmental and socio-economic perspective of forest land allocation and deforestation process, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 2, 2, pp. 119-142, (2000); A Leap of Faith A Story of the Swedish Aid and Paper Production in Vietnam the Bai Bang Project 1969 1996, (1999); Mather, Alexander S., The forest transition, Area, 24, 4, pp. 367-379, (1992); Mather, Alexander S., Recent Asian forest transitions in relation to foresttransition theory, International Forestry Review, 9, 1, pp. 491-502, (2007)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13899341","","FPEOA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992225476"

The first objective of the study is to compare the perceptions of the three groups of respondents, including first- and fourth-year accounting students and practising accountants. It was revealed that the respondents' perceptions differed in 12 out of the 17 traits of accountants, and four out of the six characteristics of accounting. Fourth year students held the least favourable images, while practitioners were the most positive evaluators. The images of the accountants were positively perceived, while those of the accounting profession only received neutral evaluations. The second objective of the study is to verify the relationships between perceptions of accountants/accounting and other demographic and attitudinal variables. Using the data gathered from the practising accountant sample, the analysis revealed that the respondents' perceptions could be significantly affected by their sex, education and position on the one hand, and could significantly influence their intention on the other.

However, the results of LCA can be affected by parameter uncertainties. The rigorous treatment of such uncertainties is thus essential to improve decision-making based on the LCA. In this work, the Latin hypercube design of experiments (DOE) approach is proposed for global sensitivity analysis in LCA. In this novel approach, the LCA input parameters are used as the factors for the experimental design. The LCA of biodiesel from different feedstocks, namely, jatropha, waste cooking oil (WCO), and fish oil (FO), under the current conditions in Vietnam was chosen as a test case. The LCA focuses on the global warming potential (GWP), photochemical ozone formation potential (POFP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) of the biodiesel system. These impact categories were then combined into an overall environmental impact (OEI) score using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The effect of changes in the LCA model parameters on the OEI was then observed through computational experiments using a Latin hypercube design. From the computational experiments, the input parameters significantly affecting the results of LCA were identified, and a proxy polynomial regression model was derived to enable global sensitivity analysis to be performed. The results show that agricultural yield, oil content of jatropha seed, transesterification yield, total transportation, and biodiesel blending fraction are the factors that have significant effects on the OEI of jatropha biodiesel; biodiesel blend fraction and total transportation are significant in the case of WCO diesel, while the only significant effect factor in FO biodiesel case is biodiesel blend fraction. Biodiesel blend fraction is the most significant parameter for all feedstocks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiesel; Design Of Experiments; Latin Hypercube Sampling; Life Cycle Assessment; Sensitivity Analysis; Vietnam; Fish Oil; Agricultural Robots; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Biodiesel; Blending; Decision Making; Design Of Experiments; Ecodesign; Environmental Impact; Eutrophication; Feedstocks; Fossil Fuels; Geometry; Global Warming; Oils And Fats; Petroleum Transportation; Polynomial Regression; Sensitivity Analysis; Alternative To Fossil Fuels; Analytic Hierarchy Process (ahp); Eutrophication Potentials; Global Sensitivity Analysis; Latin Hypercube Sampling; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Polynomial Regression Models; Viet Nam; Life Cycle; Biodiesel; Fish Oil; Oil; Unclassified Drug; Waste Cooking Oil; Biofuel; Environmental Impact Assessment; Experimental Design; Fossil Fuel; Life Cycle Analysis; Sampling; Sensitivity Analysis; Acidification Potential; Agricultural Parameters; Agricultural Yield; Analysis; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Article; Biodiesel Blending Fraction; Chemical Parameters; Controlled Study; Environmental Factor; Environmental Impact; Eutrophication Potential; Global Sensitivity Analysis; Global Warming Potential; Jatropha; Life Cycle Assessment; Mathematical Computing; Mathematical Model; Overall Environmental Impact; Photochemical Ozone Formation Potential; Plant Seed; Proxy Polynomial Regression Model; Transesterification","Agricultural robots; Analytic hierarchy process; Biodiesel; Blending; Decision making; Design of experiments; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Geometry; Global warming; Oils and fats; Petroleum transportation; Polynomial regression; Sensitivity analysis; Alternative to fossil fuels; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Eutrophication potentials; Global sensitivity analysis; Latin hypercube sampling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Polynomial regression models; Viet Nam; Life cycle; biodiesel; fish oil; oil; unclassified drug; waste cooking oil; biofuel; environmental impact assessment; experimental design; fossil fuel; life cycle analysis; sampling; sensitivity analysis; acidification potential; agricultural parameters; agricultural yield; analysis; analytic hierarchy process; Article; biodiesel blending fraction; chemical parameters; controlled study; environmental factor; environmental impact; eutrophication potential; global sensitivity analysis; global warming potential; Jatropha; life cycle assessment; mathematical computing; mathematical model; overall environmental impact; photochemical ozone formation potential; plant seed; proxy polynomial regression model; transesterification","","fish oil, 308064-99-5, 8016-13-5","","Aczél, János A., Procedures for synthesizing ratio judgements, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 27, 1, pp. 93-102, (1983); Ahlroth, Sofia, Weighting and valuation in selected environmental systems analysis tools - Suggestions for further developments, Journal of Cleaner Production, 19, 2-3, pp. 145-156, (2011); Byun, Myung-woo, Physicochemical properties of soybean oil extracted from γ-irradiated soybeans, Radiation Physics and Chemistry, 46, 4-6 PART 1, pp. 659-662, (1995); Caldeira, C., Incorporating uncertainty in the life cycle assessment of biodiesel from waste cooking oil addressing different collection systems, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 112, pp. 83-92, (2016); Chevalier, Jean Luc, Life cycle analysis with ill-defined data and its application to building products, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 1, 2, pp. 90-96, (1996); Ciroth, Andreas, Uncertainty calculation in life cycle assessments: A combined model of simulation and approximation, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 9, 4, pp. 216-226, (2004); Crabbe, Edward, Biodiesel production from crude palm oil and evaluation of butanol extraction and fuel properties, Process Biochemistry, 37, 1, pp. 65-71, (2001); Daniel, Stavros E., Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods, Ecological Indicators, 4, 2, pp. 125-138, (2004); Evn Report 2015 Annual Electricity Report of Vietnam Electricity Corporation; Fazeni-Fraisl, Karin, Methodological advancements in Life Cycle Process Design: A preliminary outlook, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 92, pp. 66-77, (2014)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09213449; 18790658","","RCREE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027918544"

However, this traffic may significantly contend network resources with foreground (FG) traffic which conveys data/content to users. This contention directly affects the QoS and QoE of network services, specifically at the peak times. This paper proposes an integration approach to which delay-insensitive traffic is quickly detected and effectively transferred in accordance with the network conditions hence the best resources are yielded to FG traffic. For the traffic transferring, we propose two methods namely the router centric (RC) and the SDN-based approaches. In the RC method, the edge routers analyze network conditions, compute the suggested sending rates for individual traffic flows and send these values back to clients where the adjustment mechanisms are implemented. In the SDN-based method the course of actions for each traffic flow is computed by a remote controller. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Pollution Control; Quality Of Service; Remote Control; Adjustment Mechanisms; Individual Traffic; Integration Approach; Network Condition; Remote Controllers; System On Devices; Traffic Detection; Traffic Transferring; Routers","Pollution control; Quality of service; Remote control; Adjustment mechanisms; Individual traffic; Integration approach; Network condition; Remote controllers; System on Devices; Traffic detection; Traffic transferring; Routers","","","","Karla, Pramukh R., Identification of class of services in the Internet and a proposed approach to traffic prioritization at layer 3, Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON, (2012); Zhang, Jun, Internet traffic classification by aggregating correlated naive bayes predictions, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 8, 1, pp. 5-15, (2013); Zhang, Jun, Robust Network Traffic Classification, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 23, 4, pp. 1257-1270, (2015); Su, Kai, On the benefit of information centric networks for traffic engineering, pp. 3178-3184, (2014); Gobriel, Sameh, When idle is not quiet: Energy-efficient platform design in presence of network background and management traffic, (2010); Meng, Lei, Characterizing the utility of smartphone background traffic, Proceedings - International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, ICCCN, (2014); Tran-Minh, Quang, Separation of background and foreground traffic based on periodicity analysis, Proceedings - IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM, (2015); Low Extra Delay Background Transport Ledbat, (2012); Konda, Vishnu, RAPID: Shrinking the congestion-control timescale, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 1-9, (2009); Tsugawa, Tomoaki, Background TCP data transfer with Inline network measurement, 2005, pp. 459-463, (2005)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEICE ICM; KICS KNOM","18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium, APNOMS 2016","","Kanazawa; Kanazawa Chamber of Commerce and Industry","124900","","9784885523045","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006375008"

Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) produced from J. curcas seeds contains toxic phorbol esters that can cause cancer. The behaviors of toxic phorbol esters were investigated during BDF production. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and photodiode array analyses revealed that the phorbol esters contained in JCO had a tigliane skeleton. The partition coefficients of phorbol esters between methanol (MeOH) and the oil (K<inf>MeOH/oil</inf>) ranged from 2.4 to 20. As a result, the phorbol esters in the JCO were largely partitioned into the MeOH phase. The phorbol esters in the oil were converted stoichiometrically into phorbol and the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters via a transesterification reaction in a potassium hydroxide (KOH)/methanol (MeOH) solution. The phorbol produced predominantly partitioned into the glycerin phase. A small amount of phorbol residue contained in the BDF could be removed by washing with water. These results suggest that it is safe to use BDF produced by the aforementioned transesterification reaction and purification process. However, phorbol contamination of glycerin and wastewater from the production process should not be ignored. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Jatropha Curcas Oil (jco); Participation; Phorbol; Phorbol Esters; Transesterification; Biodiesel; Fatty Acids; Fossil Fuel Deposits; Fossil Fuels; Glycerol; Liquid Chromatography; Mass Spectrometry; Potassium Hydroxide; Transesterification; Fatty Acid Methyl Ester; Jatropha Curcas Oil; Participation; Partition Coefficient; Phorbol; Phorbol Esters; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Transesterification Reaction; Esters","Biodiesel; Fatty acids; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Glycerol; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Potassium hydroxide; Transesterification; Fatty acid methyl ester; Jatropha Curcas oil; Participation; Partition coefficient; Phorbol; Phorbol esters; Tandem mass spectrometry; Transesterification reaction; Esters","","","The authors thank the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for their support of the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) project titled “Multi-Beneficial Measure for Mitigation of Climate Change in Vietnam and Indochina Countries by the Cultivation-Production-Utilization of Biomass Energy.”","Ahmed, Waled Abdo, Phorbol ester as toxic constituents of tropical Jatropha curcas seed oil, European Journal of Scientific Research, 31, 3, pp. 429-436, (2009); Berchmans, Hanny Johanes, Biodiesel production from crude Jatropha curcas L. seed oil with a high content of free fatty acids, Bioresource Technology, 99, 6, pp. 1716-1721, (2008); Caetano, Nídia S., Spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production and other applications, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 16, 7, pp. 1423-1430, (2014); Chakraborty, Rajat, Optimization of biodiesel production from Indian mustard oil by biological tri-calcium phosphate catalyst derived from Turkey bone ash, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 17, 2, pp. 455-463, (2015); Analytical Chemistry, (1994); Fatt Chuah, Lai Fatt, Performance and emission of diesel engine fuelled by waste cooking oil methyl ester derived from palm olein using hydrodynamic cavitation, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 17, 8, pp. 2229-2241, (2015); Delavari, Armin, Continuous biodiesel production in a helicoidal reactor using ultrasound-assisted transesterification reaction of waste cooking oil, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 17, 1, pp. 273-279, (2015); Devappa, Rakshit Kodekalra, Biodegradation of Jatropha curcas phorbol esters in soil, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 90, 12, pp. 2090-2097, (2010); Dimitrijević, Saša M., Analysis and purification of phorbol esters using normal phase HPLC and photodiode-array detection, Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis, 15, 3, pp. 393-401, (1996); Freedman, Bernard, Variables affecting the yields of fatty esters from transesterified vegetable oils, JAOCS, Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society, 61, 10, pp. 1638-1643, (1984)","","Springer Verlag","","","","","","1618954X; 16189558","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961843591"

This study offers findings that illustrate the differences in perception of destination image, satisfaction attributes, and intention among domestic and international visitors to Ha Long Bay, a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site in Vietnam. The results of a survey on 650 tourists suggest that international visitors to the Ha Long Bay region have higher standards and are more critical in their evaluation of services than domestic visitors when judging this destination.

The emitted biogas comprised 57.7%-60.8% methane, 14.5%-31.5% carbon dioxide, 10.8%-24.7% nitrogen, and 329-423 ppm of nitrous oxide. In the OAS, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) degraded as the methane emission rate increased from influent to effluent. Finally, 94.4% of the total COD was removed. More than 90% of the removed COD converted to methane. Methane emitted from the bottom and the wall surface of the OAS. Methane-producing bacteria was detected by a cloning analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. The predominant species differed depending on the degradation characteristics of the RSS wastewater in the OAS. The emission rate of methane and nitrous oxide ranged between 2.58 and 8.85 NL/(m2 hr) and between 0.074 and 0.410 NL/(m2/hr), respectively. Moreover, 0.153 t-CO<inf>2eq</inf> of GHGs were emitted from 1 m3 of RSS wastewater treatment. Nitrous oxide accounted for 65% of the total GHGs emissions because of its high global warming potential. Therefore, both nitrous oxide and methane that emitted from the treatment of wastewater from a natural rubber processing factory must be considered as significant contributors to the GHGs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ghgs Emissions; Methane; Natural Rubber Processing Wastewater; Nitrous Oxide; Open-type Anaerobic System; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Data Storage Equipment; Effluents; Gas Emissions; Global Warming; Methane; Nitrogen Oxides; Rna; Rubber; Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Systems; Anaerobic Waste Water Treatment; Degradation Characteristics; Ghgs Emissions; Global Warming Potential; Methane Producing Bacteria; Nitrous Oxide; Rubber Processing; Greenhouse Gases","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Data storage equipment; Effluents; Gas emissions; Global warming; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; RNA; Rubber; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic systems; Anaerobic waste water treatment; Degradation characteristics; GHGs emissions; Global warming potential; Methane producing bacteria; Nitrous oxide; Rubber processing; Greenhouse gases","","","","Anotai, Jin, Integrated treatment scheme for rubber thread wastewater: Sulfide precipitation and biological processes, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 141, 1, pp. 1-7, (2007); Boonsawang, Piyarat, Enhancement of sludge granulation in anaerobic treatment of concentrated latex wastewater, Songklanakarin Journal of Science and Technology, 30, SUPPL. 1, pp. 111-119, (2008); Chaiprapat, Sumate S., Effects of wastewater recycling from natural rubber smoked sheet production on economic crops in southern Thailand, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 51, 3, pp. 577-590, (2007); Chaiprapat, Sumate S., Evaluating sulfuric acid reduction, substitution, and recovery to improve environmental performance and biogas productivity in rubber latex industry, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 94, C, pp. 420-429, (2015); Daelman, Matthijs R.J., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from municipal wastewater treatment - Results from a long-term study, Water Science and Technology, 67, 10, pp. 2350-2355, (2013); Foley, Jeffrey M., Nitrous oxide generation in full-scale biological nutrient removal wastewater treatment plants, Water Research, 44, 3, pp. 831-844, (2010); Hatamoto, M., Rubber and methane recovery from deproteinized natural rubber wastewater by coagulation pre-treatment and anaerobic treatment, International Journal of Environmental Research, 6, 3, pp. 577-584, (2012); Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing, (2007); 2006 Ipcc Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, (2006); Jawjit, Warit, Evaluating environmental performance of concentrated latex production in Thailand, Journal of Cleaner Production, 98, pp. 84-91, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969327003"

These innovation activities create value and competitive advantages for successful organizations; therefore, understanding the organization’s overall innovation is the first and foremost to understand the role of innovation on firm performance. The objective of this research is to explore two parts: the impacts of innovation on the different aspect of innovation performance, then their effects to firm performance (production, market, and financial performance). Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data from questionnaire survey. The questionnaire involves 4 parts including general information, innovation activities; innovative performance, and firm performance. This research focuses on firms in supporting industries of mechanics, electronics, motorbike and automobile. These firms are in a list of companies (known as The Excellent Vietnamese Companies in Northern and Central Vietnam) established by JETRO and VCCI. There are 150 firms in this list. The questionnaire survey was administered to directors, CEO of those firms during April and May, 2014. Out of the 150 questionnaires sent out, 118 were valid, accounting for 78.7% of the true response rate. Analysis methodologies of reliability, factor analysis and regression are utilized in this paper. Findings: The result demonstrated there are positive effects of process, marketing, and organizational innovations on firm performance in supporting firms. More specifically, the higher the level of innovation activities is, the greater the innovative performance is, which means the larger level of Process, organization and marketing innovation activities are, the higher level of innovative performance are likely to be. Secondly, the higher level of Process, organization and marketing innovative performance, the better level of firm performances is likely to be. To sum up, in order to improve the innovative and firm performance, those firms in supporting industry should highly concentrate on process, marketing, and organizational innovation activities, rather than product innovation activities. Originality/value: Initially, this study applies successfully the model which supposing innovation is a process, then clarifying innovation definition through the impact of innovation activities on innovative performances. Secondly, this research confirmed the positive impact of innovative performances on firm performances. It provided one more empirical evidence of the relationship between innovation and firm performance. For practitioners, organizational innovation and process innovation are more important factors affecting innovative performance and firm performance than product and marketing innovation. Therefore, enterprises should focus and mobilize resources to create improvement in organizational structure and manufacturing processes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Firm Performance; Innovation; Innovative Performance; Manufacturing Firm","","","","","Amara, Nabil, Sources of information as determinants of novelty of innovation in manufacturing firms: Evidence from the 1999 statistics Canada innovation survey, Technovation, 25, 3, pp. 245-259, (2005); Bartel, Caroline A., The role of narratives in sustaining organizational innovation, Organization Science, 20, 1, pp. 107-117, (2009); Bell, Geoffrey G., Clusters, networks, and firm innovativeness, Strategic Management Journal, 26, 3, pp. 287-295, (2005); Cho, Hee-jae, Relationship between innovativeness, quality, growth, profitability, and market value, Strategic Management Journal, 26, 6, pp. 555-575, (2005); Damanpour, Fariborz, Organizational complexity and innovation: Developing and testing multiple contingency models, Management Science, 42, 5, pp. 693-716, (1996); Marketing Bulletin, (1999); Overview of Factor Analysis, (1998); Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practice and Principles, (1985); Oxford Handbook of Innovation, (2005); Academy of Management Review, (1996)","","Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya editor@jiem.org","","","","","","20138423; 20130953","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006043686"

To enable genetic manipulation of the genome, we constructed an infectious cDNA clone of OKV. RNA synthesized in vitro from pFBOKV, a full-length OKV cDNA, in the presence or absence of cap analogue produced infectious progeny viruses effectively in mosquito C6/36 cells. Subsequently, ORF3 in pFBOKV was replaced with a GFP coding sequence to generate a construct designated as pO2GFP. C6/36 cells transfected with pO2GFP-derived RNA successfully expressed GFP, but failed to produce progeny viruses. Co-transfection of C6/36 cells with pO2GFP- and pFBOKV-derived RNA revealed that it is possible to produce infectious pO2GFP-derived progeny viruses by supplying OKV genetic elements and/or gene product deleted in pO2GFP even though the infectivity appeared to be low. Although improvements are required to construct viral vectors that propagate more efficiently, this is, to our knowledge, the first report of construction of a negevirus-based foreign gene expression system. The cDNA clones constructed and biological insights obtained in this study will be powerful tools allowing for reverse genetics of OKV and providing a basis to develop efficient negevirus-based expression vector systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Infectious Clone; Negevirus; Okushiri Virus; Viral Expression Vector; Cloning; Genes; Molecular Biology; Rna; Viruses; Biological Insight; Co-transfections; Coding Sequences; Expression Vectors; Genetic Elements; Genetic Manipulations; Negevirus; Viral Expression Vector; Gene Expression","Cloning; Genes; Molecular biology; RNA; Viruses; Biological insight; Co-transfections; Coding sequences; Expression vectors; Genetic elements; Genetic manipulations; Negevirus; Viral expression vector; Gene expression","","","","Auguste, Albert Jonathan, Characterization of a novel Negevirus and a novel Bunyavirus isolated from Culex (Culex) declarator mosquitoes in Trinidad, Journal of General Virology, 95, PART 2, pp. 481-485, (2014); Carapeta, Sara, Negeviruses found in multiple species of mosquitoes from southern Portugal: Isolation, genetic diversity, and replication in insect cell culture, Virology, 483, pp. 318-328, (2015); Corver, Jeroen, Fine mapping of a cis-acting sequence element in yellow fever virus RNA that is required for RNA replication and cyclization, Journal of Virology, 77, 3, pp. 2265-2270, (2003); Flotte, Terence R., An improved system for packaging recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors capable of in vivo transduction, Gene Therapy, 2, 1, pp. 29-37, (1995); Gorchakov, Rodion V., Generation of an infectious Negev virus cDNA clone, Journal of General Virology, 95, PART 9, pp. 2071-2074, (2014); Ishikawa, Tomohiro, Construction of an infectious molecular clone of Japanese encephalitis virus genotype V and its derivative subgenomic replicon capable of expressing a foreign gene, Virus Research, 195, pp. 153-161, (2015); Kallies, René, Genetic characterization of goutanap virus, a novel virus related to negeviruses, cileviruses and higreviruses, Viruses, 6, 11, pp. 4346-4357, (2014); Kawakami, Kota, Characterization of a novel negevirus isolated from Aedes larvae collected in a subarctic region of Japan, Archives of Virology, 161, 4, pp. 801-809, (2016); Liljeström, Peter T., A new generation of animal cell expression vectors based on the semliki forest virus replicon, Bio/Technology, 9, 12, pp. 1356-1361, (1991); Lo, Michael K., Functional analysis of mosquito-borne flavivirus conserved sequence elements within 3′ untranslated region of West Nile virus by use of a reporting replicon that differentiates between viral translation and RNA replication, Journal of Virology, 77, 18, pp. 10004-10014, (2003)","","Japanese Society of Sericultural Sciences jsss@silk.or.jp","","","","","","13468073; 18847978","","NISZA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991669714"

Decision-makers face challenges in crafting a long-term policy for sustainable development of biodiesel that balances social, technological, economic and environmental aspects. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied in this study to find the most appropriate feedstock for biodiesel production in Vietnam among three possible options: jatropha oil, fish fat and waste cooking oil. The judgments of different Vietnamese stakeholders, such as academics, heads of biodiesel projects, managers in Petrovietnam Corporation, and engineers were incorporated. The stakeholders showed different preferences as reflected in the priority weights of criteria and alternatives. The priority weights of alternatives under the judgments of multiple stakeholders indicate that waste cooking oil is the most preferred feedstock to produce biodiesel in Vietnam followed by jatropha oil and fish fat. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahp; Alternative Feedstock; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Biodiesel; Fish Fat; Jatropha; Mcda; Multi-criteria Decision Analysis; Vietnam; Waste Cooking Oil","","","","","Aczél, János A., Procedures for synthesizing ratio judgements, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 27, 1, pp. 93-102, (1983); Super Decision Software Version 2 2 3 Software, (2012); Atadashi, I.

Because of international trade in secondhand CRT TVs and monitors and the toxic substances contained in them, the EOL fate of CRTs is an emerging concern in developing countries. In this study, the recycling and treatment techniques of EOL CRT TVs/monitors were investigated in three Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam). The current recycling methods of CRT TVs/monitors in Japan and China were also reviewed for comparison. The process flows and destinations of materials or parts at both formal and informal recycling sites were compared. Among the three countries, only one formal facility in the Philippines has automated processing equipment for CRTs. CRT glass handled by informal sectors was illegally dumped or disposed of with regular municipal solid waste. Some waste CRT glass was also informally recycled as glass materials or exported to China.

We are moving forward to “Smart City” project in Japan that brings a better life for citizens through public services, utilization of resources and less impact onenvironment. However, this project requires huge investment of financial amounts and long term to profitability under uncertainties. Therefore, real options analysis is used as a theoretical framework to better account for the technological and market uncertainties and irreversibility that impact the investment and innovation decisions of firms. This paper shows how to use the quadranomial approach for two sources of uncertainty and with compound rainbow options. The specific one is if the investors decide to invest in R&D of the project, they will get the different carbon credit values created from this project changing at the same volatility of project’s products in each investing node through Clean Development Mechanism.

The paper also examines how import protection has affected these productivity spillovers and how spillovers from wholly foreign MNEs and joint ventures differ. The most consistent result suggests wholly foreign MNEs impart negative spillovers while joint ventures tend to generate positive spillovers. Theory and random effects estimates also indicate that import protection reduces local firm productivity and weakens the effect of spillovers from all MNEs; but this result is not obtained when a fixed effects estimator is used. Results are similar in samples of labour-intensive industries, which include close to three fourths of all sample firms, but differ markedly for more capital-intensive groups. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Aitken, Brian J., Do domestic firms benefit from direct foreign investment?

QM is divided into two dimensions: hard QM and soft QM. Quality performance as an intended consequence of QM implementation is also examined as a potential mediator between QM and innovation. A conceptual framework is developed to postulate causal linkages between soft/hard QM, quality performance, and innovation performance. Data collected from 283 plants in eight countries and a technique of structural equation modeling are used to test this framework. The results indicate different paths to innovation from different dimensions of QM. Hard QM affects innovation performance directly and indirectly through its effect on quality performance. Soft QM has indirect effect on innovation performance through its effect on hard QM. This means that quality performance depends directly on hard QM which can be promoted by soft QM. Quality performance shows a partial mediating effect on the relationship between hard QM and innovation performance. Quality and innovation are not a matter of trade-off, but they can coexist in a cumulative improvement model with quality as a foundation. Firms have no need to abandon QM endeavor to achieve innovation. Instead, they should devote continuous efforts to maintain a solid quality system in place integrating a set of QM practices and corresponding performance measures. Managers are advised to emphasize on quality control tools and techniques and use teamwork, training, employee empowerment and problem-solving approaches as an underlying support. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hard Qm; Innovation; Quality Performance; Soft Qm; Economic And Social Effects; Human Resource Management; Personnel Training; Quality Management; Conceptual Frameworks; Hard Qm; Innovation Performance; Multi-dimensional View; Quality Control Tool; Quality Performance; Soft Qm; Structural Equation Modeling; Employee Empowerment; Innovation","Economic and social effects; Human resource management; Personnel training; Quality management; Conceptual frameworks; Hard QM; Innovation performance; Multi-dimensional view; Quality control tool; Quality performance; Soft QM; Structural equation modeling; Employee empowerment; Innovation","","","The authors appreciate the financial support for this research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science by Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research, Nos. 22330112 and 25245050 .","Abrunhosa, Ana, Are TQM principles supporting innovation in the Portuguese footwear industry?, Technovation, 28, 4, pp. 208-221, (2008); Abraham, Morris, Key factors predicting effectiveness of cultural change and improved productivity in implementing total quality management, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 16, 2, pp. 112-132, (1999); Ahire, Sanjay L., Impact of design management and process management on quality: An empirical investigation, Journal of Operations Management, 18, 5, pp. 549-575, (2000); Ahire, Sanjay L., An innovation diffusion model of TQM implementation, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 48, 4, pp. 445-464, (2001); Ahire, Sanjay L., Quality management in TQM versus non-TQM firms: An empirical investigation, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 13, 8, pp. 8-27, (1996); Ahire, Sanjay L., Development and validation of TQM implementation constructs, Decision Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 23-56, (1996); Anderson, John C., A Path Analytic Model of a Theory of Quality Management Underlying the Deming Management Method: Preliminary Empirical Findings, Decision Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 637-658, (1995); Anderson, Mary, A study of the relationship between quality management practices and performance in small businesses, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 16, 9, pp. 859-877, (1999); Arauz, Rita, Measuring changes in quality management: An empirical analysis of Japanese manufacturing companies, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 20, 12, pp. 1337-1374, (2009); Bennett, Roger C., The misuse of marketing: An American tragedy, Business Horizons, 24, 6, pp. 51-61, (1981)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09255273","","IJPCE","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926244695"

This study explores the ordering effects in a DCE surveying preferences for improvements in cyclone warning services in Vietnam. Respondents' choices are analysed non-parametrically and parametrically to investigate the ordering effects in their preferences. Across the sequence of six choice questions, the stated demand of respondents is statistically significantly different at the first position from all other positions. Based on a parametric analysis using mixed logit models, we also find that the willingness-to-pay for a number of improvement programs estimated at the first position is relatively larger when compared with the other positions. The findings indicate that although DCEs can provide additional information on respondents' preferences when compared with survey methods using a single valuation question, the trade-off for more information is the ordering effects over a sequence of repeated questions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Country; Discrete Choice Experiment; Ordering Effect; Stated Preference; Vietnam","","","","This study is a part of a research project “Estimating the benefits of an improved tropical cyclone warning service in Vietnam: An application of choice modelling” carried out with the aid of a grant from the Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia (EEPSEA).

Based on a review of relevant published ANA studies, we find that the extent of ANA reported by respondents in our Vietnam case study could be potentially more serious than in developed country studies. Our econometric analysis, based on a mixed logit model, shows that respondents who ignored the attributes have different preferences from respondents who attended to the attributes. An examination of ANA determinants using a multivariate probit model was undertaken to gain a better understanding of reasons for the differences in the preferences of two groups of respondents. Our results confirm that the stated ANA could be an example of a simplifying strategy of respondents, and that respondents ignored attributes which were not relevant to their situation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attribute Non-attendance; Developing Countries; Discrete Choice Experiments; Vietnam; Willingness-to-pay","","","","This is a part of a research project “Estimating the benefits of an improved tropical cyclone warning service in Vietnam: An application of choice modelling” carried out with the aid of a grant from the Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia (EEPSEA) (Grant No 106612-99906060-008 ).

An adversary can collect these freely available messages and specifically analyze them for privacy leaks, such as the users’ location. Unlike other approaches that try to detect these leaks using complete message streams, we put forward a rule-based approach that works on single and very short messages to detect location leaks. We evaluated our approach based on 2817 tweets from the Tweets2011 data set. It scores significantly better (accuracy = 84.95%) on detecting whenever a message reveals the user’s location than a baseline using machine learning and three extensions using heuristic. Advantages of our approach are not only to apply for online social network messages but also to extend for other areas (such as email, military, health) and for other languages. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Location Leak; Online Social Network; Short Text Message; Artificial Intelligence; Information Systems; Learning Systems; Location; Online Systems; Websites; Data Set; Message Streams; On-line Social Networks; Rule-based Approach; Sensitive Informations; Short Message; Short Text Messages; Social Networking (online)","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Learning systems; Location; Online systems; Websites; Data set; Message streams; On-line social networks; Rule-based approach; Sensitive informations; Short message; Short text messages; Social networking (online)","","","","Finkel, Jenny Rose, Incorporating non-local information into information extraction systems by Gibbs sampling, pp. 363-370, (2005); Ritter, Alan L., Named entity recognition in tweets: An experimental study, pp. 1524-1534, (2011); Proceeddings of the 20th Text Retrieval Conference Trec 2011, (2011); Cheng, Zhiyuan, You are where you tweet: A content-based approach to geo-locating Twitter users, International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings, pp. 759-768, (2010); Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality, (2012); Amitay, Einat, Web-a-where: Geotagging Web content, pp. 273-280, (2004); Fink, Clay R., Geolocating blogs from their textual content, SS-09-08, pp. 25-26, (2009); Kitamoto, Asanobu, Toponym-based geotagging for observing precipitation from social and scientific data streams, pp. 23-26, (2012); Language Detection Library for Java, (2010); Han, Bo, Automatically constructing a normalisation dictionary for microblogs, pp. 421-432, (2012)","Abramowicz, W.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","Institute for Applied Informatics (InfAI); OpenLink Software for supporting the workshop","International Workshops on Business Information Systems Workshops, BIS 2015","","Poznan","158479","18651348; 18651356","9783032045119; 9783642357015; 9783030057664; 9783031602597; 9783662471562; 9783319741604; 9783031616563; 9783031161674; 3642018556; 9783642280818","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952653231"

Searching literature reviews on economic-valuation techniques, the contingent valuation (CV) method has been popularly applied to estimate the economic value of biodiversity. This approach is based on a hypothetical scenario in which respondents are requested through questionnaires to reveal their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for biodiversity conservation. The article used CV to study the Mekong Delta urban households’ preferences and their willingness to pay for the program of biodiversity conservation in U Minh Thuong National Park, one of the largest peat swamp forests in Vietnam. Logistic regression was used to predict the probability of respondents willing to pay for the conservation program. The mean WTP was calculated approximately VND16,510 ($0.78) per household per month for all respondents and about VND31,520 ($1.49) after excluding the protest zero and scenario rejecting respondents. Aggregately, Mekong Delta urban residents agreed to contribute about $10.97 million annually for the project of biodiversity conservation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contingent Valuation; Genetic Resources; Wetland Conservation; Wtp","","","","","Bateman, Ian J., Elicitation and truncation effects in contingent valuation studies, Ecological Economics, 12, 2, pp. 161-179, (1995); Measuring the Economic Benefits of Provision of Nonmarket Goods Freshwater Wetlands in South Carolina, (1995); 2011 International Conference on Humanities Society and Culture Ipedr Singapore, (2011); Resource Assessment Commission S Kakadu Conservation Zone Contingent Valuation Study, (1991); Chen, Wendy Yan, Resident motivations and willingness-to-pay for urban biodiversity conservation in Guangzhou (China), Environmental Management, 45, 5, pp. 1052-1064, (2010); Christie, Michael, Valuing the diversity of biodiversity, Ecological Economics, 58, 2, pp. 304-317, (2006); Cummings, Ronald G., Unbiased value estimates for environmental goods: A cheap talk design for the contingent valuation method, American Economic Review, 89, 3, pp. 649-665, (1999); A Technical Report to Gtz Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve Project, (2009); Proceedings of the Gmsarn International Conference on Sustainable Development Challenges and Opportunities for Gms, (2007); Result of the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey 2006, (2025)","","SpringerOpen","","","","","","21937532","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007521450"

Data were collected from 1118 respondents in Japan, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The dependent variable was the intention to use one of three modes for work travel after getting a job: car, public transit, or other modes. The explanatory variables were three attitude factors taken from a previous study, including: 1/symbolic affective, reflecting affective motives of travel mode use; 2/instrumental, referring to functional attributes of travel modes; and 3/social orderliness which represents for environmental friendliness, safety, altruism, quietness et cetera. Several logit model estimates were made using the samples from the six countries separately and together. We obtained three main findings. First, attitude variables about the car were all significant determinants for the entire sample from Asian countries. Second, the social orderliness aspect of public transit was a common concern of respondents from developing countries in selecting this mode for work trips. Third, in countries in which the intent to use a car was not very high, attitude factors about the car were found to be significant determinants of the behavioral intention to commute by car but were less significant in countries in which the desire to use a car was high. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes Toward Travel Modes; Commuting Mode Choice; Mobility Management; Psychological Methods; Developing Countries; Logistic Regression; Commuting Modes; Environmental Friendliness; Explanatory Variables; Mobility Management; Psychological Factors; Psychological Methods; Public Transportation; Travel Modes; Urban Transportation; Altruism; Car Use; Commuting; Developing World; Logit Analysis; Psychology; Public Transport; Transportation Safety; Transportation System; Travel Behavior; China; Indonesia; Japan; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","Developing countries; Logistic regression; Commuting modes; Environmental friendliness; Explanatory variables; Mobility management; Psychological factors; Psychological methods; Public transportation; Travel modes; Urban transportation; altruism; car use; commuting; developing world; logit analysis; psychology; public transport; transportation safety; transportation system; travel behavior; China; Indonesia; Japan; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","","","The survey in this study was supported by the research group for the “Applicability of Ecological Transportation Systems in Developing Countries” of the International Association of Traffic and Safety Science.

While recent empirical studies make it clear that training intervention can improve the management level, it remains unclear why the managers had not made efforts to obtain these basic knowledge. To test the hypothesis that the reason lies in low valuation for obtaining knowledge, we conduct experimental training programs for the managers of SMEs in a knitwear cluster in rural town in Vietnam.

Or are individual-level analyses more appropriate for assessing the influence of values on ethical behaviors across country workforces? Using multi-level analyses for a 48-society sample, we test the utility of both the societal-level and individual-level dimensions of collectivism and individualism values for predicting ethical behaviors of business professionals. Our values-based behavioral analysis indicates that values at the individual-level make a more significant contribution to explaining variance in ethical behaviors than do values at the societal-level.

This study introduces a modified uncertainty analysis procedure and its importance in MFA. We generated a probability distribution using a Monte Carlo simulation, calculated the nitrogen budget for each process and then evaluated the plausibility under three different criterion sets. The third criterion, with one standard deviation of the budget value as the confidence interval and 68% as the confidence level, could be applied to effectively identify hidden uncertainties in the MFA system. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for revising parameters, followed by the reassessment of the model structure by revising equations or flow regime, if necessary. The number of processes that passed the plausibility test increased from five to nine after reassessment of model uncertainty with a greater model quality. The application of the uncertainty analysis approach to this case study revealed that the reassessment of equations in the aquaculture process largely changed the results for nitrogen flows to environments. The significant differences were identified as increased nitrogen load to the atmosphere and to soil/groundwater (17% and 41%, respectively), and a 58% decrease in nitrogen load to surface water. Thus, modified uncertainty analysis was considered to be an important screening system for ensuring quality of MFA modeling. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Material Flow Analysis (mfa); Monte Carlo Simulation; Nutrient; Reassessment Procedure; Uncertainty; Nitrogen; Budget Control; Monte Carlo Methods; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Probability Distributions; Watersheds; Confidence Interval; Confidence Levels; Material Flow Analysis; Model Uncertainties; Reassessment Procedure; Screening System; Standard Deviation; Uncertainty; Uncertainty Analysis; Ground Water; Nitrogen; Surface Water; Computer Simulation; Human Activity; Material Flow Analysis; Monte Carlo Analysis; Nutrient Dynamics; River Flow; Sensitivity Analysis; Uncertainty Analysis; Water Quality; Aquaculture; Article; Atmosphere; Case Study; Confidence Interval; Drainage Process; Flow Measurement; Industry; Market; Monte Carlo Method; Nitrogen Balance; Nitrogen Cycle; Nutrient Loading; River Basin; Soil; Solid Waste Collection Process; Statistical Concepts; Uncertainty Analysis Modification; Viet Nam; Waste Management; Day River; Nhue River","Budget control; Monte Carlo methods; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Probability distributions; Watersheds; Confidence interval; Confidence levels; Material flow analysis; Model uncertainties; Reassessment procedure; Screening system; Standard deviation; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; ground water; nitrogen; surface water; computer simulation; human activity; material flow analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; nutrient dynamics; river flow; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; water quality; aquaculture; article; atmosphere; case study; confidence interval; drainage process; flow measurement; industry; market; Monte Carlo method; nitrogen balance; nitrogen cycle; nutrient loading; river basin; soil; solid waste collection process; statistical concepts; uncertainty analysis modification; Viet Nam; waste management; Day River; Nhue River","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9","We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Ishidaira Hiroshi for helpful advice about uncertainty analysis.

AR showed advanced growth inhibition effects compared to antibiotics (amikacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and levofloxacin) frequently used for the treatment of infectious diseases, and worked synergistically with these antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of AR ranged from 13 to 20 mM. The bactericidal activity of AR was dose and time dependent. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was lower for Gram-negative bacteria (32 to 40 mM).

The results indicate a dominant role of the internal QM in SCQM which has a positive impact on the other SCQM dimensions and two types of quality performance.

It deals with four types of communication on the shop floor (small group problem solving, feedback, instructive communication, supervisory interaction facilitation) and three process management practices (process control, preventive maintenance, housekeeping). Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression techniques were used to test the hypothesized relationships. Data were collected from 238 manufacturing plants through a questionnaire survey conducted in eight countries to develop reliable and valid measurement scales for operations management. Findings: The statistical results demonstrate the positive effect of shop-floor communication on the implementation of process management practices and the resultant quality performance. The results also suggest that each type of shop-floor communication differently affects the way in which process management practices are implemented to influence quality performance. Originality/value: Although the existing literature of quality management highlights the importance of communication and information management for the successful implementation of quality management, little detailed study has been conducted on how specific types of communication support quality management practices to obtain quality performance. This study contributes to the literature by breaking down communication into four types and providing specific empirical evidence on the relationship between each type of communication, process management practices, and quality performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Communication; Empirical Study; Process Management; Quality Management; Quality Performance; Shop Floor","","","","","Abraham, Morris, Key factors predicting effectiveness of cultural change and improved productivity in implementing total quality management, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 16, 2, pp. 112-132, (1999); Abrunhosa, Ana, Are TQM principles supporting innovation in the Portuguese footwear industry?, Technovation, 28, 4, pp. 208-221, (2008); Ahire, Sanjay L., Impact of design management and process management on quality: An empirical investigation, Journal of Operations Management, 18, 5, pp. 549-575, (2000); Ahire, Sanjay L., Development and validation of TQM implementation constructs, Decision Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 23-56, (1996); Academy of Management Review, (1994); Arauz, Rita, Measuring changes in quality management: An empirical analysis of Japanese manufacturing companies, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 20, 12, pp. 1337-1374, (2009); Bayo-Moriones, Alberto, The impact of ISO 9000 and EFQM on the use of flexible work practices, International Journal of Production Economics, 130, 1, pp. 33-42, (2011); Beer, Michael, Why Total Quality Management Programs Do Not Persist: The Role of Management Quality and Implications for Leading a TQM Transformation, Decision Sciences, 34, 4, pp. 623-642, (2003); Black, Simon A., Identification of the critical factors of TQM, Decision Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 1-21, (1996); Chang, Hsinhsin, An empirical evaluation of performance measurement systems for total quality management, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 17, 8, pp. 1093-1109, (2006)","","","","","","","","20408269","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878254166"

However, modelling studies consistently have projected that climate change is likely to increase the intensity of cyclones and the related rainfall rates in the future. A precautionary approach to this possibility is to adapt to the adverse effects of the changing climate by improving early warning services for cyclones as a 'no or low-regrets' option. Given limited funding resources, assessments of economic efficiency will be necessary, and values for benefits are an essential input. This paper aims to estimate the benefits to households of an improved cyclone warning service in Vietnam. Choice experiment surveys with 1014 respondents were designed and conducted to inform this paper. The benefit estimates of the maximal improvements in a number of attributes of cyclone warning services (i.e. forecasting accuracy, frequency of update, and mobile phone based warnings) are approximately USD7.1-8.1 per household, which would be an upper bound estimate. Results from the marginal willingness to pay for the attributes suggest that investments should be dedicated to improvements in the accuracy of warning information and a warning service based on mobile phone short message. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation To Climate Change; Choice Experiments; Developing Countries; Tropical Cyclone Warning Services; Vietnam; Willingness To Pay; Accuracy Assessment; Anthropogenic Effect; Climate Change; Developing World; Economic Activity; Estimation Method; Experimental Study; Precautionary Principle; Rainfall; Tropical Cyclone; Warning System; Willingness To Pay; Viet Nam","accuracy assessment; anthropogenic effect; climate change; developing world; economic activity; estimation method; experimental study; precautionary principle; rainfall; tropical cyclone; warning system; willingness to pay; Viet Nam","","","This is a part of the research project “Estimating the benefits of an improved tropical cyclone warning service in Vietnam: An application of choice modelling” carried out with the aid of grants from the Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia (EEPSEA) and the Special Coordination Funds for Promotion of Science and Technology “Global Environmental Leaders Education Program for Designing a Low-Carbon World” from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology, Japan.

The bacteria produce high molecular weight amylase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram activity staining showed a single band at around 150 kDa. The enzyme was purified by disc preparative native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ion chromatograph analysis of reaction products of P. ethanolidurans amylase on starch showed that glucose and maltose are the main final products. The appearance of maltose and glucose as major hydrolysis products suggests that the amylase produced by this organism is of α-type. Optimal temperature and pH for the enzyme activity were 60°C and pH 4.0 - 6.0, respectively. Enzyme activity was not affected by the presence of 10 mM calcium chloride (Ca2+) or the presence of 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl.

For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88% of the observed maneuvers - either staying in the current lane or turning left or right - could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.

In early 2008, the country faced a sudden reversal of capital flows as signs of developing domestic vulnerabilities became evident. The downward pressure on the dong then intensified with the onset of the global financial crisis in the fall. In these environments, the Vietnamese authorities responded with various exchange rate policy measures. The paper documents a shift in Vietnam's de facto exchange rate regime, from a basket peg to a simple US dollar peg, when the domestic vulnerabilities became compounded by the evolving global crisis. The authorities utilized additional measures to relieve pressure on the parallel exchange rate. An event study methodology finds little evidence of systematic effectiveness for these policy actions; any effectiveness was short-lived. A close examination of individual actions suggests that the impact of foreign exchange market intervention appeared more consistent than any other type of measure and most effective when combined with other measures. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rate Policy; Official Exchange Rate; Parallel Exchange Rate; The Global Financial Crisis; Vietnam","","","","","Caporale, Guglielmo Maria, Monetary policy and the exchange rate during the Asian crisis: Identification through heteroscedasticity, Journal of International Money and Finance, 24, 1, pp. 39-53, (2005); Evans, Martin D.D., Do currency markets absorb news quickly?, Journal of International Money and Finance, 24, 2, pp. 197-217, (2005); Fatum, Rasmus, Is sterilised foreign exchange intervention effective after all?

It was further adapted to suit the specific conditions in developing countries where the available data is scarce and uncertain. The 'adapted MFA' methodology optimises the number of parameters, describes these parameters as probability distributions and assesses the accuracy and uncertainty of the model values by Monte Carlo simulation. This study illustrates the first successful application of the 'adapted MFA' methodology in a small and low-income area including two neighbouring communes in rural northern Vietnam, where environmental sanitation and traditional agricultural practices are strongly interlinked and have an impact on the surrounding environment. Moreover, data on this area is typically scarce and uncertain. The obtained results reveal that the agricultural system was a significant source of nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P)), which affect the surrounding environment mainly due to the overuse of chemical fertilizers. Every year, there were 103 ± 39 tonnes of N released into the atmosphere, 25 ± 3 tonnes of N leached to the surface water and 14 ± 2 tonnes of P accumulated in the soil, all originating from the applied chemical fertilizers. In addition, the sanitation system was also a critical source of nutrients that enter the surface water. 69 ± 6 tonnes of N and 23 ± 4 tonnes of P came from households through effluents of on-site sanitation systems (such as latrines and septic tanks) and were directly discharged to surface water every year. Moreover, the whole system annually generated a large nutrient source (214 ± 56 tonnes of N; 58 ± 16 tonnes of P) in the form of wastewater, faecal sludge, animal manure and organic solid wastes. The validated MFA was used to model different scenarios for the study site. The first scenario demonstrated that if nutrient management is not improved, wastewater as well as faecal sludge and organic solid waste are expected to double in the year 2020 as compared to that in 2008. The second and third scenario revealed possible strategies to significantly reduce environmental pollution and reuse nutrient sources predicted to be available in the year 2020. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of variance and regression techniques were applied to the database of the high-performance manufacturing (HPM) project to analyze the differences and similarities existing across the countries on the degree of implementation of QMI practices and their contribution to operational performance of manufacturing plants. Findings: The results of statistical analysis indicate significant differences in the implementation of QMI practices across the countries. This study highlights the important role of QMI in Japanese plants where shop-floor and cross-functional communication and information sharing practices significantly impact on different dimensions of operational performance. Practical implications: This study suggests that HPM could be achieved by the implementation of a set of communication and information sharing practices in shop-floor and cross-functional levels of manufacturing plants. Originality/value: Although scholars considered information as one dimension of quality management, existing quality management literature provides little empirical evidence on the relationship of QMI and operational performance of manufacturing plants. This paper fills the gap by introducing a comprehensive research framework to analyze the communication and information sharing practices in the shop-floor and cross-functional levels. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Management Information Systems; Operations And Production Management; Quality Management","","","","","Ahmad, Sohel, The role of infrastructure practices in the effectiveness of JIT practices: Implications for plant competitiveness, Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M, 20, 3, pp. 161-191, (2003); Carr, Amelia S., Communication methods, information sharing, supplier development and performance: An empirical study of their relationships, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 27, 4, pp. 346-370, (2007); Econometrica, (1960); Interfaces, (1992); Flynn, Barbara B., Information-processing alternatives for coping with manufacturing environment complexity, Decision Sciences, 30, 4, pp. 1021-1052, (1999); Flynn, Barbara B., Relevance of Baldrige constructs in an international context: A study of national culture, Journal of Operations Management, 24, 5, pp. 583-603, (2006); Flynn, Barbara B., A framework for quality management research and an associated measurement instrument, Journal of Operations Management, 11, 4, pp. 339-366, (1994); Flynn, Barbara B., The Impact of Quality Management Practices on Performance and Competitive Advantage, Decision Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 659-691, (1995); Annual Review of Sociology, (1979); Forza, Cipriano, The impact of information systems on quality performance: An empirical study, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 15, 6, pp. 69-83, (1995)","","","","","","","","20408269","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955692274"

In spite of its importance to tourism, no systematic analysis has been undertaken thus far to understand the perceptions of its residents toward tourism in their area. Guided by the Social Exchange Theory, this study investigated Cuc Phuong National Park (CPNP) residents' perceptions of tourism impacts and their support for tourism development in their areas. Additionally, the study also explored how demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, place of birth, marital status and level of education, household monthly income, job status and length of residency) explain residents' perceptions and their support. It was found that residents in general have positive perceptions towards the impacts brought by tourism in CPNP especially with regards to its social-cultural and environmental impacts and they strongly supported tourism development. However, these perceptions differ according to residents' socio-demographic characteristics. The study also revealed that residents' age and gender and their perceptions of tourism impacts could be predictors for their support for tourism development in CPNP. Based on these findings, the concluding part discusses the study's implications and provides suggestions for the future. © 2011 International University College.

Changes in SDO composition during storage took place more rapidly than in cold-pressed oil.

A cyclic material flow with alternative usage of all materials in the loop is an essential feature of an eco-industrial network. While eco-industrial networking has been primarily applied on the high-tech sector, this paper attempts to apply the principles on the fishery sector of An Giang, a Vietnamese province in the Mekong River Delta. An Giang Province has its own market share in the trade of Tra and Basa fish. The industries in the value chain of Tra and Basa are in a situation that forces them to improve their competitiveness to retain the market share. It was found that forming an eco-industrial network and recruiting new businesses to utilize all materials in the process provides additional revenue apart from reducing waste disposal concerns. This paper details the current market situation, the issues faced and material flow patterns and presents a feasible eco-industrial network. The results of the study indicate that the eco-industrial network creates positive impacts in terms of increased competitiveness, improved socio-economic conditions and cleaner environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As for the transmission mechanism, the credit and exchange rate channels are more important than the interest rate channel. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Monetary Policy; Transmission Mechanism; Vector Autoregression; Vietnam","","","","","Esparza-Rodríguez, Saúl Alfonso, The federal funds rate and the channels of monetary transmission, American Economic Review, 82, 4, pp. 901-921, (1992); Journal of Economic Perspectives, (1995); Disyatat, Piti, Monetary policy and the transmission mechanism in Thailand, Journal of Asian Economics, 14, 3, pp. 389-418, (2003); Applied Econometrics and International Development, (2007); Applied Econometrics and International Development, (2004); A Var Analysis of Singapore S Monetary Transmission Mech Anism, (2004); undefined, (2009); Economics of Money Banking and Financial Markets, (1998); Morsink, James, A peek inside the black box: The monetary transmission mechanism in Japan, IMF Staff Papers, 48, 1, pp. 22-57, (2001); undefined, (2009)","","","","","","","","15784487","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-68249140237"

On the corporate side, there is also much reliance on tacit knowledge.

It argues that local suppliers' responsiveness can be a supplementary condition to absorptive capacity when considering buyer-supplier relation of knowledge transfer. In Vietnam where local suppliers were less capable or limited, Honda has exploited the supplier responsiveness to develop external manufacturing capabilities which contributed to Honda Vietnam's performance. Responsiveness enabled Honda to use a hands-on approach as an effective mechanism to transfer key principles and tacit technical knowledge to local suppliers in the initial stages of establishing a relationship. As a result, Honda is both beneficial from suppliers' specific absorptive capacity and continuous responsiveness. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The present study indicates that the Green Revolution began in irrigated favorable areas and spread to the less favorable areas in Vietnam such as in other Asian countries. What is unique in Vietnam is that although the Green Revolution ended in the mid-1980s in the Philippines and Indonesia, it has still been sustained as of 2003. Our analyses revealed that such growth had been supported by continuous improvements of modern varieties by regional research institutes. The varieties imported from China have contributed to the Green Revolution in northern Vietnam and those developed by the International Rice Research Institute in southern Vietnam.
