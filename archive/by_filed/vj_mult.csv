This retrospective observational study evaluated the predictive accuracy of the SOFA score, APACHE II score, SpO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> ratio, and PaO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> ratio for mortality in ARDS patients in Vietnam. The study included 335 adult ARDS patients admitted to a central hospital from August 2015 to August 2023. Among them, 66.9% were male, the median age was 55 years, and 61.5% died in the hospital. The SOFA (AUROC: 0.651) and APACHE II scores (AUROC: 0.693) showed poor discriminatory ability for hospital mortality. The SpO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> (AUROC: 0.595) and PaO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> ratios (AUROC: 0.595) also displayed poor discriminatory ability. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for the same set of confounding variables, the APACHE II score (adjusted OR: 1.152), SpO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> ratio (adjusted OR: 0.985), and PaO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> ratio (adjusted OR: 0.989) were independently associated with hospital mortality. Although the SOFA score (adjusted OR: 1.132) indicated a potential association with hospital mortality, it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.081). However, a SOFA score of ≥ 10 emerged as an independent predictor (adjusted OR: 3.398) of hospital mortality. These findings emphasize the need for further studies to develop more accurate scoring systems for predicting outcomes in ARDS patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ards); Apache Ii Score; Berlin Definition Criteria; Critical Care; Mechanical Ventilation; Mortality; New Global Definition; Pao2/fio2 Ratio; Sofa Score; Spo2/fio2 Ratio; Adult; Aged; Apache; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Female; Hospital Mortality; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Organ Dysfunction Score; Prognosis; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Retrospective Study; Viet Nam; Adult; Aged; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Dysfunction Scores; Prognosis; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Retrospective Studies; Vietnam","adult; aged; APACHE; diagnosis; epidemiology; female; hospital mortality; human; male; middle aged; mortality; organ dysfunction score; prognosis; respiratory distress syndrome; retrospective study; Viet Nam; Adult; Aged; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Dysfunction Scores; Prognosis; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Retrospective Studies; Vietnam","","","We are expressing our deepest gratitude for the invaluable assistance and support from the staff of the Center for Emergency Medicine and the Center for Critical Care Medicine at the Bach Mai Hospital throughout the completion of this study.

This study examines the relationship between protein intake from whole foods and SC in a Vietnamese population. A case-control study was designed in the university hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam, from 2003 to 2019. Participants included 1182 SC cases and 2995 controls. Of the participants, 2,580 were men, and 1,597 were women. Protein intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (OR, 95%CI) examined the risk of SC associated with total protein and subgroups of mammal-animals and fish-poultry protein. Overall protein intake was negatively associated with SC (fifth vs. first quintile: OR (95%CI): 0.41 (0.32, 0.51). The dose-response relationship was also observed per increment quintile, OR (95%CI): 0.81 (0.77, 0.86) for both genders, OR (95%CI): 0.82 (0.77, 0.88) in men, OR (95%CI): 0.80 (0.73, 0.87) in women, OR (95%CI): 0.82 (0.77, 0.86) for noncardiac and OR (95%CI): 0.79 (0.63, 1.00) for cardiac stomach cancer. The beneficial effects of SC remained for the protein sources from mammal-animals and fish-poultry protein. The significant inverse association between protein intake remained in the ever and never tobacco smoking, no-alcohol use and alcohol use, blood group A and AB, and O, H. Pylori infected group, and the status of body-mass-index. The findings suggest that a high-protein diet is associated with lower SC risk. Further investigation is warranted to understand the beneficial effect of protein intake against stomach cancer. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dietary Proteins; Adult; Aged; Case Control Study; Diet; Epidemiology; Etiology; Female; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevention And Control; Protein Intake; Risk Factor; Stomach Tumor; Viet Nam; Adult; Aged; Case-control Studies; Diet; Dietary Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors; Stomach Neoplasms; Vietnam","adult; aged; case control study; diet; epidemiology; etiology; female; human; male; middle aged; odds ratio; prevention and control; protein intake; risk factor; stomach tumor; Viet Nam; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Diet; Dietary Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors; Stomach Neoplasms; Vietnam","","Dietary Proteins","Funding text 1: The Grant Agreement No.: 18/FIRST/1a/HMU, Under the Project: \u201CFostering Innovation through Research, Science, and Technology,\u201D during 2017\u20132019; Viet Nam Ministry of Science and Technology, during 2006\u20132011.; Funding text 2: We sincerely appreciate the valuable support of Bach Mai, National Cancer Hospitals, and Hanoi Medical University Hospital staff in conducting the study.

We examined the associations between dietary calcium intake and the risk of overall and specific causes of mortality. A prospective cohort study was performed for 42,146 individuals from 2008 to 2019. Face-to-face interviews used structured semi-quantitative food frequency and demographic lifestyle questionnaires to obtain calcium intake. The cause of 2,494 deaths was determined from medical records. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a Cox proportional hazards model across eight quantiles of dietary calcium intake. Compared to the reference range 222.5-261.3 mg/day, the lowest dietary calcium intake was associated with an increased mortality risk from all causes, HR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.04, 1.42). In contrast, the highest dietary calcium intake was associated with an increased risk of cancer death, HR (95% CI): 1.43 (1.01, 2.01). By stratified analysis, the lowest dietary calcium intake was associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes in women, in never smokers, individuals with a BMI < 23 kg/m², never drinkers, no diabetes, no history of hypertension, and no history of cancer. An increased risk of overall mortality and cancer death at the borderline was observed for the lowest and highest calcium intake, respectively. There is a possible U-shaped association between calcium intake and the risk of all causes and cancer. The reference group ranges from 222.5 mg/day to 261.3 mg/day. The findings warrant further research on the association between dietary calcium intake and overall mortality and cancer. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calcium; Cohort Study; Dietary; Overall And Specific Causes Of Mortality; Risk Factors; Vietnam; Calcium, Dietary; Adult; Adverse Event; Aged; Calcium Intake; Cause Of Death; Female; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Neoplasm; Proportional Hazards Model; Prospective Study; Questionnaire; Risk Factor; Adult; Aged; Calcium, Dietary; Cause Of Death; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surveys And Questionnaires","adult; adverse event; aged; calcium intake; cause of death; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; proportional hazards model; prospective study; questionnaire; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Calcium, Dietary; Cause of Death; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Calcium, Dietary","The Grant Agreement No.: 18/FIRST/1a/HMU, Under the Project: \u201CFostering Innovation through Research, Science, and Technology,\u201D during 2017\u20132019; Viet Nam Ministry of Science and Technology, during 2006\u20132011.","Diet and Health Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk, (1989); Office of Dietary Supplements NIH, (2024); Khan, Belal, Higher dietary calcium intakes are associated with reduced risks of fractures, cardiovascular events, and mortality: A prospective cohort study of older men and women, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 30, 10, pp. 1758-1766, (2015); Lee, Jaekyung, Association between Daily Dietary Calcium Intake and the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Postmenopausal Korean Women, Nutrients, 16, 7, (2024); Pana, Tiberiu Alexandru, Calcium intake, calcium supplementation and cardiovascular disease and mortality in the British population: EPIC-norfolk prospective cohort study and meta-analysis, European Journal of Epidemiology, 36, 7, pp. 669-683, (2021); Yang, Baiyu, Calcium intake and mortality from all causes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease: The Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 103, 3, pp. 886-894, (2016); Michaëlsson, Karl, Long term calcium intake and rates of all cause and cardiovascular mortality: Community based prospective longitudinal cohort study, BMJ, 346, 7895, (2013); Sun, Xiaomin, U-shaped association between dietary calcium density intake during adolescence and hypertension in adulthood: a 20-year longitudinal nationwide study in China, British Journal of Nutrition, 127, 11, pp. 1723-1730, (2022); Wang, Xia, Dietary calcium intake and mortality risk from cardiovascular disease and all causes: A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, BMC Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 1-10, (2014); Ngoan, Le Tran, Waterpipe Tobacco Smoking and Risk of Cancer Mortality, JAMA Oncology, 10, 9, pp. 1237-1244, (2024)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","40877269","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014756762"

Through whole exome sequencing, we analysed the association between gene-based burden of rare, protein-altering genetic variants and disease risk in 4,667 affected individuals and 5,473 unaffected controls. We tested genes surpassing exome-wide significance (P < 2.5 × 10-6) for replication in a further 2,519 cases and 472,189 controls. We observed carriers of rare, protein-altering variants at UBOX5 (observed in 154 out of 7,186 affected individuals [2.1%] and in 3,975 out of 477,197 unaffected controls [0.83%]) to be associated with 2.13-fold increased risk of PACG (95%ci, 1.69 – 2.69; P = 1.25 × 10-10). We performed substrate trapping assays coupled with mass spectrometry and observed Binding Immunoglobulin Protein (BIP) as a key substrate for UBOX5. Biological assays showed UBOX5 acts by ubiquitinating BIP. We evaluated the functional status of 35 UBOX5 variants and observed that functionally deficient variants were enriched in affected individuals compared to controls. We validated this finding in an independent collection where 3 persons carrying functionally deficient variants were observed out of 208 cases (1.4%), whereas none were observed in 600 controls. Our findings suggest the UBOX5—BIP signalling pathway might be involved in biology of primary angle-closure glaucoma. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calnexin; Ubiquitin Protein Ligase; Calnexin; Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone Bip; Genomic Dna; Histone H2b; Proteasome Inhibitor; Ubiquitin Protein Ligase; Biological Development; Biological Processes; Blindness; Cancer; Substrate; Article; Cellular Distribution; Closed Angle Glaucoma; Controlled Study; Cytoplasm; Exome; Functional Status; Gene; Genetic Variation; Hek293 Cell Line; Human; Human Cell; Immunoblotting; Immunofluorescence; Immunoprecipitation; Italy; Lens Epithelium; Major Clinical Study; Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Weight; Nih 3t3 Cell Line; Pakistan; Photoreceptor; Protein Expression; Retina Ganglion Cell; Signal Transduction; Sphincter Pupillae Muscle; Ubiquitination; Ubox5 Gene; Unfolded Protein Response; Whole Exome Sequencing; Aged; Case Control Study; Female; Genetic Predisposition; Genetics; Male; Metabolism; Middle Aged; Aged; Case-control Studies; Exome Sequencing; Female; Genetic Predisposition To Disease; Glaucoma, Angle-closure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ubiquitination","calnexin; endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP; genomic DNA; histone H2B; proteasome inhibitor; ubiquitin protein ligase; biological development; biological processes; blindness; cancer; substrate; Article; cellular distribution; closed angle glaucoma; controlled study; cytoplasm; exome; functional status; gene; genetic variation; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence; immunoprecipitation; Italy; lens epithelium; major clinical study; mass spectrometry; molecular weight; NIH 3T3 cell line; Pakistan; photoreceptor; protein expression; retina ganglion cell; signal transduction; sphincter pupillae muscle; ubiquitination; UBOX5 gene; unfolded protein response; whole exome sequencing; aged; case control study; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; male; metabolism; middle aged; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Exome Sequencing; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ubiquitination","","calnexin, 139873-08-8; ubiquitin protein ligase, 134549-57-8","Supported by the Biomedical Research Council, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore (to Z.Li., C.C.K); by the Singapore Ministry of Health\u2019s National Medical Research Council under its STaR Investigator Award (MOH-STaR19nov-0001; to T.A.) and the National Research Foundation Singapore under its Open Fund - Large Collaborative Grant (MOH-OFLCG21jun-0003; to T.A., Z.W., and C.C.K.), administered by the Singapore Ministry of Health\u2019s National Medical Research Council; by Universiti Sains Malaysia Research University Individual grant 1001/PPSP/812152 (to A.T.L-S); by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology (to A.P.K), by the General Research Fund, Hong Kong (14102122 & 14105320 to C.C.T).

To address these problems, this study introduces an efficient one-stage object detector that is designed mainly for detecting objects on remote sensing images, which consists of several innovations. Firstly, an extraction block is proposed called PRepConvBlock that leverages reparameterization convolution and partial feature utilization to effectively reduce the complexity in convolution operations, allowing for the utilization of larger kernel sizes in order to form the longer interactions between features and significantly expand receptive fields. Secondly, a unique shallow multi-scale fusion framework called SB-FPN based on Bi-FPN that utilizes the cross-interaction between shallow scale and deeper scale while inheriting the bidirectional connection from Bi-FPN to enhance the visual representation of features. Lastly, a Shallow-level Optimized Reparameterization Architecture Detector (SORA-DET) is proposed by applying several introduced innovations. This object detector is designed for UAV remote sensing object detection tasks that employ up to four detection heads. As a result, our proposed detector obtains a competitive performance that outperforms most of the other large-size models and SOTA works. In detail, the SORA-DET achieves 39.3% mAP50 in the VisDrone2019 test set while reaching up to 84.0% mAP50 in the SeaDroneSeeV2 validation set. Furthermore, our proposed detector is smaller than nearly 88.1% in parameters and has an inference speed of only 5.4 ms compared to other large-scale one-stage detectors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Human; Remote Sensing; Velocity","article; controlled study; deep learning; human; remote sensing; velocity","","","This work is supported by Osaka Metropolitan University and Ho Chi Minh City Open University.","Zhu, Xingkui, TPH-YOLOv5: Improved YOLOv5 Based on Transformer Prediction Head for Object Detection on Drone-captured Scenarios, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021-October, pp. 2778-2788, (2021); Yolov5 A State of the Art Real Time Object Detection System, (2021); Zhao, Liangliang, MS-YOLOv7:YOLOv7 Based on Multi-Scale for Object Detection on UAV Aerial Photography, Drones, 7, 3, (2023); Liu, Ze, Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 9992-10002, (2021); Wang, Chien Yao, YOLOv7: Trainable Bag-of-Freebies Sets New State-of-the-Art for Real-Time Object Detectors, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023-June, pp. 7464-7475, (2023); Vaswani, Ashish, Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017-December, pp. 5999-6009, (2017); Hu, Mengzi, Efficient-Lightweight YOLO: Improving Small Object Detection in YOLO for Aerial Images, Sensors, 23, 14, (2023); Liu, Chen, A Lightweight Object Detector Based on Spatial-Coordinate Self-Attention for UAV Aerial Images, Remote Sensing, 15, 1, (2023); Alzubaidi, Laith, Review of deep learning: concepts, CNN architectures, challenges, applications, future directions, Journal of Big Data, 8, 1, (2021); Chen, Honghao, PeLK: Parameter-Efficient Large Kernel ConvNets with Peripheral Convolution, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5557-5567, (2024)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","40764799","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012732034"

Pooled oral fluids testing is a practical approach for pathogen monitoring, but compared to blood, the virus concentration is lower, increasing false negatives. We developed a highly sensitive method for ASFV detection in pig oral fluids using a pretreatment-based concentration protocol. We collected oral fluids from sub-clinical raised pigs in northern Vietnam and conducted a field evaluation using the developed method. A spike test showed up to 100-fold greater sensitivity than a reference method. For performance evaluation, 68 pooled oral fluid samples were collected, of which 63 originated from raised pigs in northern Vietnam and 5 were obtained from healthy pigs in Japan as negative controls. Using real-time PCR, 9/68 (13.2%) were positive by the reference method, while 23/68 (33.8%) were positive by the developed method. Real-time LAMP detected 1/68 (1.5%) and 6/68 (8.8%) respectively. The developed method therefore improved the diagnostic performance and enabled early diagnosis prior to disease onset. These results suggest enhanced sensitivity and feasibility for early ASF diagnosis, potentially contributing to more effective outbreak control. The developed method offers a simple and sensitive tool for rapid ASFV screening in both affected and at-risk farms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","African Swine Fever Virus; Early Diagnosis; Oral Fluid; Pig; Virion Concentration; African Swine Fever; African Swine Fever Virus; Animal; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Genetics; Isolation And Purification; Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification; Molecular Diagnosis; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pig; Procedures; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Saliva; Sensitivity And Specificity; Viet Nam; Virology; African Swine Fever; African Swine Fever Virus; Animals; Lamp Assay; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Saliva; Sensitivity And Specificity; Swine; Vietnam","African swine fever; African swine fever virus; animal; diagnosis; epidemiology; genetics; isolation and purification; loop mediated isothermal amplification; molecular diagnosis; nucleic acid amplification techniques; pig; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; saliva; sensitivity and specificity; Viet Nam; virology; African Swine Fever; African Swine Fever Virus; Animals; LAMP assay; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Saliva; Sensitivity and Specificity; Swine; Vietnam","","","This research was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [Numbers JP21H03180, JP22K05950, JP22KK0097, JP24H00122], Bilateral Program [Number JPJSBP120199944], and the Joint Usage/Research Center for Global Collaborative Research, Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.","2020 Bulletin Panorama Thematic Portfolio; Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, (2012); Beemer, Oriana, Assessing the value of PCR assays in oral fluid samples for detecting African swine fever, classical swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease in U.S. Swine, PLOS ONE, 14, 7, (2019); Yamazaki, Yasuko, Development of a simple and highly sensitive virion concentration method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, Heliyon, 10, 12, (2024); Dixon, Linda K., African Swine Fever Epidemiology and Control, Annual Review of Animal Biosciences, 8, pp. 221-246, (2020); Galindo, Inmaculada, African swine fever virus: A review, Viruses, 9, 5, (2017); Sànchez-Vizcaíno, José Manuel, An update on the epidemiology and pathology of African swine fever, Journal of Comparative Pathology, 152, 1, pp. 9-21, (2015); Rowlands, Rebecca J., African swine fever virus isolate, Georgia, 2007, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 14, 12, pp. 1870-1874, (2008); Sauter-Louis, Carola M., African swine fever in wild boar in europe—a review, Viruses, 13, 9, (2021); Blome, Sandra, African swine fever – A review of current knowledge, Virus Research, 287, (2020)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","40739285","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012240758"

Macrophages also play critical roles in OA progression. However, whether macrophage polarization is involved in OA-related fibrosis has not been adequately defined. Here, we investigated the effect of M2-like macrophages compared to M1-like macrophages on the myofibroblast differentiation of human synovial fibroblasts (HSFs). M1- and M2-like macrophages differentiated from the human monocytic THP-1 cells were co-cultured with HSFs for 72 h. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive cells and gene expression of pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic factors were quantified. The concentration of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) in the culture supernatant was also analyzed, and its effect on the regulation of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway was further investigated. We found that, cocultured with M2-like macrophages increased the number of α-SMA positive cells and expression of pro-fibrotic genes and decreased the expression of anti-fibrotic genes in HSFs. TGF‑β1 was highly secreted by M2‑like macrophages and accelerated the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 in HSF cells. Our results indicate the pro-fibrotic effects of M2-like macrophages in myofibroblast differentiation of HSFs, in association with the TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway activation.

Recently, SLs have been reported to positively regulate disease resistance in plants. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the synthetic SL analog rac-4-bromodebranon (rac-4BD) on systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in rice. First, we demonstrated in vitro that rac-4BD, similar to the common SL analog rac-GR24, promotes the interaction of SL and karrikin receptor, D14 and D14-like (D14L), respectively, with signaling factor D3. Gene expression analysis and inoculation tests indicated that pretreatment with rac-4BD promotes the effect of the SAR inducer BIT. Activation of SAR was also significantly observed in the SL and karrikin signal-deficient rice mutant d3. These results suggest that D3-mediated SL/karrikin signaling by rac-4BD treatment does not directly activate rice immunity but induces a priming state in the plant that enhances SAR induction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Oryza Sativa; Priming; Strigolactone; Systemic Acquired Resistance; Lactone; 3-methyl-2h-furo(2,3-c)pyran-2-one; Furans; Gr24 Strigolactone; Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-ring; Lactones; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Proteins; Pyrans; 3-methyl-2h-furo(2,3-c)pyran-2-one; Furan Derivative; Fused Heterocyclic Rings; Gr24 Strigolactone; Lactone; Phytohormone; Plant Protein; Pyran Derivative; Disease Resistance; Drug Effect; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Immunology; Metabolism; Microbiology; Oryza; Plant Disease; Signal Transduction; Disease Resistance; Furans; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-ring; Lactones; Plant Diseases; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Proteins; Pyrans; Signal Transduction","3-methyl-2H-furo(2,3-c)pyran-2-one; furan derivative; fused heterocyclic rings; GR24 strigolactone; lactone; phytohormone; plant protein; pyran derivative; disease resistance; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; Oryza; plant disease; signal transduction; Disease Resistance; Furans; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring; Lactones; Plant Diseases; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Proteins; Pyrans; Signal Transduction","","lactone, 1338-03-0; 3-methyl-2H-furo(2,3-c)pyran-2-one; Furans; GR24 strigolactone; Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring; Lactones; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Proteins; Pyrans","This work was partially supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries under Science and Technology Research Promotion Program for Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Food Industry (27004A) to K.Y., K.A., T.A. and H.

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age Structure; Demography; Disability; Disease Incidence; Global Perspective; Health Care; Index Method","age structure; demography; disability; disease incidence; global perspective; health care; index method","","","This research was funded by The Leona M. and Harry B.

Meanwhile, edible films and coatings might be an option, they are easily degradable, safe for consumption, and environmentally friendly. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of various CNC formulations as Pickering emulsions with pregelatinized cornstarch incorporating essential oil of cornmint on the characterization of edible coating solutions and film. The development of edible films was using pregelatinized cornstarch (PCS), including cornmint essential oil (CEO) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC). To examine the impact of the CNC content on the physicochemical, mechanical, and optical characteristics of these films, different concentrations (0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.25, 0.30, and 0.50% w/w) of CNC were added. The coating solution’s pH and viscosity, as well as the thickness and roughness of the film, usually rise with an increase in CNC concentration. Conversely, this led to a reduction in the weight loss during heating, elongation, and tensile strength, as well as Young’s modulus. The different amount of CNC (%) did not have a significant effect on the water solubility, hydrophobicity, color, water vapor permeability, or surface microstructure, as observed by atomic force microscopy. The addition of CNC to the film matrix reduced its mechanical strength but basically has low water vapor permeability and high surface hydrophobicity. Consequently, the films produced in this study can be effectively used as edible films in situations that demand strong resistance to water but do not require significant mechanical strength. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomaterial; Edible Coating; Nanocrystal; Pregelatinized Cornstarch; Starch; Biomaterial; Cellulose Nanocrystal; Essential Oil; Nanocrystal; Starch; Article; Atomic Force Microscopy; Body Weight Loss; Color; Controlled Study; Edible Packaging; Emulsion; Heating; Hydrophobicity; Nonhuman; Permeability; Ph; Pharmaceutics; Tensile Strength; Thickness; Viscosity; Water; Water Solubility; Water Vapor","biomaterial; cellulose nanocrystal; essential oil; nanocrystal; starch; article; atomic force microscopy; body weight loss; color; controlled study; edible packaging; emulsion; heating; hydrophobicity; nonhuman; permeability; pH; pharmaceutics; tensile strength; thickness; viscosity; water; water solubility; water vapor","","starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9","This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [Project no.

The extent to which traits of dominant and rare tree species differ remains untested across a broad environmental range, limiting our understanding of how species traits and the environment shape forest functional composition. We use a global dataset of tree composition of >22,000 forest plots and 11 traits of 1663 tree species to ask how locally dominant and rare species differ in their trait values, and how these differences are driven by climatic gradients in temperature and water availability in forest biomes across the globe. We find three consistent trait differences between locally dominant and rare species across all biomes; dominant species are taller, have softer wood and higher loading on the multivariate stem strategy axis (related to narrow tracheids and thick bark). The difference between traits of dominant and rare species is more strongly driven by temperature compared to water availability, as temperature might affect a larger number of traits. Therefore, climate change driven global temperature rise may have a strong effect on trait differences between dominant and rare tree species and may lead to changes in species abundances and therefore strong community reassembly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Water; Water; Abundance; Climate Effect; Dominance; Forest Ecosystem; Global Perspective; Rare Species; Temperature Effect; Tree; Water Availability; Angiosperm; Article; Biome; Climate; Climate Change; Forest; Gymnosperm; High Temperature; Population Abundance; Temperature; Classification; Ecosystem; Physiology; Species Difference; Wood; Water; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Species Specificity; Temperature; Trees; Water; Wood","abundance; climate effect; dominance; forest ecosystem; global perspective; rare species; temperature effect; tree; water availability; angiosperm; Article; biome; climate; climate change; forest; gymnosperm; high temperature; population abundance; temperature; classification; ecosystem; physiology; species difference; wood; water; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Species Specificity; Temperature; Trees; Water; Wood","","water, 7732-18-5; Water","This research has been funded by a grant from DOB Ecology.

But the effects of heat stress during grain filling on the subsequent development and adaptive traits remain to be elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effects of heat stress during parental grain filling on the thermotolerance of subsequent plants grown under heat stress after anthesis. Subsequent plants were grown from control (25 °C) and heat-exposed (30 °C) parental seeds under natural conditions until anthesis. Then plants were divided into three treatment groups—control [parental plants] – control [subsequent plants] (CC, 25 °C), control–heat (CH, 30 °C), and heat–heat (HH, 30 °C). Plants grown from heat-stressed seeds had thicker and shorter flag leaves, which delayed leaf senescence and improved photosynthesis under heat stress. HH plants also had significantly less chalkiness than those of CH plants. DNA methylation analysis revealed that heat stress during grain filling significantly hypomethylated promoters of starch biosynthesis genes and hypermethylated those of α-amylase genes. Consequently, HH plants had significantly higher expression of starch biosynthesis genes and suppressed expression of starch-degrading α-amylase genes than CH plants under heat stress. We propose that heat stress during grain filling induces adaptive transgenerational memory that allows subsequent plants to better cope with heat stress. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Grain Filling; Heat Stress; Rice; Thermotolerance; Transgenerational Memory; Starch; Plant Proteins; Starch; Plant Protein; Starch; Biosynthesis; Dna Methylation; Food Grain; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Heat Shock Response; Heat Tolerance; High Temperature; Metabolism; Oryza; Photosynthesis; Physiological Adaptation; Physiology; Plant Leaf; Plant Seed; Adaptation, Physiological; Dna Methylation; Edible Grain; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Heat-shock Response; Hot Temperature; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Seeds; Starch; Thermotolerance","plant protein; starch; biosynthesis; DNA methylation; food grain; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; heat shock response; heat tolerance; high temperature; metabolism; Oryza; photosynthesis; physiological adaptation; physiology; plant leaf; plant seed; Adaptation, Physiological; DNA Methylation; Edible Grain; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Heat-Shock Response; Hot Temperature; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Seeds; Starch; Thermotolerance","","starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Plant Proteins; Starch","","Peng, Shaobing, Rice yields decline with higher night temperature from global warming, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101, 27, pp. 9971-9975, (2004); Yamakawa, Hiromoto, Comprehensive expression profiling of rice grain filling-related genes under high temperature using DNA microarray, Plant Physiology, 144, 1, pp. 258-277, (2007); Tanamachi, Koichiro, Differential responses to high temperature during maturation in heat-stress-tolerant cultivars of Japonica rice, Plant Production Science, 19, 2, pp. 300-308, (2016); Miyahara, Katsunori, Identification of chromosome regions for high-temperature tolerance in the japonica rice cultivar ‘Genkitsukushi’ (Oryza sativa L.), Plant Production Science, 26, 1, pp. 88-99, (2023); Hakata, Makoto, Suppression of α-amylase genes improves quality of rice grain ripened under high temperature, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 10, 9, pp. 1110-1117, (2012); Whittle, Carrie Ann, Adaptive epigenetic memory of ancestral temperature regime in Arabidopsis thaliana, Botany, 87, 6, pp. 650-657, (2009); Wang, Xiao, Heat priming induces trans-generational tolerance to high temperature stress in wheat, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, APR2016, (2016); Groot, Maartje P., Transgenerational effects of mild heat in Arabidopsis thaliana show strong genotype specificity that is explained by climate at origin, New Phytologist, 215, 3, pp. 1221-1234, (2017); He, Yuehui, Epigenetic Environmental Memories in Plants: Establishment, Maintenance, and Reprogramming, Trends in Genetics, 34, 11, pp. 856-866, (2018); Racette, Kelly A., Transgenerational stress memory of water deficit in peanut production, Field Crops Research, 248, (2020)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","40269183","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003395347"

Recent evidence shows that several AQPs, including plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), facilitate the electrogenic transport of ions as well as water transport and are referred to as ion-conducting aquaporins (icAQPs). The present study attempted to identify icAQPs that exhibit cation transport activity among PIPs from rice. Electrophysiological experiments on 11 OsPIPs using Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that OsPIP2;4 mediated the electrogenic transport of alkali monovalent cations with the selectivity sequence of Na+ ≈ K+ > Rb+ > Cs+ > Li+, suggesting non-selective cation conductance for Na+ and K+. Transcripts of OsPIP2;4 were abundant in the elongation and mature zones of roots with similar expression levels between the root stelar and remaining outer parts in the cultivar Nipponbare. Immunostaining using sections of the crown roots of Nipponbare plants revealed the expression of OsPIP2;4 in the exodermis and sclerenchyma of the surface region and in the endodermis and pericycle of the stelar region. The present results provide novel insights into OsPIP2;4-dependent non-selective Na+ and K+ transport and its physiological roles in rice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ion-conducting Aquaporins; Non-selective Cation Channel; Rice; Roots; Aquaporin; Potassium; Sodium; Water; Aquaporins; Plant Proteins; Potassium; Sodium; Water; Aquaporin; Plant Protein; Potassium; Sodium; Water; Animal; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Ion Transport; Metabolism; Oocyte; Oryza; Plant Root; Transport At The Cellular Level; Xenopus Laevis; Animals; Aquaporins; Biological Transport; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ion Transport; Oocytes; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Potassium; Sodium; Water","aquaporin; plant protein; potassium; sodium; water; animal; gene expression regulation; genetics; ion transport; metabolism; oocyte; Oryza; plant root; transport at the cellular level; Xenopus laevis; Animals; Aquaporins; Biological Transport; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ion Transport; Oocytes; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Potassium; Sodium; Water","","aquaporin, 215587-75-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; water, 7732-18-5; Aquaporins; Plant Proteins; Potassium; Sodium; Water","The authors would like to thank Mr. Yoshiyuki Tsuchiya (IPSR, Okayama Univ.) for his technical assistance.

These coatings are made from safe, natural ingredients such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), nano cellulose fibre (NCF), nano chitosan (N-Ch), and varying concentrations of green pomelo peel essential oil (GPO). The results revealed that the addition of GPO into coating/film significantly changed the pH, viscosity, and TSS values of the coating solutions while reducing film weight loss, particularly in the CCG3 film (61.93%). CCG3 also showed the strongest antibacterial effect against “Staphylococcus aureus” and maintained lower silkworm moisture content compared to other samples. Metabolic analysis revealed that certain compounds, such as 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid-3TMS and malic acid-3TMS, were more robust in CCG3. X-ray CT image analysis using image processing technology showed high accuracy, with the porosity area in the CCG3 sample being greater.

To understand factors affecting such flowering stage effects, we measure the differential effects of genotype (G), environmental stress (E), and genotype by environment interaction (G × E) on quinoa growth and yield-related traits during the flowering stage. A semi-controlled pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with five replications. Five quinoa genotypes (Q1, Cahuil, G18, Isluga, and Q3) were evaluated under four climate-related stress vs non-stress treatment conditions: control (E1), waterlogging (E2), salinity (E3), and drought (E4). Morphological and yield traits, including plant height, number of tillers and leaves, leaf area, soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, fresh and dry biomass, panicle length, 1000-grain weight, and individual grain yield were measured. There were significant effects of G, E, and G × E interaction on all measured traits, indicating considerable variation in genotype adaptability to abiotic stresses. The order of stress severity was E2 > E4 > E3 > E1, with waterlogging causing the most substantial reductions across growth and yield traits. The AMMI analysis highlighted strong genotype-specific responses across environments. Our findings provide insights into how quinoa responds to environmental stresses, supporting the development of research strategies and and irrigation management for quinoa under climate change related stresses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nitrogen; Phosphorus Pentoxide; Nitrogen; Phosphorus Pentoxide; Potassium Oxide; Unclassified Drug; Abiotic Stress; Article; Biomass; Breeding; Chenopodium Berlandieri; Chenopodium Quinoa; Chile; Climate; Climate Change; Drought; Dry Weight; Environmental Stress; Flowering; Fresh Weight; Genotype; Genotype Environment Interaction; Germplasm; Grain Yield; Greenhouse; Leaf Area; Panicle Length; Physiological Stress; Plant Height; Plant Leaf; Randomized Complete Block Design; Salinity; Seedling; Soil Moisture; Soil Plant Analysis Development; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Waterlogging; Flower; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Biomass; Droughts; Flowers; Gene-environment Interaction; Genotype; Salinity; Stress, Physiological","nitrogen; phosphorus pentoxide; potassium oxide; unclassified drug; abiotic stress; Article; biomass; breeding; Chenopodium berlandieri; Chenopodium quinoa; Chile; climate; climate change; drought; dry weight; environmental stress; flowering; fresh weight; genotype; genotype environment interaction; germplasm; grain yield; greenhouse; leaf area; panicle length; physiological stress; plant height; plant leaf; randomized complete block design; salinity; seedling; soil moisture; soil plant analysis development; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; waterlogging; flower; genetics; growth, development and aging; Biomass; Droughts; Flowers; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genotype; Salinity; Stress, Physiological","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus pentoxide, 1314-56-3","This research was supported by a Vietnam Ireland Bilateral Education Exchange (VIBE) program grant (funded by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs (Irish Aid) to Vietnam National University of Agriculture (Vietnam) and University of Galway (Ireland) to VLN and CS, respectively.

We propose Federated Normalized Loss-based Weighted Aggregation (FedNolowe) (Code is available at https://github.com/dongld-2020/fednolowe), a new method that weights client contributions using normalized training losses, favoring those with lower losses to improve global model stability. Unlike prior methods tied to dataset sizes or resource-heavy techniques, FedNolowe employs a two-stage L1 normalization, reducing computational complexity by 40% in floating-point operations while matching state-of-the-art performance. A detailed sensitivity analysis shows our two-stage weighting maintains stability in heterogeneous settings by mitigating extreme loss impacts while remaining effective in independent and identically distributed scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Aged; Article; Controlled Study; Federated Learning; Female; Human; Sensitivity Analysis; Algorithm; Machine Learning; Software; Algorithms; Federated Learning; Humans; Machine Learning; Software","adult; aged; article; controlled study; federated learning; female; human; sensitivity analysis; algorithm; machine learning; software; Algorithms; Federated Learning; Humans; Machine Learning; Software","","","","Communication Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data, (2016); Xu, Jie, Federated Learning for Healthcare Informatics, Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research, 5, 1, (2021); Guan, Hao, Federated learning for medical image analysis: A survey, Pattern Recognition, 151, (2024); Abdul Salam, Mustafa Abdul, COVID-19 detection using federated machine learning, PLOS ONE, 16, 6 June, (2021); Le, Duy Dong, Federated Learning in Smart Agriculture: An Overview, Proceedings - International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering, KSE, (2023); Federated Learning for Mobile Keyboard Prediction, (2018); Ren, Shuyang, A scalable blockchain-enabled federated learning architecture for edge computing, PLOS ONE, 19, 8 August, (2024); Aledhari, Mohammed, Federated Learning: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Protocols, and Applications, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 140699-140725, (2020); Kairouz, Peter, Advances and open problems in federated learning, Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, 14, 1-2, pp. 1-210, (2021); Zhu, Hangyu, Federated learning on non-IID data: A survey, Neurocomputing, 465, pp. 371-390, (2021)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","40811637","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013330894"

We evaluated the promises and limitations of this approach via a big team science competition. Twelve teams competed to predict self-reported affective experiences using a multi-modal set of peripheral nervous system measures. Models were trained and tested in multiple ways: with data divided by participants, targeted emotion, inductions, and time. In 100% of tests, teams outperformed baseline models that made random predictions. In 46% of tests, teams also outperformed baseline models that relied on the simple average of ratings from training datasets. More notably, results uncovered a methodological challenge: multiplicative constraints on generalizability. Inferences about the accuracy and theoretical implications of machine learning efforts depended not only on their architecture, but also how they were trained, tested, and evaluated. For example, some teams performed better when tested on observations from the same (vs. different) subjects seen during training. Such results could be interpreted as evidence against claims of universality. However, such conclusions would be premature because other teams exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, results illustrate how big team science can be leveraged to understand the promises and limitations of machine learning methods in affective science and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affective Computing; Big Team Science; Emotion; Generalizability; Machine Learning; Physiology","","","","R.O. was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00EDfico e Tecnol\u00F3gico (CNPq); S.-M.C. was supported by grant nos.

It has been hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal (EcM) in contrast to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can reduce tree species diversity in local communities, which remains to be tested at the global scale. To address this gap, we analyzed global forest inventory data and revealed that the relationship between tree species richness and EcM tree proportion varied along environmental gradients. Specifically, the relationship is more negative at low latitudes and in moist conditions but is unimodal at high latitudes and in arid conditions. The negative association of EcM tree proportion on species diversity at low latitudes and in humid conditions is likely due to more negative plant-soil microbial interactions in these regions. These findings extend our knowledge on the mechanisms shaping global patterns in plant species diversity from a belowground view. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abiotic; Association Reactions; Biotic; Ecosystems; Forest Ecology; Forestry; Fungi; Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi; Ectomycorrhizal; Forest Community; Forest Inventory Data; Global Scale; Local Community; Low Latitudes; Mycorrhizal Symbiosis; Tree Diversity; Tree Species Diversity; Copyrights; Biodiversity; Forest; Microbiology; Mycorrhiza; Physiology; Symbiosis; Tree; Biodiversity; Forests; Mycorrhizae; Soil Microbiology; Symbiosis; Trees","Abiotic; Association reactions; Biotic; Ecosystems; Forest ecology; Forestry; Fungi; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Ectomycorrhizal; Forest community; Forest inventory data; Global scale; Local community; Low latitudes; Mycorrhizal symbiosis; Tree diversity; Tree species diversity; Copyrights; biodiversity; forest; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; symbiosis; tree; Biodiversity; Forests; Mycorrhizae; Soil Microbiology; Symbiosis; Trees","","","We are deeply grateful to all members of the Global Forest Biodiversity initiative (GFBi), as well as the faculty and students at PKU, for efforts in field data collection and valuable data contributions to this study. especially, we thank to n.

At the turn of the twenty-first century, IBD incidence increased in newly industrialized and emerging regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the prevalence in early industrialized regions continued to grow steadily2, 3–4. Changes in the incidence and prevalence denote the evolution of IBD across four epidemiologic stages: stage 1 (emergence), characterized by low incidence and prevalence; stage 2 (acceleration in incidence), marked by rapidly rising incidence and low prevalence; and stage 3 (compounding prevalence), where the incidence decelerates, plateaus or declines while the prevalence steadily increases. A fourth stage (prevalence equilibrium) has been proposed in which the prevalence slope plateaus due to demographic shifts in an ageing IBD population, but it has not yet been evidenced. To date, these stages have remained theoretical, lacking specific numerical indicators to define transition points. Here, using real-world data from 522 population-based studies encompassing 82 global regions and spanning more than a century (1920–2024), we show spatiotemporal transitions across stages 1–3 and model stage 4 progression. Understanding the evolution of IBD across epidemiologic stages enables healthcare systems to better anticipate the future worldwide burden of IBD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mathematica V.13.1; Concentration (composition); Disease Incidence; Disease Prevalence; Epidemiology; Health Care; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Aging; Article; Crohn Disease; Evolution; Global Evolution; Health Care System; Human; Incidence; Industrialization; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Machine Learning; Mortality; North America; Prevalence; Systematic Review; Ulcerative Colitis; Adult; Disease Exacerbation; Female; Global Health; History; Male; Middle Aged; Africa; Asia; Europe; Latin America; Adult; Disease Progression; Female; Global Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Incidence; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Spatio-temporal Analysis","concentration (composition); disease incidence; disease prevalence; epidemiology; health care; spatiotemporal analysis; aging; Article; Crohn disease; evolution; global evolution; health care system; human; incidence; industrialization; inflammatory bowel disease; machine learning; mortality; North America; prevalence; systematic review; ulcerative colitis; adult; disease exacerbation; female; global health; history; male; middle aged; Africa; Asia; Europe; Latin America; Adult; Disease Progression; Female; Global Health; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Incidence; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Spatio-Temporal Analysis","","","This work was conducted by the Global Cluster of IOIBD.

We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna’s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Conservation Management; Data Set; Extinction; Fauna; Fishing; Marine Environment; Space Use; Tracking; Article; Endangered Species; Human; Nonhuman; Wildlife; Canada; China; Kunming; Montreal; Quebec [canada]; Yunnan","biodiversity; conservation management; data set; extinction; fauna; fishing; marine environment; space use; tracking; article; endangered species; human; nonhuman; wildlife; Canada; China; Kunming; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]; Yunnan","","","","UN high seas treaty is a landmark – but science needs to fill the gaps, Nature, 615, 7952, pp. 373-374, (2023); United Nations Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction; Long and Winding Road Negotiating A Treaty for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, (2018); 15th Conference of Parties Cop15, (2022); McCauley, Douglas J., Marine defaunation: Animal loss in the global ocean, Science, 347, 6219, (2015); Duarte, C.

Detecting and counting fish in water through video analysis is crucial for fish population statistics. This study employs AI algorithms, specifically YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once version 10) for identifying the presence fish in video frames, combined with the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm to count the number of fish individual moving across the frames. A total of 9,002 frames were extracted from 13 videos recorded in five different environments: areas with submerged tree roots, shallow marine regions, coral reefs, bleached coral reefs and seagrass meadows. To train the recognition model, the dataset was divided into training, validation and testing sets in 8:1:1 ratio. The results demonstrated that the model achieved an accuracy of 89.5%, with processing times of 6.2ms for preprocessing, 387.0ms for inference and 0.9ms for postprocessing per image.

Current treatments, including lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, and surgical interventions, focus primarily on symptom management but fail to address underlying genetic causes, often resulting in disease progression or recurrence. Gene therapy has emerged as a transformative approach, offering a potential treatment. This review explores its efficacy and safety in animal models, identifying opportunities for future advancements. Methods This review investigated studies on gene editing interventions in animal models of CVDs, retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science up to December 2024. Result A total of 57 studies were included in this review. Mice (86%) were the predominant model, with CRISPR-Cas9 (53%) and AAV vectors (80%) as the most used tools. Key targets included PCSK9 (32%), LDLR (9%), and MYH6/7 (7%), achieving 25–85% editing efficiency in liver/heart tissues. Base editors (ABE/CBE) showed superior safety, with <1% off-targets versus CRISPR-Cas9’s 2–5 off-targets per guide. Reported toxicity risks included liver injury (AAVs, 23%) and transient cytokine elevation (LNPs, 14%). Conclusion Gene editing therapy shows great potential for treating CVDs, with high efficiency, strong therapeutic outcomes, and favorable safety in animal models. Continued innovation and rigorous evaluation could transform cardiovascular treatment, benefiting patients with untreatable conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dystrophin; Proprotein Convertase 9; Serine Protease Htra1; Serine Proteinase; Adeno Associated Virus Vector; Dystrophin; Lipid Nanoparticle; Proprotein Convertase 9; Transcription Activator Like Effector Nuclease; Amyloidosis; Article; Atherosclerosis; Atrial Fibrillation; Barth Syndrome; Cardiovascular Disease; Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Crispr-cas9 System; Data Extraction; Dilated Cardiomyopathy; Disease Exacerbation; Drug Therapy; Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy; Electroporation; Gene Editing; Gene Therapy; Heart Failure; Hypercholesterolemia; Hyperlipidemia; Hypertriglyceridemia; Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; Immunogenicity; Lifestyle Modification; Liver Injury; Long Qt Syndrome; Niemann Pick Disease; Nonhuman; Outcome Assessment; Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews And Meta-analyses; Quality Control; Randomization; Rna Editing; Animal; Crispr Cas System; Dependoparvovirus; Disease Model; Genetics; Human; Mouse; Procedures; Therapy; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Crispr-cas Systems; Dependovirus; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Editing; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Mice","adeno associated virus vector; dystrophin; lipid nanoparticle; proprotein convertase 9; transcription activator like effector nuclease; amyloidosis; Article; atherosclerosis; atrial fibrillation; Barth syndrome; cardiovascular disease; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; cost effectiveness analysis; CRISPR-CAS9 system; data extraction; dilated cardiomyopathy; disease exacerbation; drug therapy; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; electroporation; gene editing; gene therapy; heart failure; hypercholesterolemia; hyperlipidemia; hypertriglyceridemia; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; immunogenicity; lifestyle modification; liver injury; long QT syndrome; Niemann Pick disease; nonhuman; outcome assessment; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; quality control; randomization; RNA editing; animal; CRISPR Cas system; Dependoparvovirus; disease model; genetics; human; mouse; procedures; therapy; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Dependovirus; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Editing; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Mice","","dystrophin, 116978-02-0; proprotein convertase 9; serine protease HTRA1; serine proteinase","","Ma, Liyuan, China cardiovascular diseases report 2018: An updated summary, Journal of Geriatric Cardiology, 17, 1, pp. 1-8, (2020); Martin, Seth S., 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics: A Report of US and Global Data from the American Heart Association, Circulation, 149, 8, pp. E347-E913, (2024); Roth, Gregory A., Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors, 1990-2019: Update From the GBD 2019 Study, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 76, 25, pp. 2982-3021, (2020); Vrablík, M., Genetics of cardiovascular disease: How far are we from personalized cvd risk prediction and management?, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 22, 8, (2021); Zubielienė, Kristina, Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Its Current Diagnostics and Treatment Possibilities: A Literature Analysis, Medicina (Lithuania), 58, 11, (2022); Leopold, Jane A., Emerging role of precision medicine in cardiovascular disease, Circulation Research, 122, 9, pp. 1302-1315, (2018); Grisorio, Luca, Gene therapy for cardiac diseases: methods, challenges, and future directions, Cardiovascular Research, 120, 14, pp. 1664-1682, (2024); Malech, Harry L., Evolution of Gene Therapy, Historical Perspective, Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America, 36, 4, pp. 627-645, (2022); Wang, Dan, Adeno-associated virus vector as a platform for gene therapy delivery, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 18, 5, pp. 358-378, (2019); Abdelnour, Sameh A., The Potential of CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing as a Treatment Strategy for Inherited Diseases, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 9, (2021)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","40465697","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007314744"

Timely correction of refractive errors can significantly improve visual function and daily life. This study examined the impact of spectacle use on the academic performance of schoolchildren with reduced visual acuity (VA) and myopia. Methods This cross-sectional study included 647 students from five secondary schools in Hue City, Vietnam. Students underwent comprehensive eye examinations, including VA, autorefractometry, and axial length measurements, and a structured questionnaire was completed. The primary outcome was academic performance, based on grade point average (GPA), math, and literature scores. Generalized linear models were utilized to examine the association between spectacle use and students’ academic performance. Results The mean spherical equivalent was −0.92±1.62 diopters, and the mean axial length was 23.32±1.07mm. The prevalence of reduced VA (uncorrected VA≤7/10) and myopia (spherical equivalent≤ −0.5 diopters) was 23.2% and 48.7%, respectively. Almost two-thirds of myopic students did not wear spectacles. Spectacle use was found to be significantly associated with an increased GPA (β=0.462; 95% confidence interval=0.108–0.816), math scores (β=0.517; 95% confidence interval = 0.015–1.020), and literature scores (β = 0.438; 95% confidence interval = 0.074–0.802) among students with reduced VA, and with increased literature scores (β = 0.277; 95% confidence interval = 0.046–0.509) among students with myopia. Conclusions Refractive errors, particularly myopia, are major health concerns among secondary school students in Vietnam. Despite the need for corrective spectacles, many students do not wear them, exacerbating their vision problems. This study highlights the benefits of spectacles in improving academic performance for students with reduced VA and myopia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ibm Spss Statistics For Windows Version 22.0; Academic Performance; Article; Cataract; Child; Cohort Analysis; Cross-sectional Study; Emmetropia; Eye Axis Length; Eye Examination; Female; Human; Hypermetropia; Major Clinical Study; Male; Myopia; Refraction Error; School Child; Social Media; Structured Questionnaire; Uncorrected Visual Acuity; Viet Nam; Vision; Visual Acuity; Visual Impairment; Academic Achievement; Adolescent; Epidemiology; Pathophysiology; School; Southeast Asian; Spectacles; Student; Therapy; Academic Performance; Adolescent; Child; Cross-sectional Studies; Eyeglasses; Female; Humans; Male; Myopia; Schools; Southeast Asian People; Students; Vietnam; Visual Acuity","academic performance; Article; cataract; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; emmetropia; eye axis length; eye examination; female; human; hypermetropia; major clinical study; male; myopia; refraction error; school child; social media; structured questionnaire; uncorrected visual acuity; Viet Nam; vision; visual acuity; visual impairment; academic achievement; adolescent; epidemiology; pathophysiology; school; Southeast Asian; spectacles; student; therapy; Academic Performance; Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Eyeglasses; Female; Humans; Male; Myopia; Schools; Southeast Asian People; Students; Vietnam; Visual Acuity","","","This work is partly supported by Japanese Society for Promotion of Science Grant (17H02164).

Four concrete mixtures were prepared for the investigation including a control mixture, SP2 mixture (4.7% SP2), SCBA mixture (5% SCBA), and SP2-SCBA mixture (4.7% SP2 and 5% SCBA). The SP2 mixture exhibited superior performance across all assessed engineering properties in comparison to the other mixtures. Moreover, a comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of untreated SCBA used in this study versus processed SCBA from recent research. Remarkably, untreated SCBA, despite having minimal impact on compressive strength, it demonstrated notable improvements in tensile strength. When combined with 4.7% SP2, the untreated SCBA mixture achieved a remarkable 37.9% increase in splitting tensile strength compared to the control mixture, outperforming similar mixtures using processed SCBA and silica fume in previous studies. Microstructure analysis revealed a large amount of spongy, fibrous hydrated structures in both the SCBA and SP2-SCBA mixtures. These structures provide a rational explanation to the increase in splitting tensile strength of the concrete containing SCBA. The findings highlight the tradeoff between using untreated SCBA and treated SCBA as sustainable cement replacements. Although untreated SCBA can only be used at a low replacement level, it offers unique engineering benefits alongside significant energy savings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compressive Strength; Sorptivity; Splitting Tensile Strength; Sugarcane Bagasse Ash; Sulfate Resistance Mineral Admixture; Water Absorption; Silicon Dioxide; Sulfate; Cement; Concrete; Mineral; Silicon Dioxide; Sulfate; Article; Ash; Bagasse; Compressive Strength; Controlled Study; Drug Analysis; Energy Conservation; Fume; Sugarcane; Tensile Strength; Water Absorption","cement; concrete; mineral; silicon dioxide; sulfate; article; ash; bagasse; compressive strength; controlled study; drug analysis; energy conservation; fume; sugarcane; tensile strength; water absorption","","silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; sulfate, 14808-79-8","This study has received funding from Mientrung University of Civil Engineering (MUCE), Vietnam.

This study examined the influence of psychological capital on mental health issues among unemployed people in Vietnam as well as the moderating role of self-esteem in this relation. Methods The study adopted a quantitative, cross-sectional approach with 468 recently unemployed office workers in 2023. The participants ranged from ages 22 to 49 years and worked in different fields including technology, finance, consumer services, and infrastructure services. Result The results indicated severe to extremely severe mental health symptoms, with 54.5%, 50.9%, and 38.9% of respondents reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Our results have shown that psychological capital can significantly predict mental health issues including depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal ideation. Self-esteem was found to play a moderating role in the relation between psychological capital and stress, depression, and suicidal ideation but not anxiety. Conclusions Businesses or government agencies should provide mental health support for unemployed workers.

The proposed controller synergistically combines an Optimized Fuzzy Logic Controller (OFLC) with Sliding Mode Control (SMC), leveraging the strengths of both techniques to achieve superior performance. The integration of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) into the OFLC significantly enhances its adaptability and precision, while the SMC law provides robust disturbance rejection and system stability. Another key innovation in this framework is the incorporation of an Extended State Observer (ESO), which ensures accurate state estimation and reduces sensor dependency. The most significant physical outcome of this work is the demonstrated improvement in the system’s stability and robustness, even under external disturbances and uncertainties, showcasing the potential of the proposed control framework to achieve precise, stability control in nonlinear systems like the RIP. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, demonstrating significant improvements in stability, disturbance rejection, and control precision, even under disturbance. The results highlight the potential of this approach as a robust solution for complex control systems, offering a significant advancement in the field of nonlinear system control with wide-ranging applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disturbance Rejection; Extended State Observer; Fuzzy Logic Control; Modified Membership Function; Particle Swarm Optimization; Rotary Inverted Pendulum; Sliding Mode Control; Article; Control Strategy; Control System; Electric Potential; Fuzzy Logic; Nonlinear System; Particle Swarm Optimization; Simulation","article; control strategy; control system; electric potential; fuzzy logic; nonlinear system; particle swarm optimization; simulation","","","","Yang, Yi, Optimal fractional-order proportional–integral–derivative control enabling full actuation of decomposed rotary inverted pendulum system, Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, 45, 10, pp. 1986-1998, (2023); Pham, Duc Binh, Robust-optimal control of rotary inverted pendulum control through fuzzy descriptor-based techniques, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Nguyen, Van Anh, Enhancing stability control of inverted pendulum using Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model with disturbance rejection and input–output constraints, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Hasan, Mustafa Wassef, An adaptive neural network with nonlinear FOPID design of underwater robotic vehicle in the presence of disturbances, uncertainty, and obstacles, Ocean Engineering, 279, (2023); Fei, Juntao, Fuzzy Neural Super-Twisting Sliding-Mode Control of Active Power Filter Using Nonlinear Extended State Observer, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 54, 1, pp. 457-470, (2024); Gonzales-Zurita, Óscar, PSO Tuning of a Second-Order Sliding-Mode Controller for Adjusting Active Standard Power Levels for Smart Inverter Applications, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 14, 6, pp. 4182-4193, (2023); Arulmozhi, N., Optimization Reinforced PID-Sliding Mode Controller for Rotary Inverted Pendulum, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 24420-24430, (2023); Bajodah, Abdulrahman H., Rotary inverted pendulum control using neuro-adaptive robust generalized dynamic inversion, JVC/Journal of Vibration and Control, 31, 7-8, pp. 1427-1437, (2025); Ben Hazem, Zied, Study of Q-learning and deep Q-network learning control for a rotary inverted pendulum system, Discover Applied Sciences, 6, 2, (2024); Kamarudin, Muhammad Nizam, State Feedback Via Judicious Pole Placement and Linear Quadratic Regulator – Application to Rotary Inverted Pendulum, International Journal of Integrated Engineering, 16, 5, pp. 1-9, (2024)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","39732779","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213521727"

This study aimed to develop a robust machine learning-based risk score to predict the need for MV in children with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) who developed acute respiratory failure. Methods This single-institution retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Vietnam between 2013 and 2022. The primary outcome was severe respiratory failure requiring MV in the children with DSS. Key covariables were predetermined by the LASSO method, literature review, and clinical expertise, including age (< 5 years), female patients, early onset day of DSS (＜day 4), large cumulative fluid infusion, higher colloid-to-crystalloid fluid infusion ratio, severe bleeding, severe transaminitis, low platelet counts (< 20 x 109 /L), elevated hematocrit, and high vasoactive-inotropic score. These covariables were analyzed using supervised models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was used to assess feature contribution. Results A total of 1,278 patients were included, with a median patient age of 8.1 years (IQR: 5.4– 10.7). Among them, 170 patients (13.3%) with DSS required mechanical ventilation. A significantly higher fatality rate was observed in the MV group than that in the non-MV group (22.4% vs. 0.1%). The RF and SVM models showed the highest model discrimination. The SHAP model explained the significant predictors. Internal validation of the predictive model showed high consistency between the predicted and observed data, with a good slope calibration in training (test) sets 1.0 (0.934), and a low Brier score of 0.04. Complete-case analysis was used to construct the risk score. Conclusions We developed a robust machine learning-based risk score to estimate the need for MV in hospitalized children with DSS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alanine Aminotransferase; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Alanine Aminotransferase; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Acute Respiratory Failure; Article; Artificial Ventilation; Bicarbonate Blood Level; Breathing Rate; Child; Cohort Analysis; Controlled Study; Dengue Shock Syndrome; Disease Severity; Female; Hematocrit; Hemodynamics; Human; Intensive Care Unit; Machine Learning; Major Clinical Study; Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; Retrospective Study; Risk Factor; School Child; Scoring System; Sensitivity And Specificity; Thrombocyte Transfusion; Treatment Response; Infant; Male; Mortality; Preschool Child; Respiratory Failure; Severe Dengue; Therapy; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Machine Learning; Male; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Insufficiency; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severe Dengue","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; acute respiratory failure; Article; artificial ventilation; bicarbonate blood level; breathing rate; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; dengue shock syndrome; disease severity; female; hematocrit; hemodynamics; human; intensive care unit; machine learning; major clinical study; pediatric intensive care unit; retrospective study; risk factor; school child; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; thrombocyte transfusion; treatment response; infant; male; mortality; preschool child; respiratory failure; severe dengue; therapy; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Machine Learning; Male; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Insufficiency; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severe Dengue","","alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9","","WHO Dengue and Severe Dengue, (2023); Dengue Guidelines for Diagnosis Treatment Prevention and Control, (2009); Nguyen, Thanh Tat, Associations of obesity and dengue-associated mortality, acute liver failure and mechanical ventilation in children with dengue shock syndrome, Medicine (United States), 102, 46, (2023); Nguyen Tat, Thanh, Prognostic values of serum lactate-to-bicarbonate ratio and lactate for predicting 28-day in-hospital mortality in children with dengue shock syndrome, Medicine (United States), 103, 17, (2024); Sachdev, Anil, Early Predictors of Mortality in Children with Severe Dengue Fever: A Prospective Study, Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, 40, 9, pp. 797-801, (2021); Laoprasopwattana, Kamolwish, Mortality Rates of Severe Dengue Viral Infection before and after Implementation of a Revised Guideline for Severe Dengue, Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, 41, 3, pp. 211-216, (2022); Vo, Luan Thanh, Combined Therapeutic Plasma Exchange and Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy in Children With Dengue-Associated Acute Liver Failure and Shock Syndrome: Single-Center Cohort From Vietnam, Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, 24, 10, pp. 818-828, (2023); Preeprem, Nutnicha, Paediatric dengue shock syndrome and acute respiratory failure: a single-centre retrospective study, BMJ Paediatrics Open, 6, 1, (2022); Vo, Luan Thanh, Pediatric Profound Dengue Shock Syndrome and Use of Point-of-Care Ultrasound during Mechanical Ventilation to Guide Treatment: Single-Center Retrospective Study, 2013-2021, Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, 25, 4, pp. E177-E185, (2024); Chen, Chinming, The outcomes of patients with severe dengue admitted to intensive care units, Medicine (United States), 95, 31, (2016)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","39642139","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211739202"

Despite the worldwide genetic, cultural, and environmental variations in determinants of CVDs, few studies have attempted the identification of risk factors of CVDs in low- and middle-income countries. This article aims to introduce the Khánh Hòa Cardiovascular Study, a prospective cohort study among middle-aged community dwellers in rural Khánh Hòa, Vietnam. A total of 3000 individuals, aged 40–60 years at baseline, participated in the baseline survey conducted from June 2019 to June 2020 and will be followed up for the subsequent 10 years. The baseline survey collected information on sociodemographic variables, disease history, lifestyle, social environment, and mental health via questionnaires, physical examinations, and biochemical measurements. Information on the incidence of severe health outcomes (i.e., mortality, CVDs, and cancer) has been and will be collected using a study-specific disease registry. Results showed that the prevalences of excess body weight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were 25.9%, 39.6%, 10.2%, and 45.1%, respectively. Furthermore, by March 2023, 21 participants had died, including 5 CVD deaths and 12 cancer deaths. Moreover, we recorded 22 and 31 cases of nonfatal CVDs and cancer, respectively. These results suggest that many rural residents in Vietnam have high cardiometabolic risk, and underscore the importance of advancing research to identify risk factors and prevent the onset of serious health events. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C Reactive Protein; C Reactive Protein; High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Triacylglycerol; Adult; Article; Body Mass; Body Weight; Cardiovascular Disease; Cardiovascular Risk; Cohort Analysis; Community; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Burden; Dyslipidemia; Female; Follow Up; Health Care Survey; Human; Human Experiment; Hypertension; Male; Malnutrition; Mental Health; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Middle Income Country; Obesity; Physical Activity; Prospective Study; Questionnaire; Risk Factor; Social Determinants Of Health; Sociodemographics; Epidemiology; Independent Living; Prevalence; Rural Population; Viet Nam; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Dyslipidemias; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Independent Living; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Vietnam","C reactive protein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; community; diabetes mellitus; disease burden; dyslipidemia; female; follow up; health care survey; human; human experiment; hypertension; male; malnutrition; mental health; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; middle income country; obesity; physical activity; prospective study; questionnaire; risk factor; social determinants of health; sociodemographics; epidemiology; independent living; prevalence; rural population; Viet Nam; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Dyslipidemias; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Independent Living; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Vietnam","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4","This work was supported by The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (19A06, 22A02 awarded to YI), The Pfizer Health Research Foundation (awarded to YI), and The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKANHI) (JP19K20536, JP23H03638 awarded to YI, JP21J01171 awarded to Aki Yazawa, JP21K17301 awarded to Dong Van Hoang).

Here, APOBEC3B, HIF-1α, KRAS, and PIK3CA were examined in patients with and without endometriosis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The apoptosis, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and biological function of APOBEC3B knockdown were explored in 12Z immortalized human endometriotic cell line. We observed APOBEC3B, HIF-1α, KRAS and PIK3CA expressions were significantly higher in endometriosis patients (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.029, p = 0.001). Knockdown of APOBEC3B increased apoptosis, which was 28.03% and 22.27% higher than in mock and control siRNA samples, respectively. APOBEC3B knockdown also decreased PIK3CA expression and increased Caspase 8 expression, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of APOBEC3B significantly inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration compared to mock and control siRNA. (Cell proliferation: mock: p < 0.001 and control siRNA: p = 0.049. Cell invasion: mock: p < 0.001 and control siRNA: p = 0.029. Cell migration: mock: p = 0.004, and control siRNA: p = 0.014).

In this study, we present evidence that the symbiosis between Vigna radiata and Bradyrhizobium elkanii USDA61 is controlled by a T3E called NopP2, and this interaction is highly dependent on the genetic makeup of the host plant. NopP2 plays a crucial role in promoting nodulation in various V. radiata varieties. Additionally, NopP2 is essential for early infection and the formation of nodules in compatible plants. Through evolutionary analysis, we discovered that bradyrhizobial NopPs can be categorized into two distinct clusters: NopP1 and NopP2. Furthermore, both types of bradyrhizobial NopPs were conserved within their respective groups. Our findings suggest that NopP2 serves as a mechanism for optimizing the symbiotic relationship between V. radiata and B. elkanii USDA61 by interacting with the pathogenesis related-10 (PR10) protein and reducing effector-triggered immunity (ETI) responses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bradyrhizobium Elkanii Usda61; Effector Protein Nopp; Pathogenesis Related-10 (pr10) Protein; T3ss; Vigna Radiata; Bacterial Proteins; Plant Proteins; Bacterial Protein; Plant Protein; Bradyrhizobium; Genetics; Metabolism; Microbiology; Nodulation; Phylogeny; Physiology; Symbiosis; Vigna; Bacterial Proteins; Bradyrhizobium Elkanii; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Plant Root Nodulation; Symbiosis","bacterial protein; plant protein; Bradyrhizobium; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; nodulation; phylogeny; physiology; symbiosis; Vigna; Bacterial Proteins; Bradyrhizobium elkanii; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Plant Root Nodulation; Symbiosis","","Bacterial Proteins; Plant Proteins","This work was supported by (i) Suranaree University of Technology (SUT), (ii) Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI), and (iii) National Science, Research, and Innovation Fund (NSRF) (grant number 195582), (iv) NSRF via the Program Management Unit for Human Resources & Institutional Development, Research, and Innovation (grant number B13F660055), (v) JSPS-NRCT by National Research Council of Thailand (grant number N11A670769).

The aim of our study was to provide a standardized analysis and description of the Vietnamese bat echolocation calls. We analyzed call recordings of 87 species arranged in eight families. This constitutes 74% of the echolocating bats presently known in Vietnam and includes the first call descriptions for five taxa.

This study comprehensively analyses stroke incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) across India from 1990 to 2021, using the latest Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data. We evaluate how Universal Health Coverage (UHC), health expenditure, human development index (HDI), and gross national income (GNI) influence stroke outcomes. Our findings reveal significant regional disparities, with higher stroke rates in urban areas and states like Goa and Kerala. Higher health expenditure and HDI are linked to lower stroke rates, while higher GNI per capita correlates with increased stroke incidence, likely due to lifestyle changes. Risk factors include air pollution, tobacco use, dietary risks, and high blood pressure. Air pollution notably impacts stroke mortality in Bihar and Jharkhand, while tobacco use is a major risk factor in Mizoram and Manipur. Dietary risks and hypertension are prevalent in Maharashtra and Jammu & Kashmir. The study highlights the need for targeted public health strategies addressing regional disparities and socioeconomic factors. Policymakers should focus on lifestyle modification programs, public awareness campaigns, and enhanced access to quality stroke care to reduce stroke-related morbidity and mortality effectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global Burden Of Disease; Regional Disparities; Risk Factors; Stroke Burden; Universal Health Coverage; Adult; Aged; Cerebrovascular Accident; Cost Of Illness; Disability-adjusted Life Year; Epidemiology; Etiology; Female; Global Disease Burden; Health Care Cost; Human; Incidence; India; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factor; Socioeconomics; Adult; Aged; Cost Of Illness; Disability-adjusted Life Years; Female; Global Burden Of Disease; Health Expenditures; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Stroke","adult; aged; cerebrovascular accident; cost of illness; disability-adjusted life year; epidemiology; etiology; female; global disease burden; health care cost; human; incidence; India; male; middle aged; risk factor; socioeconomics; Adult; Aged; Cost of Illness; Disability-Adjusted Life Years; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Health Expenditures; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Stroke","","","We would like to thank the Institute of Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME) for providing data access support for this study.\u00A0We would also like to thank the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI), Tokyo, Japan,\u00A0for the support to this project.

Although recent progress in quantum engineering has assisted in creating advanced quantum magnetometers, there are still ongoing challenges in improving their efficiency and noise resistance. This study focuses on using symmetric graph state resources for quantum magnetometry to enhance measurement precision by analyzing the estimation theory under time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous noise models. The results show a significant improvement in estimating both single and multiple Larmor frequencies. In single Larmor frequency estimation, the quantum Fisher information spans a spectrum from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit within a periodic range of the Larmor frequency, and in the case of multiple Larmor frequencies, it can exceed the standard quantum limit for both noisy cases. This study highlights the potential of graph state-based methods for improving magnetic field measurements under noisy environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Controlled Study; Diagnosis; Environmental Noise; Magnetic Field; Magnetometer; Magnetometry; Measurement Precision; Noise","article; controlled study; diagnosis; environmental noise; magnetic field; magnetometer; magnetometry; measurement precision; noise","","","This work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23K13025.","Degen, Christian L., Quantum sensing, Reviews of Modern Physics, 89, 3, (2017); Chalopin, Thomas, Quantum-enhanced sensing using non-classical spin states of a highly magnetic atom, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Pezzé, Luca, Quantum metrology with nonclassical states of atomic ensembles, Reviews of Modern Physics, 90, 3, (2018); Ho, Lebin, Modular-value-based metrology with spin coherent pointers, Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics, 383, 2-3, pp. 153-157, (2019); Friis, Nicolai, Flexible resources for quantum metrology, New Journal of Physics, 19, 6, (2017); Shettell, Nathan, Graph States as a Resource for Quantum Metrology, Physical Review Letters, 124, 11, (2020); Wang, Yunkai, Continuous-variable graph states for quantum metrology, Physical Review A, 102, 5, (2020); Le, Trung Kien, Variational quantum metrology for multiparameter estimation under dephasing noise, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Niezgoda, Artur, Many-Body Nonlocality as a Resource for Quantum-Enhanced Metrology, Physical Review Letters, 126, 21, (2021); Chu, Yaoming, Strong Quantum Metrological Limit from Many-Body Physics, Physical Review Letters, 130, 17, (2023)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","39227686","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203015624"

Guided by this perspective, we examined in a multinational and multicultural study (61 countries; N = 15,039) how narcissism forms are linked to cognitions and behaviors prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As expected, differences in cognitions and behaviors across narcissism forms emerged. For example, higher narcissistic rivalry predicted lower likelihood of enactment of COVID-19 prevention behaviors, but higher narcissistic sanctity predicted higher likelihood of enactment of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Further, whereas the heroism, admiration, and rivalry narcissism forms acted in a typically antisocial manner, with high narcissism predicting greater endorsement of unfounded health beliefs, the sanctity form acted in a prosocial manner, with higher narcissism being linked to lower endorsement of unfounded COVID-19 health beliefs. Thus, the findings (a) support the idea of four narcissism forms acting differently, and (b) show that these differences reflect a double-edged sword, sometimes linking to an anti-social orientation, and sometimes linking to a pro-social orientation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Epidemiology; Female; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Narcissism; Pandemic; Psychology; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Young Adult; Adult; Covid-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Narcissism; Pandemics; Sars-cov-2; Young Adult","adult; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; female; human; male; middle aged; narcissism; pandemic; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; young adult; Adult; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Narcissism; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult","","","The work of Magdalena \u017Bemojtel-Piotrowska and Jaros\u0142aw Piotrowski was supported by grant 2017/26/E/HS6/00282 from the National Science Centre, Poland.

COVID-19 mortality risk estimators are often, however, developed with small unrepresentative samples and with methodological limitations. It is highly important to develop predictive tools for pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients as one of the most severe preventable complications of COVID-19. Early recognition can help provide life-saving targeted anti-coagulation therapy right at admission. Using a dataset of more than 800,000 COVID-19 patients from an international cohort, we propose a cost-sensitive gradient-boosted machine learning model that predicts occurrence of PE and death at admission. Logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and Shapley values were used to identify key predictors for PE and death. Our prediction model had a test AUROC of 75.9% and 74.2%, and sensitivities of 67.5% and 72.7% for PE and all-cause mortality respectively on a highly diverse and held-out test set. The PE prediction model was also evaluated on patients in UK and Spain separately with test results of 74.5% AUROC, 63.5% sensitivity and 78.9% AUROC, 95.7% sensitivity. Age, sex, region of admission, comorbidities (chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, obesity, smoking), and symptoms (any, confusion, chest pain, fatigue, headache, fever, muscle or joint pain, shortness of breath) were the most important clinical predictors at admission. Age, overall presence of symptoms, shortness of breath, and hypertension were found to be key predictors for PE using our extreme gradient boosted model. This analysis based on the, until now, largest global dataset for this set of problems can inform hospital prioritisation policy and guide long term clinical research and decision-making for COVID-19 patients globally. Our machine learning model developed from an international cohort can serve to better regulate hospital risk prioritisation of at-risk patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Aged; Cohort Analysis; Complication; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Epidemiology; Female; Hospitalization; Human; Isolation And Purification; Lung Embolism; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Risk Factor; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Spain; United Kingdom; Very Elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Cohort Studies; Covid-19; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Embolism; Risk Factors; Sars-cov-2","adult; aged; cohort analysis; complication; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; female; hospitalization; human; isolation and purification; lung embolism; machine learning; male; middle aged; mortality; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Spain; United Kingdom; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; COVID-19; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Embolism; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2","","","Funding text 1: This work was made possible by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Wellcome [215091/Z/18/Z, 222410/Z/21/Z, 225288/Z/22/Z and 220757/Z/20/Z]; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1209135]; the philanthropic support of the donors to the University of Oxford\u2019s COVID-19 Research Response Fund (0009109); CIHR Coronavirus Rapid Research Funding Opportunity OV2170359 and the coordination in Canada by Sunnybrook Research Institute; endorsement of the Irish Critical Care-Clinical Trials Group, co-ordination in Ireland by the Irish Critical Care-Clinical Trials Network at University College Dublin and funding by the Health Research Board of Ireland [CTN-2014-12]; the Rapid European COVID-19 Emergency Response research (RECOVER) [H2020 project 101003589] and European Clinical Research Alliance on Infectious Diseases (ECRAID) [965313]; the COVID clinical management team, AIIMS, Rishikesh, India; the COVID-19 Clinical Management team, Manipal Hospital Whitefield, Bengaluru, India; Cambridge NIHR Biomedical Research Centre; the dedication and hard work of the Groote Schuur Hospital Covid ICU Team and supported by the Groote Schuur nursing and University of Cape Town registrar bodies coordinated by the Division of Critical Care at the University of Cape Town; the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the University of Oxford; the dedication and hard work of the Norwegian SARS-CoV-2 study team and the Research Council of Norway grant no 312780, and a philanthropic donation from Vivaldi Invest A/S owned by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner; Imperial NIHR Biomedical Research Centre; the Comprehensive Local Research Networks (CLRNs) of which PJMO is an NIHR Senior Investigator (NIHR201385); Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under Grant Agreement No. 115523 COMBACTE, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007- 2013) and EFPIA companies, in-kind contribution; Stiftungsfonds zur F\u00F6rderung der Bek\u00E4mpfung der Tuberkulose und anderer Lungenkrankheiten of the City of Vienna, Project Number: APCOV22BGM; Italian Ministry of Health \u201CFondi Ricerca corrente-L1P6\u201D to IRCCS Ospedale Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria; Australian Department of Health grant (3273191); Gender Equity Strategic Fund at University of Queensland, Artificial Intelligence for Pandemics (A14PAN) at University of Queensland, the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems (EQUS, CE170100009), the Prince Charles Hospital Foundation, Australia; grants from Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ministerio de Ciencia, Spain; Brazil, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development Scholarship number 303953/2018-7; the Firland Foundation, Shoreline, Washington, USA; the French COVID cohort (NCT04262921) is sponsored by INSERM and is funded by the REACTing (REsearch & ACtion emergING infectious diseases) consortium and by a grant of the French Ministry of Health (PHRC n20-0424); a grant from foundation Bevordering Onderzoek Franciscus; the South Eastern Norway Health Authority and the Research Council of Norway; Institute for Clinical Research (ICR), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported by the Ministry of Health Malaysia; preparedness work conducted by the Short Period Incidence Study of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection; the U.S. DoD Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Global Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch to the U.S Naval Medical Research Unit No. TWO (NAMRU-2) (Work Unit #: P0153_21_N2).

The composite consisted of a photoconductive polymer of poly((4-diphenylamino)benzyl acrylate), a photoconductive plasticizer of (4-diphenylamino)phenyl)methanol, a sensitizer of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, and a nonlinear optical dye of (4-(azepan-1-yl)-benzylidene)malononitrile. The photorefractive properties and related quantities were dependent on the composition, which was related to the glass transition temperature of the photorefractive polymers. The quantum efficiency (QE) of photocarrier generation was evaluated from the initial slope of the transient photocurrent. Transient photocurrents were measured and showed two unique peaks: one in the range of 10−4 to 10−3 s and the other in the range of 10−1 to 1 s. The transient photocurrents was well simulated (or reproduced) by the expanded two-trapping site model with two kinds of photocarrier generation and recombination processes and two different trapping sites. The obtained photorefractive quantity of trap density was significantly related to the photoconductive parameters of QE. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric Energy Transfer; Diffraction Efficiency; Photorefractive Properties; Response Time; Transient Photocurrent; Two Beam Coupling; Acrylic Acid; Butyric Acid; Malononitrile; Methanol; Acrylic Acid; Butyric Acid; Dye; Malononitrile; Methanol; Plasticizer; Polymer; Article; Controlled Study; Diffraction; Energy Transfer; Female; Genetic Recombination; Glass Transition Temperature; Nonhuman; Reaction Time; Sensitization; Simulation","acrylic acid; butyric acid; dye; malononitrile; methanol; plasticizer; polymer; article; controlled study; diffraction; energy transfer; female; genetic recombination; glass transition temperature; nonhuman; reaction time; sensitization; simulation","","acrylic acid, 10344-93-1, 79-10-7; butyric acid, 107-92-6, 156-54-7, 461-55-2; malononitrile, 109-77-3; methanol, 67-56-1","This work is supported by the Strategic Promotion of Innovative Research and Development (S-Innovation) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and is partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant no.

Participants were measured for LDL-p through nuclear magnetic resonance technology. 740 men participated in follow-up and underwent 1.5 T brain magnetic resonance angiography from 2012 to 2015. Participants were categorized as no-ICAS, and ICAS consisted of mild-ICAS (1 to < 50%) and severe-ICAS (≥ 50%) in any of the arteries examined. After exclusion criteria, 711 men left for analysis, we used multiple logistic regression to examine the association between lipid profiles and ICAS prevalence. Among the study participants, 205 individuals (28.8%) had ICAS, while 144 individuals (20.3%) demonstrated discordance between LDL-c and LDL-p levels. The discordance “low LDL-c–high LDL-p” group had the highest ICAS risk with an adjusted OR (95% CI) of 2.78 (1.55–5.00) in the reference of the concordance “low LDL-c–low LDL-p” group. This was followed by the concordance “high LDL-c–high LDL-p” group of 2.56 (1.69–3.85) and the discordance “high LDL-c–low LDL-p” group of 2.40 (1.29–4.46).

This study aimed to assess the quality of life (QoL) of people living in disadvantaged coastal communes (subdivision of Vietnam) and identify their associated factors by using the World Health Organization’s quality of life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF). To achieve this, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 595 individuals aged 18 years and above living in the coastal communes in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam, from October 2022 to February 2023. The results showed that the mean overall QoL (mean ± SD) was 61.1 ± 10.8. Among the four domains of QoL, the physical health (57.2 ± 12.3) domain had a lower score than the psychological health (61.9 ± 13.0), social relations (63.4 ± 13.4), and environment (61.9 ± 13.3) domains. The QoL score of the domains for participants affected by flooding was significantly lower than that of those not affected, except for social relations. Multivariable logistic regression showed that subjects with not good QoL had the educational background with no formal education (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.63, 95% CI 1.19–5.83), fairly poor/poor households (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.48–5.12), suffered Musculoskeletal diseases (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02–2.56), unsatisfaction with health status (OR = 5.27, 95% CI 2.44–11.37), family conflicts (OR = 4.51, 95%CI 2.10–9.69), and low levels of social support (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.14–6.02). The analysis also revealed that workers (OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04–0.66) had a better QoL than farmer-fisherman. QoL in disadvantaged coastal communes was low, with the lowest scores in the physical health domain. Based on the socioeconomic factors associated with not good QoL identified here, it is recommended that local authorities take more appropriate and practical measures to increase support, including measures for all aspects of physical health, psychological health, social relations, and the living environment, especially for people affected by floods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coastal Area; Flood; Quality Of Life; Whoqol-bref; Cross-sectional Study; Epidemiology; Health Status; Human; Psychology; Quality Of Life; Questionnaire; Viet Nam; Cross-sectional Studies; Health Status; Humans; Quality Of Life; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam","cross-sectional study; epidemiology; health status; human; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; Viet Nam; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Humans; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","","The authors would like to thank the students (Dr. Truong Huynh Anh Khoa and others) and the local volunteers who helped collect the data.

This article introduces the development of optimal and robust-optimal controllers grounded in the principles of stability control and fuzzy descriptor systems. By transforming complicated inequalities into linear matrix inequalities (LMI), we establish the essential conditions for controller construction, as delineated in theorems. To substantiate the utility of these controllers, we employ the rotary inverted pendulum as a testbed. Through diverse simulation scenarios, these controllers, rooted in fuzzy descriptor systems, demonstrate their practicality and effectiveness in ensuring the stable control of inverted pendulum systems, even in the presence of uncertainties within the model. This study highlights the adaptability and robustness of fuzzy descriptor-based controllers, paving the way for advanced control strategies in complex and uncertain environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Linear Matrix Inequality; Robust-optimal Control; Rotary Inverted Pendulum; Stability Control; T–s Fuzzy Descriptor Model; Article; Control Strategy; Fuzzy Logic; Male; Nonhuman; Simulation","article; control strategy; fuzzy logic; male; nonhuman; simulation","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2023 - PC - 036.","Takagi, Tomohiro, Fuzzy Identification of Systems and Its Applications to Modeling and Control, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-15, 1, pp. 116-132, (1985); Li, Ang, Adaptive sliding mode attitude tracking control for flexible spacecraft systems based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modelling method, Acta Astronautica, 175, pp. 570-581, (2020); Zhang, Jinggang, Design and Real-Time Implementation of Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Controller for Magnetic Levitation Ball System, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 38221-38228, (2020); Lopes, Adriano N.D., Anti-windup TS Fuzzy PI-like Control for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems with Saturated Actuators, International Journal of Fuzzy Systems, 22, 1, pp. 46-61, (2020); Zhang, Zhuo, New results on sliding-mode control for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy multiagent systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 5, pp. 1592-1604, (2019); Wei, Lingtao, T-S Fuzzy Model Predictive Control for Vehicle Yaw Stability in Nonlinear Region, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 70, 8, pp. 7536-7546, (2021); Precup, Radu Emil, Design and experiments for a class of fuzzy controlled servo systems, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 13, 1, pp. 22-35, (2008); Hua, Changchun, Stabilization of t-s fuzzy system with time delay under sampled-data control using a new looped-functional, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 28, 2, pp. 400-407, (2020); Liu, Yajuan, Stability and Stabilization of Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems via Sampled-Data and State Quantized Controller, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 24, 3, pp. 635-644, (2016); Islam, Syed Imranul, Robust fault detection of T-S fuzzy systems with time-delay using fuzzy functional observer, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 392, pp. 1-23, (2020)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","38454029","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187144245"

Here we show that at 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C of global warming, heat-related mortality in 800 locations across 50 countries/areas will increase by 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.5%, respectively; among which 1 in 5 to 1 in 4 heat-related deaths can be attributed to population aging. Despite a projected decrease in cold-related mortality due to progressive warming alone, population aging will mostly counteract this trend, leading to a net increase in cold-related mortality by 0.1%–0.4% at 1.5–3 °C global warming. Our findings indicate that population aging constitutes a crucial driver for future heat- and cold-related deaths, with increasing mortality burden for both heat and cold due to the aging population. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aging; Aging Population; Global Warming; Mortality; Temperature Effect; Adult; Age; Aged; Article; Climate Change; Cold; Death; Excess Mortality; Futurology; Geographic Names; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gas; Heat; Historical Period; Human; Mortality Rate; Population Projection; Population Size; Population Structure; Temperature; Article; Epidemiology; Female; Warming; Climate Change; Cold Temperature; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Mortality; Temperature","aging; aging population; global warming; mortality; temperature effect; adult; age; aged; Article; climate change; cold; death; excess mortality; futurology; geographic names; geography; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat; historical period; human; mortality rate; population projection; population size; population structure; temperature; article; epidemiology; female; warming; Climate Change; Cold Temperature; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Mortality; Temperature","","","We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme, which, through its Working Group on Coupled Modeling, coordinated and promoted CMIP6.

Vietnam, due to its rich biodiversity and cultural diversity, is a target country for the production of high-resolution LULC maps. This study introduces a high-resolution and high-accuracy LULC map for Vietnam, utilizing a CNN approach that performs convolution over a time-feature domain instead of the typical geospatial domain employed by conventional CNNs. By using multi-temporal data spanning 6 seasons, the produced LULC map achieved a high overall accuracy of 90.5% ± 1.2%, surpassing other 10-meter LULC maps for Vietnam in terms of accuracy and/or the ability to capture detailed features. In addition, a straightforward and practical approach was proposed for generating cloud-free multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images, particularly suitable for cloudy regions. This study marks the first implementation of the time-feature CNN approach for the creation of a high-accuracy LULC map in a tropical cloudy country. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Biodiversity; Climate Model; Convolutional Neural Network; Cultural Diversity; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Disaster Management; Drug Therapy; Environmental Protection; Japan; Land Use; Viet Nam","article; biodiversity; climate model; convolutional neural network; cultural diversity; diagnostic test accuracy study; disaster management; drug therapy; environmental protection; Japan; land use; Viet Nam","","","The article processing charge (APC) of this paper was supported by the research contract JX-PSPC-558032 and Mountain Science Center of University of Tsukuba.

Quantifying the consequences of unsustainable ongoing sand mining and hydropower is crucial for obtaining sediment load data and managing hydrogeomorphology. In this study, comprehensive long-term consecutive four-field monitoring, statistical methods, and hydrological models (SWAT) were applied to quantify the spatiotemporal changes in long-term discharge and sediment load from 1996 to 2020 for the tropical river of the Vu Gia Thu Bon (VGTB) in the central region of Vietnam. The SWAT model was calibrated from 1996 to 2010, validated from 2011 to 2020 and showed good performance for daily discharge and monthly sediment. The evolution of river bathymetric data (2010, 2015, 2018, and 2021) was analysed to clarify the upstream sediment supply trapped in the riverbed and how the sand mining volume was removed. The results showed that the mean annual sediment in the Vu Gia and Thu Bon Rivers decreased by 57.3% and 23.8%, respectively, in the postdam period compared with the predam period. The thalweg elevation decreased at the Ai Nghia and Giao Thuy stations from 2010 to 2021 by 1.8 m and 3.9 m, respectively. The water level decreased by 21.1% at Ai Nghia and 44.3% at Giao Thuy. Dam development, sand mining, and changes in land use are the main factors responsible for flow discharge and sediment morphodynamic alterations. Morphological change have increased the water transfer rate from the Vu Gia River to the Thu Bon River through the Quang Hue channel. Downstream of the Vu Gia River, water transfer and riverbed incision have decreased flow discharge and water level and increased saltwater intrusion in recent years. As a result, water shortages induced by saltwater intrusion during drought periods have emerged as a significant constraint in hindering the domestic water supply and agricultural production. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","River Water; Article; Budget; Controlled Study; Drought; Human; Hydrological Model; Hydropower; Incision; Land Use; Mining; River; River Basin; Sand; Sediment; Soil And Water Assessment Tool Model; Viet Nam; Water Supply","river water; article; budget; controlled study; drought; human; hydrological model; hydropower; incision; land use; mining; river; river basin; sand; sediment; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; Viet Nam; water supply","","","This work was funded by APN “Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research” under project reference number CRRP2020-09MYKantoush (Funder ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/100005536 ), Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), Research Unit for Realization of Sustainable Society (RURSS) at Kyoto University, JSPS Core-to-Core Program (Grant Number: JPJSCCB20220004), and JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships Program (Fellowship ID: P24064).","de Girolamo, Anna Maria, Simulating ecologically relevant hydrological indicators in a temporary river system, Agricultural Water Management, 180, pp. 194-204, (2017); Ahn, Kuk-hyun, Quantifying the relative impact of climate and human activities on streamflow, Journal of Hydrology, 515, pp. 257-266, (2014); Keesstra, Saskia D., Assessing riparian zone impacts on water and sediment movement: A new approach, Geologie en Mijnbouw/Netherlands Journal of Geosciences, 91, 1-2, pp. 245-255, (2012); Syvitski, James P.M., Sinking deltas due to human activities, Nature Geoscience, 2, 10, pp. 681-686, (2009); Boix-Fayos, Carolina, Effects of check dams, reforestation and land-use changes on river channel morphology: Case study of the Rogativa catchment (Murcia, Spain), Geomorphology, 91, 1-2, pp. 103-123, (2007); Gomez, Basil, Simulating changes to the sediment transport regime of the Waipaoa River, New Zealand, driven by climate change in the twenty-first century, Global and Planetary Change, 67, 3-4, pp. 153-166, (2009); Best, Jim L., Anthropogenic stresses on the world’s big rivers, Nature Geoscience, 12, 1, pp. 7-21, (2019); Binh, Doan Van, Effects of riverbed incision on the hydrology of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Hydrological Processes, 35, 2, (2021); MalekMohammadi, Bahram, Environmental Risk Assessment of Wetland Ecosystems Using Bayesian Belief Networks, Hydrology, 10, 1, (2023); Mahdian, Mehran, Modelling impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on inflows and sediment loads of wetlands: case study of the Anzali wetland, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","38216700","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182187435"

Numerous H. pylori virulence factors have been identified, showing extensive geographic variation1. Here we identify a ‘Hardy’ ecospecies of H. pylori that shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes, many of which encode outer membrane proteins and host interaction factors. Most Hardy strains have a second urease, which uses iron as a cofactor rather than nickel3, and two additional copies of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA. Hardy strains currently have a limited distribution, including in Indigenous populations in Siberia and the Americas and in lineages that have jumped from humans to other mammals. Analysis of polymorphism data implies that Hardy and Ubiquitous coexisted in the stomachs of modern humans since before we left Africa and that both were dispersed around the world by our migrations. Our results also show that highly distinct adaptive strategies can arise and be maintained stably within bacterial populations, even in the presence of continuous genetic exchange between strains. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Transfer Rna; Iron; Urease; Bacterial Proteins; Iron; Urease; Vaca Protein, Helicobacter Pylori; Virulence Factors; Illumina Miseq Platform; Illumina Nova Pe150 Platform; Cytotoxin; Transfer Rna; Bacterial Protein; Iron; Urease; Vaca Protein, Helicobacter Pylori; Virulence Factor; Ancestry; Bacterium; Cancer; Digestive System; Genome; Polymorphism; Virulence; Article; Bioinformatics; Chemotaxis; Dna Extraction; Ecotype; Endoscopy; Flow Cytometry; Gene Mapping; Genetic Analysis; Genome Analysis; Genome-wide Association Study; Geographical Variation (species); Haplotype; Helicobacter Pylori; Hidden Markov Model; Intestine Flora; Liver Abscess; Omnivore; Pangenome; Phylogenetic Tree; Phylogenomics; Phylogeny; Population Structure; Principal Component Analysis; Sequence Alignment; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Stomach Cancer; Whole Genome Sequencing; Animal; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Genome; Genetics; Helicobacter Infection; History; Human; Metabolism; Microbiology; Migration; Pathogenicity; Russian Federation; Stomach; Western Hemisphere; Africa; Siberia; Americas; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Genes, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Helicobacter Infections; Human Migration; Humans; Iron; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Stomach; Urease; Virulence Factors","cytotoxin; transfer RNA; bacterial protein; iron; urease; VacA protein, Helicobacter pylori; virulence factor; ancestry; bacterium; cancer; digestive system; genome; polymorphism; virulence; Article; bioinformatics; chemotaxis; DNA extraction; ecotype; endoscopy; flow cytometry; gene mapping; genetic analysis; genome analysis; genome-wide association study; geographical variation (species); haplotype; Helicobacter pylori; hidden Markov model; intestine flora; liver abscess; omnivore; pangenome; phylogenetic tree; phylogenomics; phylogeny; population structure; principal component analysis; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; stomach cancer; whole genome sequencing; animal; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; genetics; Helicobacter infection; history; human; metabolism; microbiology; migration; pathogenicity; Russian Federation; stomach; Western Hemisphere; Africa; Siberia; Americas; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Genes, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Helicobacter Infections; Human Migration; Humans; Iron; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Stomach; Urease; Virulence Factors","","transfer RNA, 9014-25-9; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; urease, 9002-13-5; Bacterial Proteins; Iron; Urease; VacA protein, Helicobacter pylori; Virulence Factors","We are grateful to the many research participants and health care professionals who facilitated sample collection efforts.

In particular, wavelet transform theory does not consider the effect of changes in digital signals on the result of the wavelet transform. This paper emphasizes the influence of the type of digital signals on the accuracy of wavelet transform in engineering applications and proposes an efficient wavelet function based on the derivative of the signal for better damage detection in beam structures. For this purpose, the obtained signals from the mode shapes of the steel beam are used to examine the efficiency of the proposed derivative-based wavelet transform. The effects of changes in boundary conditions, location of damage, and level of damage on the performance of the proposed method, are evaluated. Findings show that when we use the derivate of the signal in the wavelet transform, the location of damage in all damage scenarios is detected with high accuracy. This research demonstrates the importance of the type of signal used in the wavelet transform for enhancing the precision of fault and damage detection in signals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Damage Detection; Derivative-based Wavelet Transform; Signal Processing; Structural Health Monitoring; Wavelet Transform","","","","This research work was funded by Institutional Fund Projects under grant no.

The study compares the maximum principal stress in a damaged pipe under different composite patch designs. Robust models have been developed and utilized in various applications. The research investigates the influence of cracks on the mechanical characteristics of API X70 steel in a test pipe under critical pressure. The numerical model employs the extended finite element method (XFEM) to simulate notches. Extending the optimization technique, the study examines the effect of crack presence in a pipeline section under internal pressure without and with composite repairs on the maximum principal stress. The sensitivity of stress is analyzed with respect to the design parameters of the composite patch. Finally, YUKI-RANDOM-FOREST, NN-PSO-YUKI, and NN-BCMO, with different parameters and hidden layer sizes are employed to predict the maximum principal stress under different composite patch designs, and yielding minimal error. Once the database was built, our model was prepared to predict various situations at the composite patch level. Compared to other methods, the obtained results with hybrid YUKI-RANDOM-FOREST are effective. The investigation technique is relevant to real-world engineering applications, structural safety control, and design processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Composite Patch; Crack; Nn-bcmo; Nn-pso-yuki; Pipelines; Xfem; Yuki-random-forest","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Ho Chi Minh City Open University under the basic research fund (No. E2023.03.1).","Mohtadi-Bonab, M.

Upon infection, injury or malignancy the bone surface undergoes new growth—the periosteal reaction—but the mechanism and physiological role of this process remain unknown1,2. Here we show that the periosteal reaction protects against cancer invasion into the bone. Histological analyses of human lesions of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) show that periosteal thickening occurs in proximity to the tumour. We developed a genetically dissectible mouse model of HNSCC and demonstrate that inducible depletion of periosteal cells accelerates cancerous invasion of the bone. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that expression of the gene encoding the protease inhibitor TIMP1 is markedly increased in the periosteum at the pre-invasive stage. This increase is due to upregulation of HIF1α expression in the tumour microenvironment, and increased TIMP1 inactivates matrix-degrading proteases, promoting periosteal thickening to inhibit cancer invasion. Genetic deletion of Timp1 impairs periosteal expansion, exacerbating bone invasion and decreasing survival in tumour-bearing mice. Together, these data show that the periosteal reaction may act as a functional stromal barrier against tumour progression, representing a unique example of tissue immunity mediated by stromal cells. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Tissue Inhibitor Of Metalloproteinase 1; Hypoxia-inducible Factor 1, Alpha Subunit; Timp1 Protein, Human; Timp1 Protein, Mouse; Tissue Inhibitor Of Metalloproteinase-1; Confocal Laser Microscope Ax/axr; Diva Bd Biosciences V9.0; Facscanto Ii And Facsaria Iii; Flowjo Treestar V10.8.2; Graphpad Prism Software V8.4.0; Lightcycler; Lumina Series Iii; Nebnext Ultra Ii Dna Library Prep Kit; Nikon C2 Confocal Microscope; Reliaprep Rna Miniprep System; Scanxmate-a100s Scanner; Superscript Iii; Cd63 Antigen; Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1alpha; Timp1 Protein, Human; Timp1 Protein, Mouse; Tissue Inhibitor Of Metalloproteinase 1; Bone; Cancer; Cell Component; Gene Expression; Immunity; Inhibitor; Rna; Tumor; Adult; Aged; Anesthesia; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Body Mass; Bone Metabolism; Bone Metastasis; Breast Cancer; Cancer Transplantation; Computer Assisted Tomography; Controlled Study; Crispr-cas9 System; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Eo771 Cell Line; Female; Flow Cytometry; Gene Editing; Genetic Transfection; Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Histocompatibility; Human; Human Tissue; Immunohistochemistry; Infection; Light Dark Cycle; Male; Mouse; Mouth Cancer; Nonhuman; Osteoblast Cell Line; Osteoclast; Osteocyte; Periosteal Bone; Periosteum; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sanger Sequencing; Single Cell Rna Seq; Tumor Growth; Tumor Invasion; Tumor Microenvironment; Whole Exome Sequencing; Animal; Bone Tumor; Disease Model; Genetics; Head And Neck Tumor; Metabolism; Pathology; Single Cell Analysis; Stroma Cell; Animals; Bone And Bones; Bone Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Head And Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Hypoxia-inducible Factor 1, Alpha Subunit; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Periosteum; Single-cell Analysis; Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of Head And Neck; Stromal Cells; Tissue Inhibitor Of Metalloproteinase-1; Tumor Microenvironment","CD63 antigen; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; TIMP1 protein, human; Timp1 protein, mouse; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; bone; cancer; cell component; gene expression; immunity; inhibitor; RNA; tumor; adult; aged; anesthesia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body mass; bone metabolism; bone metastasis; breast cancer; cancer transplantation; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; EO771 cell line; female; flow cytometry; gene editing; genetic transfection; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; histocompatibility; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; infection; light dark cycle; male; mouse; mouth cancer; nonhuman; osteoblast cell line; osteoclast; osteocyte; periosteal bone; periosteum; real time polymerase chain reaction; Sanger sequencing; single cell RNA seq; tumor growth; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; whole exome sequencing; animal; bone tumor; disease model; genetics; head and neck tumor; metabolism; pathology; single cell analysis; stroma cell; Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Periosteum; Single-Cell Analysis; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Stromal Cells; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1; Tumor Microenvironment","","tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, 140208-24-8; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; TIMP1 protein, human; Timp1 protein, mouse; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1","Funding text 1: The authors thank T.

The Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) helps determine the leaf nutrient status of various plants worldwide. However, the DRIS-based nutritional balance in pomelo leaves remains to be established. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to (i) construct the DRIS norms and indices for nutrients, including macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) and trace elements (Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mn) in pomelo leaves, and (ii) establish nutrient sufficiency value ranges for sustainable pomelo cultivation in the VMD. We collected 270 leaf samples at three stages of pomelo growth, i.e., flowering, fruit development, and postharvest, and calculated DRIS indices for various nutrients. The DRIS indices established for various nutrients in pomelo leaves were accurate and reliable, as indicated by the high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.43–0.93, p < 0.05) between nutrient concentrations and their DRIS indices. We observed that pomelo leaves were deficient in N (IN = −6.82), P (IP = −24.0), and Fe (IFe = −0.40) at the flowering stage and most deficient in P (IP = −15.6), K (IK = −11.7), Fe (IFe = −0.50), and Mn (IMn = −2.31) at the fruit development stage. However, only N (IN = −2.64) and P (IP = −13.4) shortages were observed at the postharvest stage. Thus, in this study, we evaluated nutrient value ranges (deficient, balanced, and excess) in pomelo leaves at their different growth stages and established DRIS indices for various nutrients. The results contribute to our understanding of the nutritional status of pomelo leaves, which can help growers improve plant health for sustainable pomelo production. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ascorbic Acid; Copper; Cyanocobalamin; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Nitrogen; Phosphate; Phosphorus; Potassium; Sodium; Zinc; Soil; Trace Elements; Ascorbic Acid; Copper; Cyanocobalamin; Fertilizer; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Nitrogen; Phosphate; Phosphorus; Potassium; Sodium; Soil Organic Matter; Trace Element; Zinc; Article; Atomic Absorption Spectrometry; Betaproteobacteria; Biodegradability; Citrus; Controlled Study; Correlation Analysis; Electronic Spreadsheet; Indonesia; Leaf Area; Medicinal Plant; Nonhuman; Nutrient Content; Nutrition; Nutritional Status; Plant Leaf; Pummelo; Soil; Soil Acidity; Statistical Analysis; Student T Test; Chemistry; Fruit; Growth, Development And Aging; Nutrient; Viet Nam; Fruit; Nutrients; Plant Leaves; Soil; Trace Elements; Vietnam","ascorbic acid; copper; cyanocobalamin; fertilizer; iron; magnesium; manganese; nitrogen; phosphate; phosphorus; potassium; sodium; soil organic matter; trace element; zinc; Article; atomic absorption spectrometry; Betaproteobacteria; biodegradability; Citrus; controlled study; correlation analysis; electronic spreadsheet; Indonesia; leaf area; medicinal plant; nonhuman; nutrient content; nutrition; nutritional status; plant leaf; pummelo; soil; soil acidity; statistical analysis; Student t test; chemistry; fruit; growth, development and aging; nutrient; Viet Nam; Fruit; Nutrients; Plant Leaves; Soil; Trace Elements; Vietnam","","ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; cyanocobalamin, 53570-76-6, 68-19-9, 8064-09-3; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Soil; Trace Elements","The research was funded by the People\u2019s Committee of Hau Giang, grant number 14/H-KHCN.

The neutron tagging efficiency has been improved compared to the pure-water phase by detecting a total energy of 8 MeV gamma rays emitted by thermal neutron capture on Gd. It enables us to improve, for example, the sensitivity of diffuse supernova neutrino background, the accuracy of the reconstruction for the supernova direction, and so on. For these physics targets, accurate evaluation of neutron identification efficiency is essential.

The detector is a cylindrical tank 39.3 m in diameter and 41.4 m high, filled with about 50 kton of gadolinium loaded water. We measured 9Li isotopic nuclei produced by muon spallation using the data taken from 2020 to 2022 by the Super-Kamiokande detector with 0.011% gadolinium concentration in water. Cosmic-ray muons that penetrate the detector form hadron showers in water and secondary hadrons produce unstable radioisotopes through the spallation. Among those spallation products, 9Li is a long-lived radioactive isotope with a lifetime of about 0.26 seconds. It emits an electron and a neutron at a branching ratio of 50.8%, which is difficult to distinguish from the inverse beta decay caused by electron antineutrinos. Therefore, 9Li is one of the main background sources in the observation of diffuse supernova neutrino background. In this study, the energy spectrum of the electrons was measured with a threshold at 4.5 MeV which is lowered from the previous result with pure water. We will report the analysis method and results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cerenkov Counters; Cosmic Ray Detectors; Cosmic Ray Measurement; Electrons; Negative Ions; Neutrons; Photons; Positive Ions; Radioactivity; Spalling; Branching Ratio; Cosmic-ray Muons; Cosmogenics; Cylindrical Tanks; Gadolinia; Hadron Showers; Inverse Beta-decay; Measurements Of; Spallation Products; Water Cherenkov Detectors; Hadrons","Cerenkov counters; Cosmic ray detectors; Cosmic ray measurement; Electrons; Negative ions; Neutrons; Photons; Positive ions; Radioactivity; Spalling; Branching ratio; Cosmic-ray muons; Cosmogenics; Cylindrical tanks; Gadolinia; Hadron showers; Inverse beta-decay; Measurements of; Spallation products; Water Cherenkov detectors; Hadrons","","","","Zhang, Yang, First measurement of radioactive isotope production through cosmic-ray muon spallation in Super-Kamiokande IV, Physical Review D, 93, 1, (2016); Fukuda, Shigekazu, The Super-Kamiokande detector, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 501, 2-3, pp. 418-462, (2003); Nucl 632 Instr Meth Phys Res Sect A, (2022); Watanabe, Hiroko, First study of neutron tagging with a water Cherenkov detector, Astroparticle Physics, 31, 4, pp. 320-328, (2009); Nim A, (2003)","","Sissa Medialab Srl","et al.; Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) Univeristy of Tokyo; International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP); JPS; Nagoya Convention and Visitors Bureau; Nagoya University","38th International Cosmic Ray Conference, ICRC 2023","","Nagoya","202941","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212304728"

The searches use unbinned maximum likelihood method, and test statistics is calculated to find signal excess over atmospheric neutrino background. The time-integrated search method is updated from a previous search by adding the neutrino energy distribution in the likelihood to consider different power-law emission spectra with varying spectral indices. This is the first time to perform the time-dependent search, which has a better performance in searching for neutrino emission in a short time period, in Super-Kamiokande.

This led to a high neutron detection efficiency, which allows us to distinguish different neutrino reactions, enhance signals and remove backgrounds more efficiently. In the summer of 2022, an update of SK-Gd was done by adding additional Gd, and thus totally 39 tonnes of gadolinium sulfate octahydrate has been introduced in the water. The Gd concentration was estimated as 0.0332±0.0002% based on the dissolved weight of gadolinium sulfate octahydrate powder. It is consistent with the result of the direct sampling from the detector as 334 ± 4 ppm. The spallation neutron measurement and AmBe calibration confirms the shorter capture time constant and higher capture event rate due to the second loading. Therefore, we achieved 1.5 times higher than that of the first loaded phase as expected. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gadolinium Compounds; Neutron Detectors; Photons; Positive Ions; Detection Efficiency; Direct Sampling; Gadolinia; Neutron Detection; Neutron Measurements; Pure Water; Spallation Neutrons; Status And Prospect; Sulphates; Super-kamiokande Experiment; Neutrons","Gadolinium compounds; Neutron detectors; Photons; Positive ions; Detection efficiency; Direct sampling; Gadolinia; Neutron detection; Neutron measurements; Pure water; Spallation neutrons; Status and prospect; Sulphates; Super-Kamiokande experiment; Neutrons","","","","Fukuda, Shigekazu, The Super-Kamiokande detector, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 501, 2-3, pp. 418-462, (2003); Abe, Ko, First gadolinium loading to Super-Kamiokande, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 1027, (2022); Harada, Masayuki, Search for Astrophysical Electron Antineutrinos in Super-Kamiokande with 0.01% Gadolinium-loaded Water, Astrophysical Journal Letters, 951, 2, (2023); Abe, Ko, Diffuse supernova neutrino background search at Super-Kamiokande, Physical Review D, 104, 12, (2021); Hosokawa, Keishi, Development of ultra-pure gadolinium sulfate for the Super-Kamiokande gadolinium project, Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics, 2023, 1, (2023); Rapid Analysis of 226 Ra in Ultrapure Gadolinium Sulfate Octahydrate; Shinoki, Masataka, Measurement of the cosmogenic neutron yield in Super-Kamiokande with gadolinium loaded water, Physical Review D, 107, 9, (2023)","","Sissa Medialab Srl","et al.; Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) Univeristy of Tokyo; International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP); JPS; Nagoya Convention and Visitors Bureau; Nagoya University","38th International Cosmic Ray Conference, ICRC 2023","","Nagoya","202941","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212300824"

Here, we report the first measurement of the atmospheric neutrino-oxygen NCQE cross section in the Super-Kamiokande Gadolinium (SK-Gd) experiment using 552.2 days of full SK-VI data. The measured NCQE cross section is 0.74 ± 0.22(stat.) +<inf>−</inf>0.86<inf>0.16</inf>(syst.) × 10−38 cm2, which is consistent with the theoretical NCQE cross section and the previous study in SK within the range of the uncertainty. Furthermore, we established the verification method for nucleon-nucleus interaction models using atmospheric neutrino events. We performed the verification using the Bertini Cascade model (BERT), the Binary Cascade model (BIC) and the Liège Intranuclear Cascade model (INCL++). As a result, we suggested that BIC and INCL++ are closer to the observed data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atoms; Negative Ions; Photons; Positive Ions; Supernovae; Atmospheric Neutrinos; Binary Cascade; Cascade Modeling; Gadolinia; Intranuclear Cascade Model; Measurements Of; Neutral Currents; Quasielastic; Supernova Relic Neutrinos; Uncertainty; Neutrons","Atoms; Negative ions; Photons; Positive ions; Supernovae; Atmospheric neutrinos; Binary cascade; Cascade modeling; Gadolinia; Intranuclear cascade model; Measurements of; Neutral currents; Quasielastic; Supernova relic neutrinos; Uncertainty; Neutrons","","","","Beacom, John Francis, Antineutrino spectroscopy with large water Čerenkov detectors, Physical Review Letters, 93, 17, pp. 1-171101, (2004); Harada, Masayuki, Search for Astrophysical Electron Antineutrinos in Super-Kamiokande with 0.01% Gadolinium-loaded Water, Astrophysical Journal Letters, 951, 2, (2023); Wan, Linyan, Measurement of the neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasielastic cross section using atmospheric neutrinos at Super-Kamiokande, Physical Review D, 99, 3, (2019); Fukuda, Shigekazu, The Super-Kamiokande detector, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 501, 2-3, pp. 418-462, (2003); Honda, Morihiro, Improvement of low energy atmospheric neutrino flux calculation using the JAM nuclear interaction model, Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology, 83, 12, (2011); Richard, Euan, Measurements of the atmospheric neutrino flux by Super-Kamiokande: Energy spectra, geomagnetic effects, and solar modulation, Physical Review D, 94, 5, (2016); Hayato, Yoshinari, The NEUT neutrino interaction simulation program library, European Physical Journal: Special Topics, 230, 24, pp. 4469-4481, (2021); Ankowski, Artur M., Analysis of γ-ray production in neutral-current neutrino-oxygen interactions at energies above 200 MeV, Physical Review Letters, 108, 5, (2012); Abe, Ko, Measurement of the neutrino-oxygen neutral-current interaction cross section by observing nuclear deexcitation γ rays, Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology, 90, 7, (2014); Abe, Ko, Measurement of neutrino and antineutrino neutral-current quasielasticlike interactions on oxygen by detecting nuclear deexcitation γ rays, Physical Review D, 100, 11, (2019)","","Sissa Medialab Srl","et al.; Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) Univeristy of Tokyo; International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP); JPS; Nagoya Convention and Visitors Bureau; Nagoya University","38th International Cosmic Ray Conference, ICRC 2023","","Nagoya","202941","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212267010"

An accuracy of the absolute atmospheric neutrino flux and its flavor ratio are limited due to the uncertainty of meson productions in hadronic interaction models. In order to reduce such uncertainty, measurements of the charge ratio and the polarization of cosmic-ray muons are important as new inputs to theoretical models which simulate the atmospheric neutrino flux. In this proceedings, we present the results of the charge ratio (R) and polarization (Pμ<inf>0</inf>) of cosmic-ray muon measurements using the decay electrons collected from 2008 September to 2022 June by the Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector. We measured muon charge ratio to be R = 1.32±0.02 (stat.+syst.) and the muon polarization at the production location to be Pμ<inf>0</inf> = 0.52±0.01 (stat.+syst.). The SK detector uniquely measured the polarization of cosmic-ray muons with energies more than 1 TeV at sea-level because of its underground location. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bosons; Cosmic Ray Detectors; Cosmic Ray Measurement; Cosmology; Hadrons; Heavy Ions; Negative Ions; Neutron Flux; Photons; Positive Ions; Proportional Counters; Air Showers; Atmospheric Neutrinos; Charge Polarization; Charge Ratio; Cosmic Ray Interactions; Cosmic-ray Muons; Flavor Ratios; Measurements Of; Neutrino Fluxes; Uncertainty; Cosmic Rays","Bosons; Cosmic ray detectors; Cosmic ray measurement; Cosmology; Hadrons; Heavy ions; Negative ions; Neutron flux; Photons; Positive ions; Proportional counters; Air showers; Atmospheric neutrinos; Charge polarization; Charge ratio; Cosmic ray interactions; Cosmic-ray muons; Flavor ratios; Measurements of; Neutrino fluxes; Uncertainty; Cosmic rays","","","We gratefully acknowledge cooperation of the Kamioka Mining and Smelting Company.

The mesons such pions and kaons mostly decay into muons immediately, reflecting the details of the hadronic interactions depending on their energy and lifetime. The modulation of the cosmic-ray muon rate as well as the flux and the atmospheric kaon-to-pion production ratio are important to determine the flux and energy of the atmospheric neutrino. In particular, the kaon-to-pion production ratio r<inf>K/π</inf> is measured with the correlation coefficient α<inf>T</inf> between the cosmic-ray muon rate in the underground detector and the atmospheric temperature. As a result, we obtained the correlation coefficient r<inf>K/π</inf> = 0.85 ± 0.01 (statistical uncertainty only) and r<inf>K/π</inf> = 0.12 ± 0.03 (statistical uncertainty only) using the data taken in 10 years at the Super-Kamiokande detector.

Nevertheless, strong constraints on these properties are set by current observations, particularly for GeV to TeV WIMP-like dark matter particles. In contrast, sub-GeV dark matter scenarios are largely unexplored and still offer promising prospects for dark matter detection. In this contribution, we conduct a search for low-energy electrons scattered by boosted dark matter particles in the Super-Kamiokande detector. In particular, a two-component dark matter scenario is considered, which results in a natural boosting of the non-secluded secondary dark matter particles produced by the decay or annihilation of the dominant cold dark matter component. This work focuses on boosted dark matter from the centre of our Galaxy, with scattered electron energies ranging from a few MeV to a few hundred of MeV. We present the first sensitivities of such low-energy boosted dark matter search using Super-Kamiokande. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dark Energy; Dark Matter; Electron Energy Levels; Electron Scattering; Germanium Compounds; 'current; Cold Dark Matters; Dark Matter; Dark Matter Detection; Dark Matter Particles; Electrons Energy; Low Energy Electrons; Property; Scattered Electrons; Two-component; Electrons","Dark energy; Dark Matter; Electron energy levels; Electron scattering; Germanium compounds; 'current; Cold dark matters; Dark matter; Dark matter detection; Dark matter particles; Electrons energy; Low energy electrons; Property; Scattered electrons; Two-component; Electrons","","","","Bertone, Gianfranco, History of dark matter, Reviews of Modern Physics, 90, 4, (2018); Ade, Peter A.R., Planck 2013 results.

Machine learning can identify resistance mechanisms from DNA sequence data without prior knowledge. The first step in building a machine learning model is a feature extraction from sequencing data. Traditional methods like single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and k-mer counting yield numerous, often redundant features, complicating prediction and analysis. In this paper, we propose PanKA, a method using the pangenome to extract a concise set of relevant features for predicting AMR. PanKA not only enables fast model training and prediction but also improves accuracy. Applied to the Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial species, our model is more accurate than conventional and state-of-the-art methods in predicting AMR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacteriology; Genomics; Machine Learning","","","","This work has been supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) in project code VINIF.2019.DA11.

Most of the time, air quality data are time series data. However, due to various reasons, we often encounter missing values in datasets collected during data preparation and aggregation steps. The inability to analyze and handle missing data will significantly hinder the data analysis process. To address this issue, this paper offers an extensive review of air quality prediction and missing data imputation techniques for time series, particularly in relation to environmental challenges. In addition, we empirically assess eight imputation methods, including mean, median, kNNI, MICE, SAITS, BRITS, MRNN, and Transformer, to scrutinize their impact on air quality data. The evaluation is conducted using diverse air quality datasets gathered from numerous cities globally. Based on these evaluations, we offer practical recommendations for practitioners dealing with missing data in time series scenarios for environmental data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Monoxide; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Sulfur Dioxide; Air Pollutants; Intel Xeon Gold 6254 Cpu; Carbon Monoxide; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Sulfur Dioxide; Air Monitoring; Air Pollution; Air Quality; Article; Convolutional Neural Network; Data Analysis; Data Imputation; Deep Learning; Feature Extraction; Health Hazard; Information Processing; K Nearest Neighbor; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Mathematical Phenomena; Multilayer Perceptron; Particulate Matter; Particulate Matter 10; Particulate Matter 2.5; Prediction; Principal Component Analysis; Random Forest; Recurrent Neural Network; Social Network; Statistical Analysis; Support Vector Machine; Wind Speed; Air Pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Human; Procedures; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans","carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; convolutional neural network; data analysis; data imputation; deep learning; feature extraction; health hazard; information processing; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical phenomena; multilayer perceptron; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; principal component analysis; random forest; recurrent neural network; social network; statistical analysis; support vector machine; wind speed; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans","","carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; ozone, 10028-15-6; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5; Air Pollutants","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DS2023-18-01.

In Japan, government and commercial stakeholders are promulgating emotional AI not only as a neoliberal, cost-saving benefit but also as a heuristic that can improve the learning experience at home and in the classroom. Nevertheless, critics warn of a myriad of risks and harms posed by the technology such as privacy violation, unresolved deeper cultural and systemic issues, machinic parentalism as well as the danger of imposing attitudinal conformity. This study brings together the Technological Acceptance Model and Moral Foundation Theory to examine the cultural construal of risks and rewards regarding the application of emotional AI technologies. It explores Japanese citizens’ perceptions of emotional AI in education and children's toys via analysis of a final sample of 2000 Japanese respondents with five age groups (20s–60s) and two sexes equally represented. The linear regression models for determinants of attitude toward emotional AI in education and in toys account for 44 % and 38 % variation in the data, respectively. The analyses reveal a significant negative correlation between attitudes toward emotional AI in both schools and toys and concerns about privacy violations or the dystopian nature of constantly monitoring of children and students’ emotions with AI (Education: β<inf>DystopianConcern</inf> = − .094***; Toys: β<inf>PrivacyConcern</inf> = − .199***). However, worries about autonomy and bias show mixed results, which hints at certain cultural nuances of values in a Japanese context and how new the technologies are. Concurring with the empirical literature on the Moral Foundation Theory, the chi-square (Χ2) test shows Japanese female respondents express more fear regarding the potential harms of emotional AI technologies for the youth's privacy, autonomy, data misuse, and fairness (p < 0.001). The policy implications of these results and insights on the impacts of emotional AI for the future of human-machine interaction are also provided. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Edtech; Emotional Ai; Moral Foundation Theory; Smart Toys; Technological Acceptance Model","","","","","Ko, Hyunwoong, Changes in computer-analyzed facial expressions with age, Sensors, 21, 14, (2021); Affective Computing, (1997); Ho, Manhtung, Affective computing scholarship and the rise of China: a view from 25 years of bibliometric data, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 8, 1, (2021); undefined, (2021); undefined, (2023); Podoletz, Lena, We have to talk about emotional AI and crime, AI and Society, 38, 3, pp. 1067-1082, (2023); Technol Soc, (2022); Emotional AI the Rise of Empathic Media, (2018); Kim, Jung-yong, Identification of video game addiction using heart-rate variability parameters, Sensors, 21, 14, (2021); McStay, Andrew, In cars (are we really safest of all?): interior sensing and emotional opacity, International Review of Law, Computers and Technology, 36, 3, pp. 470-493, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","24058440","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201489535"

However, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the system have remained unclear. This study aimed to examine methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) emissions from the system, including (i) land-based versus high-density polyethylene-lined (HDPE) nursery ponds and (ii) conventional versus improved grow-out ponds inoculated with effective microorganisms (EM) bioproducts. The results showed that CH<inf>4</inf> flux in land-based and HDPE-lined nursery ponds were 1.04 and 0.25 mgCH<inf>4</inf> m−2 h−1, respectively, while the N<inf>2</inf>O flux was 8.37 and 6.62 μgN<inf>2</inf>O m−2 h−1, respectively. Global warming potential (GWP) from land-based nursery ponds (18.3 g CO<inf>2eq</inf> m−2) was approximately 3 folds higher than that of the HDPE-lined nursery pond (6.1 g CO<inf>2eq</inf> m−2). Similarly, the mean CH<inf>4</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O fluxes were 15.84 mg CH<inf>4</inf> m−2 h−1 and 7.17 μg N<inf>2</inf>O m−2 h−1 for the conventional ponds, and 10.51 mg CH<inf>4</inf> m−2 h−1 and 7.72 μg N<inf>2</inf>O m−2 h−1 for the improved grow-out ponds. Conventional practices (2388 g CO<inf>2eq</inf> m−2) had a higher 1.5-fold GWP compared to the improved grow-out pond (1635 g CO<inf>2eq</inf> m−2). The continuation of the land-based nursery pond and conventional aquacultural farming practices increase CH<inf>4</inf> emission and GWP, while applying HDPE-lined nursery ponds combined with improved grow-out ponds could be a promising approach for reducing GHG emissions in rice-shrimp rotation systems. This study recommends further works in the rice-shrimp rotation systems, including (i) an examination of the effects of remaining rice stubbles in the platform on the availability of TOC levels and GHG emissions and (ii) ameliorating dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on the effectiveness of GHG emission reduction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Methane Emission; Nitrous Oxide Emission; Rice-shrimp Rotation Systems; Vietnamese Mekong Delta","","","","Shrimp and mud crab seeds are provided by local hatcheries, which are under strict quality control. Typically, the seed is directly stocked in their grow-out ponds. For each aquacultural crop, stocking can be executed from 2 to 3 times for shrimp and 1\u20132 times for crab. Harvest is ordinarily carried out using local net traps after stocking for around three months and prolonged till August [6]. The farmed practice has applied no commercial aquaculture feeds that utilise nature-based sources and the balance of its aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, the model is currently receiving much more attention for its adaptability and sustainability. However, direct stocking can cause unpredictable shrimp-cultured risks, so shrimp productivity gained is lower than expected yields [9]. Since 2021, World Wide Fund for Nature in Vietnam (WWF-VN) has rolled out better solutions for reducing environmental risks and expecting higher shrimp productivity throughout the promotion of a 20-day stage in nursery ponds prior to stocking into the grow-out pond. In addition, the suggestion includes (i) the application of co-incubation of effective microorganism (EM) bioproducts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae (109 CFU kg\u22121), Bacillus licheniformis (109 CFU kg\u22121), Bacillus subtillis (109 CFU kg\u22121), enzyme amylase, protease, lipase, and necessary nutrients) with molasses and rice bran powder (co-incubated inoculum); and (ii) crushed-boiled fish as an organic feed source for shrimp [10]. The improved model is currently employed as pilot scales at various local farms in Bac Lieu province.This study was financially supported by the Worldwide Fund for Nature, a representative office in Ha Noi - Vietnam (WWF-VN) (Project code: 40002332/403363/112000; Agreement No. FY23-1245-MD).

Prompt diagnosis and effective management are imperative for better outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we explore the potential of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as a promising tool for early sepsis detection and prognosis assessment, aiming to address limitations associated with traditional diagnostic methods. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we collected relevant literature from thirteen databases. Studies were included if they analyzed quantitative diagnostic or prognostic cfDNA levels in humans in case of sepsis. We collected data on basic study characteristics, baseline patient demographics (e.g. age and sex), and cfDNA levels across different stages of sepsis. Pooled SMD with 95%-CI was calculated, and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software facilitated meta-analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess cfDNA's combined sensitivity and specificity in diagnostics and prognostics. Results We included a final of 44 studies, of which, only 32 with 2950 participants were included in the meta-analysis. cfDNA levels were higher in septic patients compared to healthy controls (SMD = 3.303; 95%-CI [2.461-4.145], p<0.01). Furthermore, cfDNA levels were higher in non-survivors than survivors (SMD = 1.554; 95%-CI [0.905-2.202], p<0.01). Prognostic studies demonstrated a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.78, while diagnostic studies showed a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.87. Conclusion These findings show that cfDNA levels are significantly higher in sepsis patients compared to control groups and non-survivors in comparison to survivors among both adult and pediatric populations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomarkers; Cell-free Nucleic Acids; Biostat Version 3.3.07; Biological Marker; Circulating Free Dna; Cell Free Nucleic Acid; Area Under The Curve; Article; Bacteremia; Clinical Outcome; Data Quality Assessment; Demographics; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Early Diagnosis; Human; Intensive Care Unit; Length Of Stay; Meta Analysis; Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews And Meta-analyses; Qualitative Analysis; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Sensitivity And Specificity; Sepsis; Systematic Review; Blood; Diagnosis; Prognosis; Bacteremia; Biomarkers; Cell-free Nucleic Acids; Humans; Prognosis; Roc Curve; Sepsis","biological marker; circulating free DNA; cell free nucleic acid; area under the curve; Article; bacteremia; clinical outcome; data quality assessment; demographics; diagnostic test accuracy study; early diagnosis; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; meta analysis; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; qualitative analysis; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sepsis; systematic review; blood; diagnosis; prognosis; Bacteremia; Biomarkers; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; Humans; Prognosis; ROC Curve; Sepsis","","Biomarkers; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids","","Christaki, Eirini, The complex pathogenesis of bacteremia: From antimicrobial clearance mechanisms to the genetic background of the host, Virulence, 5, 1, pp. 57-65, (2014); Cantor, Richard M., Bacteremia and bacterial sepsis: The patient with a positive blood culture, pp. 309-313, (2019); Singer, Mervyn, The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3), JAMA, 315, 8, pp. 801-810, (2016); Rudd, Kristina E., Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990–2017: analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study, The Lancet, 395, 10219, pp. 200-211, (2020); Dombrovskiy, Viktor Y., Rapid increase in hospitalization and mortality rates for severe sepsis in the United States: A trend analysis from 1993 to 2003, Critical Care Medicine, 35, 5, pp. 1244-1250, (2007); Rhee, Chanu, Sepsis trends: Increasing incidence and decreasing mortality, or changing denominator?, Journal of Thoracic Disease, 2, pp. S89-S100, (2020); Rubens, Muni B., Increasing Sepsis Rates in the United States: Results From National Inpatient Sample, 2005 to 2014, Journal of Intensive Care Medicine, 35, 9, pp. 858-868, (2020); Alberti, Corinne, Epidemiology of sepsis and infection in ICU patients from an international multicentre cohort study, Intensive Care Medicine, 28, 2, pp. 108-121, (2002); Sakr, Yasser L., Sepsis in intensive care unit patients: Worldwide data from the intensive care over nations audit, Open Forum Infectious Diseases, 5, 12, (2018); Vincent, Jean Louis, Sepsis in European intensive care units: Results of the SOAP study, Critical Care Medicine, 34, 2, pp. 344-353, (2006)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","39208340","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202746901"

Using state-of-the-art epidemiological and climatological datasets, we examined the association between multiple heat stress indicators (HSIs) and daily human mortality in 739 cities worldwide. Notable differences were observed in the long-term trends and timing of heat events detected by HSIs. Air temperature (T<inf>air</inf>) predicts heat-related mortality well in cities with a robust negative T<inf>air</inf>-relative humidity correlation (C<inf>T-RH</inf>). However, in cities with near-zero or weak positive C<inf>T-RH</inf>, HSIs considering humidity provide enhanced predictive power compared to T<inf>air</inf>. Furthermore, the magnitude and timing of heat-related mortality measured by HSIs could differ largely from those associated with T<inf>air</inf> in many cities. Our findings provide important insights into specific regions where humans are vulnerable to humid heat and can facilitate the further enhancement of heat-health alert systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Heat Stress; Humidity; Mortality; Urban Climate","","","","Q.G., M.H., and T.O. were supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF23S21120) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency provided by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan.

The result shows that high adsorption energies for indole are obtained at the deprotonated μ<inf>3</inf>-O, followed by unsaturated Zr-cation sites in defective UiO-66 structures. The key interactions are the hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen donor NH group of indole with the negative charge oxygen atom of the induced μ<inf>3</inf>-O site and the dative covalent bond between the nitrogen atom of indole with the unsaturated Zr-cation. For hydrogen bonding, the binding energies tend to increase with the increasing of defect concentrations and spread a broad range up to ≈−2.00 eV. It is also shown that the vibrational modes of indole molecules are influenced by their adsorption sites. Accordingly, the NH stretching modes of the adsorbed indole are redshifted ≈100–300 cm−1 compared to its counterpart in the isolated indole. The strongest redshift is obtained for indole adsorbed at the μ<inf>3</inf>-O site with three missing linkers. The occupation of water at the active sites may enhance or diminish the adsorption affinity of indole relying on the hydrogen bonding mechanism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Defective Uio-66; First-principles; Hydrogen Bonding; Indole; Missing-linker; Adsorption; Binding Energy; Defect Engineering; Hydrogen; Organometallics; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Positive Ions; Adsorption Affinity; Adsorption Energies; Adsorption Site; Defective Uio-66; First Principles; First-principle Study; Indole; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Missing-linker; Hydrogen Bonds","Adsorption; Binding energy; Defect engineering; Hydrogen; Organometallics; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Positive ions; Adsorption affinity; Adsorption energies; Adsorption site; Defective UiO-66; First principles; First-principle study; Indole; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Missing-linker; Hydrogen bonds","","","This research was funded by the Center for Innovative Materials and Architectures, the Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City under grant number TX2024\u201050\u201001.

Through Bayesian logistic models compiled from 40 years of data and built from 684 planted mangrove stands worldwide, we found that biomass C stock culminated at 71 to 73% to that of intact stands ∼20 years after planting. Furthermore, prioritizing mixed-species planting including Rhizophora spp. would maximize C accumulation within the biomass compared to monospecific planting. Despite a 25% increase in the first 5 years following planting, no notable change was observed in the soil C stocks thereafter, which remains at a constant value of 75% to that of intact soil C stock, suggesting that planting effectively prevents further C losses due to land use change. These results have strong implications for mangrove restoration planning and serve as a baseline for future C buildup assessments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Carbon; Soil; C (programming Language); Carbon; Bayesian; Carbon Stocks; Constant Values; Landuse Change; Logistics Model; Mixed Species; Plantings; Restoration Planning; Time Frame; Land Use; Carbon; Bayes Theorem; Biomass; Chemistry; Ecosystem; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Rhizophoraceae; Soil; Wetland; Bayes Theorem; Biomass; Ecosystem; Soil; Wetlands","C (programming language); Carbon; Bayesian; Carbon stocks; Constant values; Landuse change; Logistics model; Mixed species; Plantings; Restoration planning; Time frame; Land use; carbon; Bayes theorem; biomass; chemistry; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Rhizophoraceae; soil; wetland; Bayes Theorem; Biomass; Ecosystem; Soil; Wetlands","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Soil","Funding text 1: We would like to express our gratitude to the three anonymous reviewers whose insightful feedback and constructive suggestions significantly contributed to the enhancement of our manuscript.

These neurons coexpress several neurotransmitters and act as glutamatergic neurons. The contribution of glutamate from MCH neurons to memory- and metabolism-related functions has not been fully investigated. In a mouse model, we conditionally knocked out Slc17a6 gene, which encodes for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2), in the MCH neurons exclusively by using two different methods: the Cre recombinase/loxP system and in vivo genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9. Then, we evaluated several aspects of memory and measured metabolic rates using indirect calorimetry. We found that mice with MCH neuron-exclusive vGlut2 ablation had higher discrimination ratios between novel and familiar stimuli for novel object recognition, object location, and three-chamber tests. In contrast, there was no significant change in body weight, food intake, oxygen consumption, respiratory quotient, or locomotor activity. These findings suggest that glutamatergic signaling from MCH neurons is required to regulate memory, but its role in regulating metabolic rate is negligible. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glutamate; Melanin-concentrating Hormone (mch); Memory; Metabolic Regulation; Vglut2","","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (IS23078) and the Chinese Institute for Brain Science, Beijing (CIBR) internal funding to A.Y.

We assessed the prevalence of toxoplasmosis and its associated risk factors in PLWH in the Asia-Pacific region using data from the TREAT Asia Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Observational Database (TAHOD) of the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) Asia-Pacific. Methods This study included both retrospective and prospective cases of toxoplasmosis reported between 1997 and 2020. A matched case-control method was employed, where PLWH diagnosed with toxoplasmosis (cases) were each matched to two PLWH without a toxoplasmosis diagnosis (controls) from the same site. Sites without toxoplasmosis were excluded. Risk factors for toxoplasmosis were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Results A total of 269/9576 (2.8%) PLWH were diagnosed with toxoplasmosis in 19 TAHOD sites. Of these, 227 (84%) were reported retrospectively and 42 (16%) were prospective diagnoses after cohort enrollment. At the time of toxoplasmosis diagnosis, the median age was 33 years (interquartile range 28–38), and 80% participants were male, 75% were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Excluding 63 out of 269 people without CD4 values, 192 (93.2%) had CD4 ≤200 cells/μL and 162 (78.6%) had CD4 ≤100 cells/μL. By employing 538 matched controls, we found that factors associated with toxoplasmosis included abstaining from ART (odds ratio [OR] 3.62, 95% CI 1.81–7.24), in comparison to receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, HIV exposure through injection drug use (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.15–4.47) as opposed to engaging in heterosexual intercourse and testing positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.41–7.21). Toxoplasmosis was less likely with increasing CD4 counts (51–100 cells/μL: OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18–0.96; 101–200 cells/μL: OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06–0.34; >200 cells/μL: OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.01–0.06), when compared to CD4 ≤50 cells/μL. Moreover, the use of prophylactic cotrimoxazole was not associated with toxoplasmosis. Conclusions Symptomatic toxoplasmosis is rare but still occurs in PLWH in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in the context of delayed diagnosis, causing advanced HIV disease.

Alpha- and gamma-mangostins (AM and GM) were previously reported as potential 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and Angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2)-binding inhibitors in silico. Objective: We aimed to evaluate two active compounds, AM and GM, from Garcinia mangostana for their antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in live virus culture systems and their cytotoxicities using standard methods. Also, we aimed to prove whether 3CLpro and ACE2 neutralization were major targets and explored whether any additional targets existed. Methods: We tested the translation and replication efficiencies of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of AM and GM. Initial and subgenomic translations were evaluated by immunofluorescence of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and N expressions at 16 h after infection. The viral genome was quantified and compared with the untreated group. We also evaluated the efficacies and cytotoxicities of AM and GM against four strains of SARS-CoV-2 (wild-type B, B.1.167.2, B.1.36.16, and B.1.1.529) in Vero E6 cells. The potential targets were evaluated using cell-based anti-attachment, time-of-drug addition, in vitro 3CLpro activities, and ACE2-binding using a surrogated viral neutralization test (sVNT). Moreover, additional targets were explored using combinatorial network-based interactions and Chemical Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA). Results: AM and GM reduced SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and N expressions, suggesting that initial and subgenomic translations were globally inhibited. AM and GM inhibited all strains of SARS-CoV-2 at EC<inf>50</inf> of 0.70–3.05 μM, in which wild-type B was the most susceptible strain (EC<inf>50</inf> 0.70–0.79 μM). AM was slightly more efficient in the variants (EC<inf>50</inf> 0.88–2.41 μM), resulting in higher selectivity indices (SI 3.65–10.05), compared to the GM (EC<inf>50</inf> 0.94–3.05 μM, SI 1.66–5.40). GM appeared to be more toxic than AM in both Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. Cell-based anti-attachment and time-of-addition suggested that the potential molecular target could be at the post-infection. 3CLpro activity and ACE2 binding were interfered with in a dose-dependent manner but were insufficient to be a major target. Combinatorial network-based interaction and chemical similarity ensemble approach (SEA) suggested that fatty acid synthase (FASN), which was critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication, could be a target of AM and GM. Conclusion: AM and GM inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with the highest potency at the wild-type B and the lowest at the B.1.1.529. Multiple targets were expected to integratively inhibit viral replication in cell-based system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3c-like Protease; Alpha Mangostin; Antiviral Drug Discovery; Covid-19 Drug; Gamma Mangostin; Sars-cov-2 Drugs; Target Identification","","","","The project was supported by the National Research Council of Thailand.

However, human interventions (e.g., dam construction and sand mining) have significantly affected this basin's sediment budget and morphological alterations over recent decades. Such humane actions drive an imbalance in water resources in the basin from upstream to downstream. Therefore, this study investigated spatiotemporal changes in sediment budget and morphology alterations using long-term data and bathymetric surveys; from these data, dams and sand mining contributions were quantified and differentiated. Based on field survey data and interviews, we estimated the sand-mining volume by incorporating reported and a newly proposed empirical formula. The results show that the total riverbed incision volume from 2010 to 2021 was 63.30 Mm3, with an incision rate of 0.14 m/yr. The officially reported sand-mining rate was 1.12 Mm3/yr, while the newly proposed empirical formula estimated 4.4 Mm3/yr. According to the developed empirical formula, the percentage reductions in the sediment budget due to sand mining and upstream dams were 69.7 % and 30.3 %, respectively, according to reports, and 17.8 % and 82.2 %. The statistical method was thus likely too conservative compared to the developed empirical formula. We found that the natural sediment supplies sourced from upstream were insufficient to compensate for the mined bed material. Therefore, our combination of different datasets permitted the assessment of future geomorphological developments within the VGTB River basin under the ongoing sediment deficits. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the impacts of human interventions, specifically sand mining, on the sediment budget, morphological alterations, and riverbed incision. The developed assessment forms the foundation for developing and expanding the region's water/sediment resource management strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dam Construction; Morphological Alterations; Newly Proposed Empirical Formula; Sand Mining; Sediment Budget; Vu Gia Thu Bon River Basin","","","","This work was funded by APN \u201CAsia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research\u201D under project reference number CRRP2020-09MYKantoush (Funder ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/100005536), Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), Research Unit for Realization of Sustainable Society (RURSS) at Kyoto University, JSPS Core-to-Core Program (Grant Number: JPJSCCB20220004), and JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships Program (Fellowship ID: P24064).","Keesstra, Saskia D., Assessing riparian zone impacts on water and sediment movement: A new approach, Geologie en Mijnbouw/Netherlands Journal of Geosciences, 91, 1-2, pp. 245-255, (2012); Syvitski, James P.M., Sinking deltas due to human activities, Nature Geoscience, 2, 10, pp. 681-686, (2009); Best, Jim L., Anthropogenic stresses on the world’s big rivers, Nature Geoscience, 12, 1, pp. 7-21, (2019); Binh, Doan Van, Effects of riverbed incision on the hydrology of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Hydrological Processes, 35, 2, (2021); Boix-Fayos, Carolina, Effects of check dams, reforestation and land-use changes on river channel morphology: Case study of the Rogativa catchment (Murcia, Spain), Geomorphology, 91, 1-2, pp. 103-123, (2007); Gomez, Basil, Simulating changes to the sediment transport regime of the Waipaoa River, New Zealand, driven by climate change in the twenty-first century, Global and Planetary Change, 67, 3-4, pp. 153-166, (2009); Earth S Future, (2014); Kondolf, George Mathias, Changing sediment budget of the Mekong: Cumulative threats and management strategies for a large river basin, Science of the Total Environment, 625, pp. 114-134, (2018); Kondolf, George Mathias, The reclamation concept in regulation of gravel mining in california, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 36, 3, pp. 395-406, (1993); Ghosh, Prasanta Kumar, Sand quarrying activities in an alluvial reach of Damodar River, Eastern India: towards a geomorphic assessment, International Journal of River Basin Management, 14, 4, pp. 477-489, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","24058440","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194480619"

In Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), groups speaking these languages are concentrated in the highlands of Vietnam. However, our knowledge of the spread of AN-speaking populations in MSEA remains limited; in particular, it is not clear if AN languages were spread by demic or cultural diffusion. In this study, we present and analyze new data consisting of complete mitogenomes from 369 individuals and 847 Y-chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 170 individuals from all five Vietnamese Austronesian groups (VN-AN) and five neighboring Vietnamese Austroasiatic groups (VN-AA). We found genetic signals consistent with matrilocality in some, but not all, of the VN-AN groups. Population affinity analyses indicated connections between the AN-speaking Giarai and certain Taiwanese AN groups (Rukai, Paiwan, and Bunun). However, overall, there were closer genetic affinities between VN-AN groups and neighboring VN-AA groups, suggesting language shifts. Our study provides insights into the genetic structure of AN-speaking communities in MSEA, characterized by some contact with Taiwan and language shift in neighboring groups, indicating that the expansion of AN speakers in MSEA was a combination of cultural and demic diffusion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Mitochondrial; Article; Controlled Study; Cultural Anthropology; Diffusion; Epidemiology; Gene Structure; Male; Pacific Islands; Sex; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Southeast Asia; Speech; Taiwan; Taiwanese; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Female; Genetics; Human; Language; Population Genetics; Sexism; Y Chromosome; Mitochondrial Dna; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Dna, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Language; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sexism; Vietnam","article; controlled study; cultural anthropology; diffusion; epidemiology; gene structure; male; Pacific islands; sex; single nucleotide polymorphism; Southeast Asia; speech; Taiwan; Taiwanese; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; female; genetics; human; language; population genetics; sexism; Y chromosome; mitochondrial DNA; Chromosomes, Human, Y; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Language; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sexism; Vietnam","","DNA, Mitochondrial","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Vietnam (TL.CN.60/ 19).

To overcome this, we developed a flexible model for estimating upper limit populations and exemplified it by studying a group-living synanthrope, the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). Habitat preference maps, based on environmental and GPS data, were generated with a maximum entropy model and combined with data obtained from camera traps, line transect distance sampling, and direct sightings to produce an expected number of individuals. The mapping between habitat preference and number of individuals was optimized through a tunable parameter ρ (inquisitiveness) that accounts for repeated observations of individuals. Benchmarking against published data highlights the high accuracy of the model. Overall, this approach combines citizen science with scientific observations and reveals the long-tailed macaque populations to be (up to 80%) smaller than expected. The model's flexibility makes it suitable for many species, providing a scalable, noninvasive tool for wildlife conservation.

This prospective trial in seven high tuberculosis burden countries evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the point-of-care urine-based lipoarabinomannan assay FUJIFILM SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) among inpatients and outpatients living with HIV. Diagnostic performance of FujiLAM was assessed against a mycobacterial reference standard (sputum culture, blood culture, and Xpert Ultra from urine and sputum at enrollment, and additional sputum culture ≤7 days from enrollment), an extended mycobacterial reference standard (eMRS), and a composite reference standard including clinical evaluation. Of 1637 participants considered for the analysis, 296 (18%) were tuberculosis positive by eMRS. Median age was 40 years, median CD4 cell count was 369 cells/ul, and 52% were female. Overall FujiLAM sensitivity was 54∙4% (95% CI: 48∙7–60∙0), overall specificity was 85∙2% (83∙2–87∙0) against eMRS. Sensitivity and specificity estimates varied between sites, ranging from 26∙5% (95% CI: 17∙4%–38∙0%) to 73∙2% (60∙4%–83∙0%), and 75∙0 (65∙0%–82∙9%) to 96∙5 (92∙1%–98∙5%), respectively. Post-hoc exploratory analysis identified significant variability in the performance of the six FujiLAM lots used in this study. Lot variability limited interpretation of FujiLAM test performance. Although results with the current version of FujiLAM are too variable for clinical decision-making, the lipoarabinomannan biomarker still holds promise for tuberculosis diagnostics.

We examine how the experience of emotions like anger and disgust relate to the judged appropriateness of sanctions, in a pre-registered analysis of data from a large-scale study in 56 societies. Across the world, we find that individuals who experience anger and disgust over a norm violation are more likely to endorse confrontation, ostracism and, to a smaller extent, gossip. Moreover, we find that the experience of anger is consistently the strongest predictor of judgments of confrontation, compared to other emotions. Although the link between state-based emotions and judgments may seem universal, its strength varies across countries. Aligned with theoretical predictions, this link is stronger in societies, and among individuals, that place higher value on individual autonomy. Thus, autonomy values may increase the role that emotions play in guiding judgments of social sanctions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anger; Article; Controlled Study; Cultural Anthropology; Decision Making; Disgust; Emotion; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Ostracism; Prediction; Social Norm","anger; article; controlled study; cultural anthropology; decision making; disgust; emotion; human; major clinical study; male; ostracism; prediction; social norm","","","This research was funded by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond) [P17-0030:1].

This study aimed to evaluate the level of anxiety and its associated factors among non-Japanese residents residing in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A web-based survey in 13 languages was conducted among non-Japanese residents living in Japan during the COVID-19 situation. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory assessed the level of anxiety–State (STAI-S) scores prorated from its six-item version. The multivariable logistic regression using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) method was performed to identify the associated factors of anxiety among participants. Results From January to March 2021, we collected 392 responses. A total of 357 valid responses were analyzed. 54.6% of participants suffered from clinically significant anxiety (CSA). In multivariable logistic model analysis, the CSA status or the high level of anxiety was associated with three factors, including having troubles/difficulties in learning or working, decreased sleep duration, and decreased overall physical health (p<0.05). Conclusion Our study suggests several possible risk factors of anxiety among non-Japanese residents living in Japan undergoing the COVID-19 pandemic, including the troubles or difficulties in learning or working, the decrease in sleep duration, and the decrease in overall physical health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","R Statistical Software Version 3.6.3 For Windows; Adult; Akaike Information Criterion; Anxiety; Article; Assessment Of Humans; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Emotion; Fear; Female; Health; Human; Human Experiment; Japan; Learning; Likert Scale; Male; Mental Health; Non Japanese People; Pandemic; Population Group; Questionnaire; Resident; Risk Factor; Sleep Time; Social Media; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; Working Time; Depression; Anxiety; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Risk Factors","adult; akaike information criterion; anxiety; Article; assessment of humans; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; emotion; fear; female; health; human; human experiment; Japan; learning; Likert scale; male; mental health; non japanese people; pandemic; population group; questionnaire; resident; risk factor; sleep time; social media; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; working time; depression; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Risk Factors","","","This work was supported by the dormant deposits of Japan Network for Public Interest Activities (JANPIA), Japan.

In general, the CS is determined using laboratory tests, however, laboratory tests are time-consuming and high-cost. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate and estimate the CS using different methods, for example, machine learning techniques. This study employed Gradient Boosting (GB) to evaluate and predict the CS of hollow masonry prism. The database consists of 102 hollow concrete specimens taken from different previous published literature used for modeling. The output is the CS of the hollow masonry prism, while the inputs include the compressive strength of mortar (f<inf>m</inf>), the compressive strength of blocks (f<inf>b</inf>), height-to-thickness ratio (h/t), the ratio of f<inf>m</inf>/f<inf>b</inf>. To reduce the overfitting problem, this study used K-Fold cross-validation, then particle swarm optimization (PSO) was employed to obtain the optimum hyperparameter. The GB model then was modeled using the optimum hyperparameters. The results showed that the GB model performed very well in evaluating and predicting the CS of the hollow masonry prims with a high prediction accuracy, the values of R2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are 0.977, 0.803 MPa, 0.612 MPa, and 0.036%, respectively. The performance of the GB model in this study outperformed in comparison to six different machine learning models (decision tree, linear regression, random forest regression, ridge regression, Artificial Neural network, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) used in previous studies. The results of sensitivity analysis using SHAP and PDP-2D indicate that the CS is strongly dependent on the f<inf>b</inf> (with a mean SHAP value of 3.2), h/t (with a mean SHAP value of 1.63), while the f<inf>m</inf>/f<inf>b</inf> (with a mean SHAP value of 0.57) had a small effect on the CS. Thus, it can be stated that this research provides a good method to evaluate and predict the CS of the hollow masonry prism, which can bring good knowledge for practical application in this field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concrete; Epoxy Resin; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Clinical Evaluation; Comparative Study; Compressive Strength; Decision Tree; Diagnostic Accuracy; Feature Extraction; Finite Element Analysis; Fuzzy System; Human; K Fold Cross Validation; K Nearest Neighbor; Learning Algorithm; Linear Regression Analysis; Machine Learning; Mathematical Analysis; Particle Swarm Optimization; Quantitative Structure Activity Relation; Random Forest; Regression Analysis; Response Surface Method; Root Mean Squared Error; Sensitivity Analysis; Thickness; Three-dimensional Imaging; Validation Process; Factual Database; Knowledge; Algorithms; Compressive Strength; Databases, Factual; Knowledge; Neural Networks, Computer","concrete; epoxy resin; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; clinical evaluation; comparative study; compressive strength; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; feature extraction; finite element analysis; fuzzy system; human; k fold cross validation; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; linear regression analysis; machine learning; mathematical analysis; particle swarm optimization; quantitative structure activity relation; random forest; regression analysis; response surface method; root mean squared error; sensitivity analysis; thickness; three-dimensional imaging; validation process; factual database; knowledge; Algorithms; Compressive Strength; Databases, Factual; Knowledge; Neural Networks, Computer","","","","Lourenço, Paulo B., Validation of analytical and continuum numerical methods for estimating the compressive strength of masonry, Computers and Structures, 84, 29-30, pp. 1977-1989, (2006); Mohamad, Gihad, Mechanics of hollow concrete block masonry prisms under compression: Review and prospects, Cement and Concrete Composites, 29, 3, pp. 181-192, (2007); Barbosa, Cláudius S., On the compressive strength prediction for concrete masonry prisms, Materials and Structures/Materiaux et Constructions, 43, 3, pp. 331-344, (2010); Köksal, Hasan Orhun, Compression behavior and failure mechanisms of concrete masonry prisms, Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 17, 1, pp. 107-115, (2005); Chalabi, Romina, Nonmodel rapid seismic assessment of eccentrically braced frames incorporating masonry infills using machine learning techniques, Journal of Building Engineering, 79, (2023); Jahangir, Hashem, Bond Behavior Investigation Between Steel Reinforced Grout Composites and Masonry Substrate, Iranian Journal of Science and Technology - Transactions of Civil Engineering, 46, 5, pp. 3519-3535, (2022); Tripura, Deb Dulal, Axial load behavior of unreinforced and reinforced hollow interlocking compressed stabilized earth block masonry walls, Construction and Building Materials, 407, (2023); Deformation Failure Theory for Stack Bond Brick Masonry Prisms in Compression, (1985); Proc Br Ceram Soc, (1973); Designing Engineering and Constructing with Masonry Products, (1969)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","38442109","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187189397"

However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. Here, we tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task. Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions’ effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior—several interventions even reduced tree planting. Last, the effects of each intervention differed depending on people’s initial climate beliefs. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences and target behaviors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Research; Information Analysis; Information Dissemination; Reforestation; Behavioral Science; Behaviour Changes; Behavioural Tasks; Climate Mitigations; Global Behaviors; Information Sharing; Intervention Effectiveness; Most Likely; Policy Support; Tree Plantings; Climate Change; Behavior; Behavioral Science; Climate Change; Human; Policy; Behavioral Sciences; Climate Change; Humans; Intention; Policy","Behavioral research; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Reforestation; Behavioral science; Behaviour changes; Behavioural tasks; Climate mitigations; Global behaviors; Information sharing; Intervention effectiveness; Most likely; Policy support; Tree plantings; Climate change; behavior; behavioral science; climate change; human; policy; Behavioral Sciences; Climate Change; Humans; Intention; Policy","","","Funding: this work was supported by Google Jigsaw grant (to M.Vl., K.c.d., and J.J.V.B.), Swiss national Science Foundation P400PS_190997 (to K.c.d.), dutch Research council grant 7934 (to K.l.v.d.B.), european Union grant no. id 776608 (to K.l.v.d.B.), John templeton Foundation grant 61378 (to M.A.), the national council for Scientific and technological development grant (to A.A.), christ church college Research centre grant (to M.A.J.A.), david Phillips Fellowship grant BB/R010668/2 (to M.A.J.A.), Jacobs Foundation Fellowship (to M.A.J.A.), dFG grant project no. 390683824 (to M.A.d., P.Ba., and B.B.), nYUAd research funds (to J.J.B.), the Swiss Federal Office of energy through the energy, economy, and Society program grant number: Si/502093-01 (to S.Be.), the Belgian national Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FnRS) PdR 0253.19 (to P.Be.), Fund for scientific development at the Faculty of Psychology at SWPS University in Warsaw (to O.Bi.), Radboud University Behavioral Science institute (to d.n.M.B.),","Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report Contribution of Working Groups I II and III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2023); Ivanova, Diana, Quantifying the potential for climate change mitigation of consumption options, Environmental Research Letters, 15, 9, (2020); Gifford, Robert, Behavioral dimensions of climate change: Drivers, responses, barriers, and interventions, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 2, 6, pp. 801-827, (2011); Otto, Ilona M., Social tipping dynamics for stabilizing Earth’s climate by 2050, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 5, pp. 2354-2365, (2020); Allcott, Hunt, Behavior and energy policy, Science, 327, 5970, pp. 1204-1205, (2010); Carattini, Stefano, How to win public support for a global carbon tax, Nature, 565, 7739, pp. 289-291, (2019); Jenny, Mirjam Annina, Large-scale behavioural data are key to climate policy, Nature Human Behaviour, 6, 11, pp. 1444-1447, (2022); Composto, Jordana W., Effectiveness of behavioural interventions to reduce household energy demand: A scoping review, Environmental Research Letters, 17, 6, (2022); Nisa, Claudia F., Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials testing behavioural interventions to promote household action on climate change, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Jones, Charlotte, The Future is Now: Reducing Psychological Distance to Increase Public Engagement with Climate Change, Risk Analysis, 37, 2, pp. 331-341, (2017)","","American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","","","23752548","","","38324680","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184670116"

The vast number of tree species presents a formidable challenge to understanding these forests, including their response to environmental change, as very little is known about most tropical tree species. A focus on the common species may circumvent this challenge. Here we investigate abundance patterns of common tree species using inventory data on 1,003,805 trees with trunk diameters of at least 10 cm across 1,568 locations 1–6 in closed-canopy, structurally intact old-growth tropical forests in Africa, Amazonia and Southeast Asia. We estimate that 2.2%, 2.2% and 2.3% of species comprise 50% of the tropical trees in these regions, respectively. Extrapolating across all closed-canopy tropical forests, we estimate that just 1,053 species comprise half of Earth’s 800 billion tropical trees with trunk diameters of at least 10 cm. Despite differing biogeographic, climatic and anthropogenic histories 7, we find notably consistent patterns of common species and species abundance distributions across the continents. This suggests that fundamental mechanisms of tree community assembly may apply to all tropical forests. Resampling analyses show that the most common species are likely to belong to a manageable list of known species, enabling targeted efforts to understand their ecology. Although they do not detract from the importance of rare species, our results open new opportunities to understand the world’s most diverse forests, including modelling their response to environmental change, by focusing on the common species that constitute the majority of their trees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Canopy Architecture; Forest Inventory; Relative Abundance; Tree; Tropical Forest; Africa; Article; Canopy; Environmental Change; Forest; Nonhuman; Plant Community; Population Abundance; Southeast Asia; Surgery; Ecosystem; Tropic Climate; Amazonia; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Forests; Trees; Tropical Climate","biodiversity; canopy architecture; forest inventory; relative abundance; tree; tropical forest; Africa; article; canopy; environmental change; forest; nonhuman; plant community; population abundance; Southeast Asia; surgery; ecosystem; tropic climate; Amazonia; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Forests; Trees; Tropical Climate","","","Funding text 1: D.L.M.C. was supported by the London Natural Environmental Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership grant (grant no.

Adding to the burden of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCD) are becoming more prevalent due to socio-economic development that changes lifestyles in an aging population resulting in significant increases in life expectancy. The shifting disease burden drives healthcare systems to change accordingly to provide an adequate response. In the meantime, unsolved problems of inequality, shortage of medical personnel, and high prevalence of infectious diseases remain significant, putting massive pressure on the limited resources of healthcare systems in LICs and LMICs. This is where digital health brings its promising potential, firstly to better understand the disease burden itself for an accurate conception of the health risks for the population, secondly to develop new solutions that will improve the efficiency of the current healthcare ecosystem, alleviating constraints and overcoming the lack of resources, and finally to provide better health outcomes for individuals as a customer-centric solution. Applications like health information technology (health IT) with electronic health records (EHR) offer an inclusive perspective on a patient’s total health and access to all healthcare providers, insurers, and other healthcare stakeholders. Mobile applications and wearables empower and engage patients in self-care management while real-time monitoring, collection, and exchange of their health status provide a continuous image of their health. Such solutions used together can build a strong history of a patient’s health status, and the data can then be used in conjunction with other data, such as genomics, etc., for early detection of many kinds of diseases, providing space and time for rapid treatment through personalized and precise medicine that works better for each individual, going towards more preventive care and wellbeing, which is particularly effective in managing NCDs. On the other hand, telehealth, using digital information and communication technologies, has already proven its usefulness in dealing with communicable diseases, as recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, while improving healthcare access and cost for rural, remote, and marginalized communities. The applications vary and are constantly updated as new technologies emerge, with numerous interrelated factors driving the changes.Shifting Disease Burden This chapter studies LMICs in particular as they are the most strained and impacted by the double burdenDouble Burden and provide us with insights into the challenges and the opportunities that emerge with digital health solutions as contenders. Amongst LMICs, Vietnam is an interesting case due to its rapid socio-economic growth that brings homegrown solutions to the local and foreign markets, while facing important health and inequality issues. As such, in dealing with the double burdenDouble Burden and particularly for LMICs, digital health promises to be the answer for gaining equitable and universal access to high-quality healthcare that is both cost-effective and affordable. In highlighting this, indicative examples will be presented to illustrate the point. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Health; Double Burden; Health Ecosystems; Low- And-middle Income Countries (lmic); Shifting Disease Burden","","","","","undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Digital Health in Vietnam A Guide to Market","","Springer","","","","","","25233084; 25233092","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204201512"

Despite such national efforts, faculty members’ study abroad outcomes are yet to be assessed in depth. The chapter reveals statistically significant differences between the study abroad (SA) and study at home (SH) groups in terms of impact on education, research, and management activities. The SA group made notable contributions, particularly in innovating education modules and expanding international education activities. In terms of research, the research skills and methodologies acquired while studying abroad enabled them to be more productive through research outputs. Moreover, university management was impacted by their SA experiences through the choices of strategies employed once they returned to Vietnamese universities. Conversely, some participants experienced adverse impacts on career development once back in Vietnam, such as reverse culture shock. Overall, the chapter demonstrates the positive contribution of SA to knowledge, skills, and value development in cultivating human capital for national development, as intended by national policies and programs since the Doi Moi era. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Education And Research Activities; Higher Education; Internationalization; Study Abroad Experience; Vietnamese Faculty Members","","","","After receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in Vietnam, Dr. Le began looking for opportunities to study abroad. She received scholarship offers from the Japanese and Australian governments as well as the US Fulbright Foundation. The first scholarship letter arrived from Japan, so she chose Japan as her SA destination. She enrolled at a national university in Japan for an MA in area studies, a field in which the academic community is very diverse. She took classes with not only Japanese professors but also German, Canadian, and French academics, and the classrooms were filled with international students like Dr. Le. She learned that the pedagogy at her Japanese university differed greatly from what she was used to in Vietnam. In particular, she noticed that the courses in Japan were largely constructed around discussion and presentations rather than lectures. In addition, assessment was very different, as the students were required to submit essays and reports, and give presentations, while examinations were more common in Vietnam.","Ackers, Louise, Moving people and knowledge: Scientific mobility in the European Union, International Migration, 43, 5, pp. 99-131, (2005); Era Conference an Enlarged Europe for Researchers, (2001); Journal of International and Comparative Education, (2017); Student and Skilled Labour Mobility in the Asia Pacific Region Reflecting the Emerging Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2023); 50 Years of US Study Abroad Students Japan as the Gateway to Asia and Beyond, (2019); Asada, Sarah R., Study abroad and knowledge diplomacy: increasing awareness and connectivity to the host country, host region, and world, Compare, 51, 4, pp. 580-595, (2021); Asada, Sarah R., Going beyond the binary of internationalisation: how international faculty programmes enable institutions to function at home and abroad, Globalisation, Societies and Education, 22, 4, pp. 707-719, (2024); Boni, Alejandra, Education for Global Citizenship at Universities: Potentialities of Formal and Informal Learning Spaces to Foster Cosmopolitanism, Journal of Studies in International Education, 21, 1, pp. 22-38, (2017); International Service Learning Conceptual Frameworks and Research, (2011); Campbell, Anne C., ‘Giving back’ to one’s country following an international higher education scholarship: comparing in-country and expatriate alumni perceptions of engagement in social and economic change in Moldova, Compare, 50, 4, pp. 573-591, (2020)","","Springer","","","","","","25233084; 25233092","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201803524"

It synthesizes the findings of the case studies presented in Chaps. 4 through 13, adding new comparative perspectives, such as country of origin and country of destination. Key findings are, firstly, that faculty study abroad experiences have positive impacts on academics’ subsequent teaching and research activities, particularly in the context of universities’ expanding international engagement, which has recently gained momentum in Southeast Asia. Secondly, the impacts vary in magnitude, with Vietnam and Cambodia showing more pronounced effects than Malaysia and Indonesia. This suggests that as domestic graduate education progresses, the impacts of study abroad tend to diminish. Striking a balance between promoting domestic graduate programs and strengthening internationalization through faculty experience abroad becomes critical. Finally, our research underscores the unique strengths of different host countries. Some destinations, such as Japan and the Netherlands, excel at facilitating faculty research activities, while others, such as France and the United States, are notable for fostering faculty teaching skills. Diversifying study abroad destinations allows universities to tap into a wide range of strengths, enriching the overall academic landscape. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Academic Mobility; Faculty Members; Higher Education Internationalization; Impact; Southeast Asia; Study Abroad","","","","","International Educator, (2000); Teachers College Record, (1981); Decline of the Guru the Academic Profession in Developing and Middle Income Countries, (2003); Asian Universities Historical Perspectives and Contemporary Challenges, (2004); Altbach, Philip G., Globalization and the University: Realities in an Unequal World, Springer International Handbooks of Education, 18, pp. 121-139, (2007); Altbach, Philip G., World class worldwide: Transforming research universities in Asia and Latin America, pp. 1-323, (2007); Japan as the Gateway to Asia and Beyond the Long Term Impacts of US Undergraduate Study Abroad Experiences Doctoral Dissertation, (2017); undefined; International Service Learning Conceptual Frameworks and Research, (2011); Globalization and Transnational Academic Mobility the Experiences of Chinese Academic Returnees, (2017)","","Springer","","","","","","25233084; 25233092","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201796299"

Remote-sensing estimates to quantify carbon losses from global forests 2–5 are characterized by considerable uncertainty and we lack a comprehensive ground-sourced evaluation to benchmark these estimates. Here we combine several ground-sourced 6 and satellite-derived approaches 2,7,8 to evaluate the scale of the global forest carbon potential outside agricultural and urban lands. Despite regional variation, the predictions demonstrated remarkable consistency at a global scale, with only a 12% difference between the ground-sourced and satellite-derived estimates. At present, global forest carbon storage is markedly under the natural potential, with a total deficit of 226 Gt (model range = 151–363 Gt) in areas with low human footprint. Most (61%, 139 Gt C) of this potential is in areas with existing forests, in which ecosystem protection can allow forests to recover to maturity. The remaining 39% (87 Gt C) of potential lies in regions in which forests have been removed or fragmented. Although forests cannot be a substitute for emissions reductions, our results support the idea 2,3,9 that the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of diverse forests offer valuable contributions to meeting global climate and biodiversity targets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Carbon; Assessment Method; Biodiversity; Carbon Emission; Carbon Storage; Emission Control; Environmental Protection; Global Climate; Article; Biomass; Carbon Cycling; Climate Change; Ecosystem Restoration; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Sustainability; Forest; Human Impact (environment); Land Use; Nonhuman; Remote Sensing; Urban Area; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Human; Procedures; Carbon; Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans","assessment method; biodiversity; carbon emission; carbon storage; emission control; environmental protection; global climate; Article; biomass; carbon cycling; climate change; ecosystem restoration; environmental monitoring; environmental sustainability; forest; human impact (environment); land use; nonhuman; remote sensing; urban area; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; human; procedures; carbon; Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon","We sincerely acknowledge S.

Hydrogen has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; therefore, we hypothesized that hydrogen would alleviate endothelial glycocalyx damage caused by CPB. Twenty-eight male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7 per group), as follows: sham, control, 2% hydrogen, and 4% hydrogen. The rats were subjected to 90 minutes of partial CPB followed by 120 minutes of observation. In the hydrogen groups, hydrogen was administered via the ventilator and artificial lung during CPB, and via the ventilator for 60 minutes after CPB. After observation, blood collection, lung extraction, and perfusion fixation were performed, and the heart, lung, and brain endothelial glycocalyx thickness was measured by electron microscopy. The serum syndecan-1 concentration, a glycocalyx component, in the 4% hydrogen group (5.7 ± 4.4 pg/mL) was lower than in the control (19.5 ± 6.6 pg/mL) and 2% hydrogen (19.8 ± 5.0 pg/mL) groups (P < 0.001 for each), but it was not significantly different from the sham group (6.2 ± 4.0 pg/mL, P = 0.999). The endothelial glycocalyces of the heart and lung in the 4% hydrogen group were thicker than in the control group. The 4% hydrogen group had lower inflammatory cytokine concentrations (interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) in serum and lung tissue, as well as a lower serum malondialdehyde concentration, than the control group. The 2% hydrogen group showed no significant difference in the serum syndecan-1 concentration compared with the control group. However, non-significant decreases in serum and lung tissue inflammatory cytokine concentrations, as well as in serum malondialdehyde concentration, were observed. Administration of 4% hydrogen via artificial and autologous lungs attenuated endothelial glycocalyx damage caused by partial CPB in rats, which might be mediated by the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of hydrogen. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hydrogen; Malonaldehyde; Syndecan 1; Anti-inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Cytokines; Hydrogen; Malondialdehyde; Syndecan-1; Abl90 Flex; Jem-1400 Plus; Nanozoomer S60; Cytokine; Hydrogen; Interleukin 1beta; Malonaldehyde; Syndecan 1; Tumor Necrosis Factor; Antiinflammatory Agent; Antioxidant; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Antiinflammatory Activity; Antioxidant Activity; Article; Blood Gas Analysis; Blood Pressure Monitoring; Brain; Breathing Rate; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Central Venous Pressure; Controlled Study; Electron Microscopy; Endothelial Glycocalyx Damage; Endothelial Glycocalyx Thickness; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Extracorporeal Oxygenation; Glycocalyx; Heart; Heart Rate; Inflammation; Injury; Lung; Lung Parenchyma; Lung Wet-dry Weight Ratio; Male; Mean Arterial Pressure; Nonhuman; Oxidative Stress; Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation; Rat; Sprague Dawley Rat; Thickness; Tidal Volume; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Animal; Animals; Anti-inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Cytokines; Glycocalyx; Hydrogen; Male; Malondialdehyde; Rats; Rats, Sprague-dawley; Syndecan-1","cytokine; hydrogen; interleukin 1beta; malonaldehyde; syndecan 1; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; blood gas analysis; blood pressure monitoring; brain; breathing rate; cardiopulmonary bypass; central venous pressure; controlled study; electron microscopy; endothelial glycocalyx damage; endothelial glycocalyx thickness; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; extracorporeal oxygenation; glycocalyx; heart; heart rate; inflammation; injury; lung; lung parenchyma; lung wet-dry weight ratio; male; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; oxidative stress; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; thickness; tidal volume; transmission electron microscopy; animal; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Cytokines; Glycocalyx; Hydrogen; Male; Malondialdehyde; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Syndecan-1","","hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; malonaldehyde, 542-78-9; syndecan 1, 128559-86-4; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Cytokines; Hydrogen; Malondialdehyde; Syndecan-1","Funding: This research was supported by grant from JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K09324 and JP21K08920, and HUSM Grant-in-Aid.

Here, we provide insights into H. pylori population structure as a part of the Helicobacter pylori Genome Project (HpGP), a multi-disciplinary initiative aimed at elucidating H. pylori pathogenesis and identifying new therapeutic targets. We collected 1011 well-characterized clinical strains from 50 countries and generated high-quality genome sequences. We analysed core genome diversity and population structure of the HpGP dataset and 255 worldwide reference genomes to outline the ancestral contribution to Eurasian, African, and American populations. We found evidence of substantial contribution of population hpNorthAsia and subpopulation hspUral in Northern European H. pylori. The genomes of H. pylori isolated from northern and southern Indigenous Americans differed in that bacteria isolated in northern Indigenous communities were more similar to North Asian H. pylori while the southern had higher relatedness to hpEastAsia. Notably, we also found a highly clonal yet geographically dispersed North American subpopulation, which is negative for the cag pathogenicity island, and present in 7% of sequenced US genomes. We expect the HpGP dataset and the corresponding strains to become a major asset for H. pylori genomics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genome; Pathogenicity; Population Structure; Relatedness; Subpopulation; African; Article; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Strain; Bacterial Virulence; Bacterium Isolation; Consanguinity; Controlled Study; Core Genome; East Asian; Genetic Variability; Helicobacter Pylori; Human; Indigenous People; Nonhuman; North American; North Asian; Northern European; Pathogenicity Island; Population Dispersion; Genetics; Genomics; Helicobacter Infection; Microbiology; Nucleotide Sequence; Population Group; Europe; Base Sequence; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Population Groups","genome; pathogenicity; population structure; relatedness; subpopulation; African; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium isolation; consanguinity; controlled study; core genome; East Asian; genetic variability; Helicobacter pylori; human; indigenous people; nonhuman; North American; North Asian; Northern European; pathogenicity island; population dispersion; genetics; genomics; Helicobacter infection; microbiology; nucleotide sequence; population group; Europe; Base Sequence; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Population Groups","","","Funding text 1: Our special thanks are extended to all the individuals who were the hosts of the strains of the Hp GP collection, who represent the human populations that bear the burden of H. pylori -associated disease, and whose biological samples serve to advance research aimed at reducing this disease burden.

This study aimed to develop a robust yeast strain of P. kudriavzevii via the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) technique. The parental strain of P. kudriavzevii was subjected to repetitive long-term cultivation in medium supplemented with a gradually increasing concentration of acetic acid, the major weak acid liberated during the lignocellulosic pretreatment process. Three evolved P. kudriavzevii strains, namely, PkAC-7, PkAC-8, and PkAC-9, obtained in this study exhibited significantly higher resistance toward multiple stressors, including heat, ethanol, osmotic stress, acetic acid, formic acid, furfural, 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (5-HMF), and vanillin. The fermentation efficiency of the evolved strains was also improved, yielding a higher ethanol concentration, productivity, and yield than the parental strain, using undetoxified sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate as feedstock. These findings provide evidence that ALE is a practical approach for increasing the multistress tolerance of P. kudriavzevii for stable and efficient second-generation bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetic Acid; Alcohol; Cellulose; Furfural; Lignocellulose; Acetic Acid; Cellulose; Ethanol; Furaldehyde; Lignocellulose; Acetic Acid; Alcohol; Cellulose; Furfural; Lignocellulose; Biomass; Fermentation; Metabolism; Pichia Kudriavzevii; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Sugarcane; Acetic Acid; Biomass; Cellulose; Ethanol; Fermentation; Furaldehyde; Saccharum","acetic acid; alcohol; cellulose; furfural; lignocellulose; biomass; fermentation; metabolism; Pichia kudriavzevii; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sugarcane; Acetic Acid; Biomass; Cellulose; Ethanol; Fermentation; Furaldehyde; Saccharum","","acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1, 6131-90-4; alcohol, 64-17-5; cellulose, 61991-22-8, 68073-05-2, 9004-34-6; furfural, 98-01-1; lignocellulose, 11132-73-3; Acetic Acid; Cellulose; Ethanol; Furaldehyde; lignocellulose","Funding text 1: The authors thank the Mitr Phu Wiang Sugar Factory, Khon Kaen, Thailand, for providing sugarcane bagasse, and also the Fermentation Research Center for Value Added Agricultural Products (FerVAAPs), Khon Kaen University, Thailand, for all facilities used in this study.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the Fundamental Fund of Khon Kaen University in the fiscal year 2023.

Exposure levels were indicated by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dibenzodioxin (TCDD) and toxic equivalent of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (TEQ-PCDD/Fs) levels in maternal breast milk. The percentage of the total fixation duration on the face (% Face), mouth (% Mouth), and eye areas (% Eyes) when viewing silent and conversation scenes was used as gaze behavior indices. When they reached 3-year-old, autistic behavior was assessed using the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS). A general linear model adjusted for confounding factors was used to compare gaze indices and ASRS scores between high and low dioxin exposure groups. Effects of perinatal dioxin exposure on gaze behavior were found only when viewing conversation scenes indicated by lower % Face for boys in high TCDD exposure group and lower % Eyes for girls in high TEQ-PCDD/Fs group.

Following an initial single-center survey conducted in 2020, we conducted a second survey of 11 antiretroviral therapy (ART) sites in Northern Vietnam between June 2021 and January 2022. We tested anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) nucleocapsid IgG antibodies and assessed prevention against COVID-19 and impacts of COVID-19 on access to ART, economic security, risky health behaviors, and mental health using self-reported questionnaires. In total, 7808 PLHIV on ART participated in the second survey. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was as low as 1.2%. There was no clear upward trend in COVID-19 infection among PLHIV compared with the rate of infection among the general population. HIV treatment was generally maintained and no increase in risky health behaviors was observed. The economic impacts were significant, with high unemployment rate, poorer economic security, and binge drinking strongly associated with depression. However, the prevalence of depression decreased by 11.2% compared with pre-COVID-19 levels. Social support, including for patients to continue HIV treatment and effective employment/financial assistance, may help to alleviate the negative socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 and improve mental health among PLHIV. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Trial; Complication; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Multicenter Study; Questionnaire; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Viet Nam; Covid-19; Hiv Infections; Humans; Sars-cov-2; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam","clinical trial; complication; coronavirus disease 2019; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; multicenter study; questionnaire; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Viet Nam; COVID-19; HIV Infections; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","","Funding text 1: This study was financially supported by a JICA/AMED SATREPS project for “Establishment of the ‘Bench-to-Bedside’ Feedback System for Sustainable ART and the Prevention of New HIV Transmission in Vietnam”.

A low-cost nanotechnological material method was employed for this work. The binary structure component consists of 17,557 nano-sized rods made of two lead–bismuth–gallium silicate glasses which were developed in-house. Those small rods are spatially arranged in such a way that, according to effective medium theory, the refractive index of this internal structure is constant in the radial direction and linearly changes following azimuthal angle. Numerical results demonstrated that a nanostructured vortex phase mask with a thickness of 19 μm can convert Gaussian beams into fundamental optical vortices over 290 nm wavelength bandwidth from 1275 to 1565 nm. This has been confirmed in experiments using three diode laser sources operating at 1310, 1550, and 1565 nm. The generation of vortex beams is verified through their uniform doughnut-like intensity distributions, clear astigmatic transformation patterns, and spiral as well as fork-like interferograms. This new flat-surface component can be directly mounted to an optical fiber tip for simplifying vortex generator systems as well as easier manipulation of the generated OVB in three-dimensional space. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gallium; Gallium; Glass; Glass Fiber; Article; Astigmatism; Bandwidth; Controlled Study; Diode Laser; Generator; Mask; Optics; Refraction Index; Thickness","gallium; glass; glass fiber; article; astigmatism; bandwidth; controlled study; diode laser; generator; mask; optics; refraction index; thickness","","gallium, 7440-55-3, 14391-02-7","This work was supported by Narodowe Centrum Nauki (PRELUDIUM-20 UMO-2021/41/N/ST7/01517), HORIZON EIC Pathfinder (ReaCtor 101099405), Kakenhi Grants-in-Aid (Nos.

For most nations, recent estimates and trends of intake are not available; nor variation by education or urbanicity. We investigated SSB intakes among adults between 1990 and 2018 in 185 countries, stratified subnationally by age, sex, education, and rural/urban residence, using data from the Global Dietary Database. In 2018, mean global SSB intake was 2.7 (8 oz = 248 grams) servings/week (95% UI 2.5-2.9) (range: 0.7 (0.5-1.1) in South Asia to 7.8 (7.1-8.6) in Latin America/Caribbean). Intakes were higher in male vs. female, younger vs. older, more vs. less educated, and urban vs. rural adults. Variations by education and urbanicity were largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1990 and 2018, SSB intakes increased by +0.37 (+0.29, +0.47), with the largest increase in Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings inform intervention, surveillance, and policy actions worldwide, highlighting the growing problem of SSBs for public health in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Beverage; Cardiovascular Disease; Dietary Intake; Education; Public Health; Africa; Asia; Latin America; South Asia; Sub-saharan Africa; Adult; Diet; Educational Status; Ethnicity; Female; Human; Male; Sugar-sweetened Beverage; Adult; Beverages; Diet; Educational Status; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Male; Sugar-sweetened Beverages","beverage; cardiovascular disease; dietary intake; education; public health; Africa; Asia; Latin America; South Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; adult; diet; educational status; ethnicity; female; human; male; sugar-sweetened beverage; Adult; Beverages; Diet; Educational Status; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Male; Sugar-Sweetened Beverages","","","Funding text 1: The investigators did not receive funding from a pharmaceutical company or other agency to write this report.

We aimed to clarify the clinical and molecular epidemiological features of hMPV. We conducted an ARI surveillance targeting hospitalized children aged 1 month to 14 years in Nha Trang, Vietnam. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for respiratory viruses with PCR. We described the clinical characteristics of hMPV patients in comparison with those with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and those with neither RSV nor hMPV, and among different hMPV genotypes. Among 8822 patients, 278 (3.2%) were hMPV positive, with a median age of 21.0 months (interquartile range: 12.7–32.5). Among single virus-positive patients, hMPV cases were older than patients with RSV (p < 0.001) and without RSV (p = 0.003). The proportions of clinical pneumonia and wheezing in hMPV patients resembled those in RSV patients but were higher than in non-RSV non-hMPV patients. Seventy percent (n = 195) were genotyped (A2b: n = 40, 20.5%; A2c: n = 99, 50.8%; B1: n = 37, 19%; and B2: n = 19, 9.7%).

This paper addresses key control challenges linked to the T–S system and presents important considerations to ensure its successful application using the Lyapunov theorem. One crucial aspect is determining the optimal number of premise variables and selecting accurate fuzzy rules for the T–S model. Additionally, the theorem based on Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) is developed to enable effective disturbance rejection. To enhance stability control, constraints are imposed on the output angle and control input of a rotary inverted pendulum (RIP). By integrating T–S fuzzy control, disturbance rejection, and input/output constraints, robust stability in controlling the RIP is achieved. Extensive simulations are performed to showcase the efficiency of the suggested method, and the simulation results are thoroughly discussed and analyzed to verify the efficacy of the control method. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Comparative Effectiveness; Fuzzy Logic; Simulation","article; comparative effectiveness; fuzzy logic; simulation","","","","Moatimid, Galal Mahrous, Dynamical analysis of an inverted pendulum with positive position feedback controller approximate uniform solution, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Waszak, Michal, An Automatic Self-Tuning Control System Design for an Inverted Pendulum, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 26726-26738, (2020); Nguyen, Ngo Phong, A nonlinear hybrid controller for swinging-up and stabilizing the rotary inverted pendulum, Nonlinear Dynamics, 104, 2, pp. 1117-1137, (2021); Huang, Jingwen, Control of Rotary Inverted Pendulum Using Model-Free Backstepping Technique, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 96965-96973, (2019); Nguyen, Ngo Phong, Fuzzy-Based Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Stabilization Control for Under-Actuated Rotary Inverted Pendulum Systems, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 185079-185092, (2020); Mahmoodadi, M.

Besides cigarettes, the most common form of tobacco smoking, there was sparse evidence of waterpipe’s carcinogenicity-induced nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). This study investigated the association between waterpipe smoking and NPC mortality. Our study followed up with 20,144 eligible man participants from nine northern Vietnam communes between 2007 and 2019. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to gather data on exclusive waterpipe and cigarette smoking and dietary intake using structured semi-quantitative food frequency and lifestyle questionnaires. Nasopharyngeal cancer was determined by accessing the medical records at the state health facilities. We estimated the Cox proportional hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals, HR (95% CI). The proportion of never smokers, exclusive waterpipe, exclusive cigarette, and dual waterpipe and cigarette smokers was 55.8%, 14.5%, 16.6%, and 13.1%, respectively. Exclusively waterpipe smokers increased the risk of NPC death compared to exclusively cigarette smokers, HR (95% CI): 4.51 (1.25, 16.31), p = 0.022. A dose-dependent positive relationship between NPC and exclusive waterpipe smoking was significantly seen for higher intensity HR (95% CI): 1.35 (1.07, 1.71), earlier age of smoking initiation HR (95% CI): 1.26 (1.06, 1.50), longer duration HR (95% CI): 1.31 (1.04, 1.66), and the cumulative number of a smoke lifetime HR (95% CI): 1.37 (1.08, 1.74). We observed a significant positive association between exclusive waterpipe smoking and NPC in men. The findings suggested that waterpipe smoking is likely more harmful than cigarettes in developing this cancer. A firm tobacco control against waterpipe smoking is highly recommended. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human; Male; Nasopharynx Tumor; Prospective Study; Southeast Asian; Viet Nam; Water Pipe Smoking; Humans; Male; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Southeast Asian People; Vietnam; Water Pipe Smoking","human; male; nasopharynx tumor; prospective study; Southeast Asian; Viet Nam; water pipe smoking; Humans; Male; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Southeast Asian People; Vietnam; Water Pipe Smoking","","","The authors would like to thank all the participants in the three northern provinces of Vietnam for the time and effort they devoted to this study.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying heterosis remains unclear. This study took advantage of Arabidopsis intraspecific hybrids to identify heterosis-related metabolites. Forty-six intraspecific hybrids were used to examine parental effects on seed area and germination time. The degree of heterosis was evaluated based on biomass: combinations showing high heterosis of F<inf>1</inf> hybrids exhibited a biomass increase from 6.1 to 44% over the better parent value (BPV), whereas that of the low- and no-heterosis hybrids ranged from − 19.8 to 9.8% over the BPV. Metabolomics analyses of F<inf>1</inf> hybrids with high heterosis and those with low one suggested that changes in TCA cycle intermediates are key factors that control growth. Notably, higher fumarate/malate ratios were observed in the high heterosis F<inf>1</inf> hybrids, suggesting they provide metabolic support associated with the increased biomass. These hybrids may produce more energy-intensive biomass by speeding up the efficiency of TCA fluxes. However, the expression levels of TCA-process-related genes in F<inf>1</inf> hybrids were not associated with the intensity of heterosis, suggesting that the post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation of these genes may affect the productivity of the intermediates in the TCA cycle. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Arabidopsis; Biomass; Citric Acid Cycle; Metabolomics; Agriculture; Biomass; Citric Acid Cycle; Metabolomics","agriculture; Arabidopsis; biomass; citric acid cycle; metabolomics; Agriculture; Biomass; Citric Acid Cycle; Metabolomics","","","Funding text 1: We thank Prof. Kazuki Saito (RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science) for helpful discussions regarding the experiments.

In horses, the Y chromosome shows a limited, but highly informative, sequence diversity, supporting the increasing breeding influence of Oriental lineages during the last 1500 years. Here, we augment the primary horse Y-phylogeny, which is currently mainly based on modern horse breeds of economic interest, with haplotypes (HT) segregating in remote horse populations around the world. We analyze target enriched sequencing data of 5 Mb of the Y chromosome from 76 domestic males, together with 89 whole genome sequenced domestic males and five Przewalski’s horses from previous studies. The resulting phylogeny comprises 153 HTs defined by 2966 variants and offers unprecedented resolution into the history of horse paternal lineages. It reveals the presence of a remarkable number of previously unknown haplogroups in Mongolian horses and insular populations. Phylogenetic placement of HTs retrieved from 163 archaeological specimens further indicates that most of the present-day Y-chromosomal variation evolved after the domestication process that started around 4200 years ago in the Western Eurasian steppes. Our comprehensive phylogeny significantly reduces ascertainment bias and constitutes a robust evolutionary framework for analyzing horse population dynamics and diversity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Mitochondrial; Adult; Article; Ascertainment Bias; Domestication; Haplogroup; Haplotype; Horse; Horse Breed; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nonhuman; Phylogenetic Tree; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics; Przewalski's Horse; Steppe; Y Chromosome; Animal; Evolution; Genetic Variation; Genetics; Genome; Wild Animal; Mitochondrial Dna; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biological Evolution; Dna, Mitochondrial; Genetic Variation; Genome; Haplotypes; Horses; Male; Phylogeny; Y Chromosome","adult; article; ascertainment bias; domestication; haplogroup; haplotype; horse; horse breed; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; population dynamics; Przewalski's horse; steppe; Y chromosome; animal; evolution; genetic variation; genetics; genome; wild animal; mitochondrial DNA; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biological Evolution; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetic Variation; Genome; Haplotypes; Horses; Male; Phylogeny; Y Chromosome","","DNA, Mitochondrial","E.B. was funded by the Austrian Science Funds (FWF, W1225).

We report here the full genomes of H. pylori strains CHC155 and VN1291 isolated from a non-cardia gastric cancer patient and a duodenal ulcer patient, respectively, and their virulence demonstrated by in vitro infection. Whole-genome sequences were obtained by combining long- and short-reads with a hybrid-assembly approach. Both CHC155 and VN1291 genome possessed four kinds of genomic island: a cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), two type 4 secretion system islands within an integrative and conjugative element (tfs ICE), and prophage. CHC155 and VN1291 carried East Asian-type cagA and vacA s1m1, and outer membrane protein genes, including two copies of oipA. Corresponded to genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance, chromosomal mutations were identified in CHC155 (rdxA, gyrA, and 23S rRNA) and VN1291 (rdxA, 23S rRNA, and pbp1A). In vitro infection of AGS cells by both strains induced the cell scattering phenotype, tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA, and promoted high levels of IL8 secretion, indicating fully intact phenotypes of the cagPAI. Virulence genes in CHC155 and VN1291 genomes are crucial for H. pylori pathogenesis and are risk factors in the development of gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer. Our in vitro studies indicate that the strains CHC155 and VN1291 carry the pathogenic potential. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Rna, Ribosomal, 23s; Bacterial Antigen; Bacterial Protein; Rna 23s; Complication; Duodenum Ulcer; Genetics; Genomics; Helicobacter Infection; Helicobacter Pylori; Human; Metabolism; Microbiology; Southeast Asian; Stomach Tumor; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Duodenal Ulcer; Genomics; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Rna, Ribosomal, 23s; Southeast Asian People; Stomach Neoplasms","bacterial antigen; bacterial protein; RNA 23S; complication; duodenum ulcer; genetics; genomics; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; human; metabolism; microbiology; Southeast Asian; stomach tumor; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Duodenal Ulcer; Genomics; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; RNA, Ribosomal, 23S; Southeast Asian People; Stomach Neoplasms","","Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; RNA, Ribosomal, 23S","Funding text 1: We extend our sincere thanks to all colleagues in the Department of Environmental and Preventive Medicine, Oita University and the Faculty of Applied Technology, Van Lang University, Vietnam for contributing to this research paper.

One of the ideas for shielding high particle and heat fluxes is to apply an external magnetic field generated by injecting current filaments. In this work, we model a flow of plasma, which includes electrons and ions in a small region, by using two spatial dimensions and three coordinates for velocities (2D3V) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code to study the effects of the injected current filaments on particle and heat fluxes to the wall. The plasma enters the simulation domain from the source region at the left boundary and is fully absorbed in the conductor wall at the right boundary. Current filaments are injected to change the magnetic field structure of the system. We compare particle density, particle flux, and heat flux with and without injecting the current filaments into the domain in two dimensions. Based on the simulation results, we found that injecting current filaments can reduce the peak fluxes to the wall and transfer some of those fluxes along the wall. Therefore, injecting the current filaments is a good candidate for shielding satellites and spacecraft from high-energy ion and electron fluxes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Chen, Hongfei, High energy charged particle experiment - A payload proposal to KuaFu-B mission, Advances in Space Research, 44, 1, pp. 39-45, (2009); undefined, (2009); Anderson, Phillip C., Characteristics of spacecraft charging in low Earth orbit, Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, 117, 7, (2012); Pilipenko, Viatcheslav Anatolievich, Statistical relationships between satellite anomalies at geostationary orbit and high-energy particles, Advances in Space Research, 37, 6, pp. 1192-1205, (2006); Janeschitz, Guenter, Plasma-wall interaction issues in ITER, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 290-293, pp. 1-11, (2001); Crisanti, Flavio, FAST: A European ITER satellite experiment in the view of DEMO, Fusion Engineering and Design, 86, 6-8, pp. 497-503, (2011); Cour-Palais, Burton G., A multi-shock concept for spacecraft shielding, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 10, 1-4, pp. 135-146, (1990); Townsend, Lawrence W., Overview of active methods for shielding spacecraft from energetic space radiation, Physica Medica, 17, SUPPL. 1, pp. 84-85, (2001); Matthews, Guy F., Plasma detachment from divertor targets and limiters, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 220-222, pp. 104-116, (1995); Schmitz, Oliver, Three-dimensional modeling of plasma edge transport and divertor fluxes during application of resonant magnetic perturbations on ITER, Nuclear Fusion, 56, 6, (2016)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","37221229","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159966710"

However, PAM is a nonlinear actuator with uncertainty and a considerable delay in characteristics, making control challenging. This study presents a discrete-time sliding mode control approach combined with the adaptive fuzzy algorithm (AFSMC) to deal with the unknown disturbance of the PAM-based actuator. The developed fuzzy logic system has parameter vectors of the component rules that are automatically updated by an adaptive law. Consequently, the developed fuzzy logic system can reasonably approximate the system disturbance.

Early identification and prevention rely on detailed epidemiological studies, which are limited in Asia. This retrospective study used the registry data of Pan-Asian Trauma Outcome Study (PATOS) from October 1, 2015 to December, 31, 2020. Pediatric patients (aged < 20 years) with non-accidental injuries were enrolled, which were divided by age into preschool (0–6 years), child (7–12 years), and adolescent (13–19 years) groups. Baseline characteristics, injury epidemiology, and excess mortality ratio-adjusted injury severity score (EMR-ISS) were collected. Major trauma was defined as an EMR-ISS score > 24. The study enrolled 451 patients with non-accidental injuries, accounting for 2.81% of pediatric trauma events presented to an emergency department in the PATOS registry. The overall mortality rate was 0.9%, similar to those in Western countries. Mortality rate was high in preschool children (8.7%, p = 0.017) than in other age groups. The sex-specific incidence was higher in boys (3.10% vs. 2.13%, p = 0.001).

It has vast potential applications from depth-circuit compressing to device benchmarking and quantum error mitigation. Here we propose a universal compilation algorithm for quantum state tomography in low-depth quantum circuits. We apply the Fubini-Study distance as a trainable cost function and employ various gradient-based optimizations. We evaluate the performance of various trainable unitary topologies and the trainability of different optimizers for getting high efficiency and reveal the crucial role of the circuit depth in robust fidelity. The results are comparable with the shadow tomography method, a similar fashion in the field. Our work expresses the adequate capability of the universal compilation algorithm to maximize the efficiency in the quantum state tomography. Further, it promises applications in quantum metrology and sensing and is applicable in the near-term quantum computers for various quantum computing tasks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work is supported by the VNUHCM-University of Information Technology’s Scientific Research Support Fund.","De Leon, Nathalie P., Materials challenges and opportunities for quantum computing hardware, Science, 372, 6539, (2021); Alexeev, Yuri, Quantum Computer Systems for Scientific Discovery, PRX Quantum, 2, 1, (2021); Ebadi, Sepehr, Quantum phases of matter on a 256-atom programmable quantum simulator, Nature, 595, 7866, pp. 227-232, (2021); Pirandola, Stefano, Advances in quantum teleportation, Nature Photonics, 9, 10, pp. 641-652, (2015); Spiller, Timothy P., Quantum information technology, Materials Today, 6, 1, pp. 30-36, (2003); Shor, Peter W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - Proceedings, pp. 124-134, (1994); Grover, Lov K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Part F129452, pp. 212-219, (1996); Harrow, Aram W., Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, Physical Review Letters, 103, 15, (2009); Xu, Xiaosi, Variational Circuit Compiler for Quantum Error Correction, Physical Review Applied, 15, 3, (2021); Lubasch, Michael, Variational quantum algorithms for nonlinear problems, Physical Review A, 101, 1, (2020)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","36879023","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149594156"

Nevertheless, this has been very challenging due to the lack of reliable room-temperature ferromagnetism in well-known group IV and III-V based semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature spin injection by using spin pumping in a BiSb/(Ga,Fe)Sb heterostructure, where (Ga,Fe)Sb is a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) with high Curie temperature (T<inf>C</inf>) and BiSb is a topological insulator (TI). Despite the very small magnetization of (Ga,Fe)Sb at room temperature (45 emu/cc), we detected spin injection from (Ga,Fe)Sb by utilizing the large inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in BiSb.

Although the mechanism of the spread of colistin-resistant bacteria in communities is unknown, geographic and regional characteristics may influence it. To elucidate the spread mechanism of colistin-resistant bacteria, we analyzed the genomes of colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from Vietnam and Ecuador residents, which are geographically and socially different. Stool specimens of 139 and 98 healthy residents from Ecuador and Vietnam rural communities, respectively, were analyzed for colistin-resistant E. coli with mcr. Its prevalence in the residents of all the communities assessed was high and approximately equal in both countries: 71.8% in Ecuador and 69.4% in Vietnam. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the sequence type of colistin-resistant E. coli was diverse and the major sequence types were different between the two countries. The location of mcr in the isolates showed that the proportion of chromosomal mcr was 35.1% and 8.5% in the Vietnam and Ecuador isolates, respectively. Most of these chromosomal mcr genes (75%–76%) had an intact mcr-transposon Tn6330. Contrastingly, the replicon types of the mcr-carrying-plasmids were diverse in both countries, but almost all belonged to IncI2 in Ecuador and IncX1/X4 in Vietnam. Approximately 26%–45% of these mcr-plasmids had other resistance genes, which also varied between countries. These results suggest that although the overall profile of the colistin-resistant E. coli isolates is diverse in these countries, the phylogenesis of the isolates and mcr-carrying plasmids has regional characteristics. Although the contributing factors are not clear, it is obvious that the overall profile of colistin-resistant bacteria dissemination varies between countries. Such different epidemic patterns are important for establishing country-specific countermeasures against colistin-resistant bacteria. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Colistin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Colistin; Escherichia Coli Proteins; Nanodrop; Colistin; Antiinfective Agent; Escherichia Coli Protein; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antibiotic Sensitivity; Article; Bacterial Genome; Bacterium Isolate; Child; Chromosome; Controlled Study; Dna Extraction; Epidemic; Escherichia Coli; Female; Genome Analysis; Human; Male; Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; Molecular Weight; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Nonhuman; Phylogenetic Tree; Phylogeny; Prevalence; Resident; Rural Population; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Transposon; Viet Nam; Whole Genome Sequencing; Antibiotic Resistance; Ecuador; Epidemiology; Genetics; Microbial Sensitivity Test; Plasmid; Anti-bacterial Agents; Colistin; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia Coli Proteins; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Phylogeny; Plasmids; Rural Population; Vietnam","colistin; antiinfective agent; Escherichia coli protein; adolescent; adult; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial genome; bacterium isolate; child; chromosome; controlled study; DNA extraction; epidemic; Escherichia coli; female; genome analysis; human; male; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular weight; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; prevalence; resident; rural population; single nucleotide polymorphism; transposon; Viet Nam; whole genome sequencing; antibiotic resistance; Ecuador; epidemiology; genetics; microbial sensitivity test; plasmid; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Colistin; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli Proteins; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Phylogeny; Plasmids; Rural Population; Vietnam","","colistin, 1066-17-7, 1264-72-8; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Colistin; Escherichia coli Proteins","The study was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant no. 20H00561 and 23H00446), JSPS Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects (grant no. 120229916) and Kobayashi Foundation (grant no. 283).

Ongoing developments in taxonomy, threatening processes and research further underscore the need for reassessment3,4. Here we report the findings of the second Global Amphibian Assessment, evaluating 8,011 species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. We find that amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate class (40.7% of species are globally threatened). The updated Red List Index shows that the status of amphibians is deteriorating globally, particularly for salamanders and in the Neotropics. Disease and habitat loss drove 91% of status deteriorations between 1980 and 2004. Ongoing and projected climate change effects are now of increasing concern, driving 39% of status deteriorations since 2004, followed by habitat loss (37%). Although signs of species recoveries incentivize immediate conservation action, scaled-up investment is urgently needed to reverse the current trends. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amphibian; Climate Change; Endangered Species; Extinction Risk; Habitat Loss; Neotropical Region; Red List; Amphibia; Article; Batrachochytrium Salamandrivorans; Chytridiomycosis; Degradation; Environmental Protection; Extinct Species; Neotropics; Nonhuman; Risk Factor; Salamander; Species Richness; Animal; Biodiversity; Species Extinction; Vertebrate; Amphibians; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Extinction, Biological; Vertebrates","amphibian; climate change; endangered species; extinction risk; habitat loss; Neotropical Region; Red List; Amphibia; Article; Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans; chytridiomycosis; degradation; environmental protection; extinct species; Neotropics; nonhuman; risk factor; salamander; species richness; animal; biodiversity; species extinction; vertebrate; Amphibians; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Extinction, Biological; Vertebrates","","","We thank each of the contributors named in the Supplementary Information and D.

Among 144 samples including Pangasius fish, wash water, food contact surfaces, and personnel gloves, 18 E. coli isolates was detected and characterized. The E. coli was detected most frequently in wash water samples (22%, 8/36), followed by Pangasius fish (18%, 8/45). According to the antibiotic susceptibility test by the disc diffusion method, isolates showed the highest resistance against sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (45%), followed by tetracycline (39%), whereas all the E. coli isolates were susceptible to meropenem and fosfomycin. Notably, 39% of the isolates (7/18) were found to be multidrug resistant while no E. coli isolates were confirmed as extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers by the double-disk synergy test. The potency to form biofilm on the polystyrene surface of E. coli isolates indicated that 44% of the isolates (8/18) were classified as weak, 39% (7/18) as moderate, and 17% (3/18) as strong biofilm formers. Interestingly, multidrug resistant E. coli isolates were observed in moderate and strong biofilm producers. Additionally, either slightly acidic hypochlorous water with 40 mg/L of available chlorine or sodium hypochlorite with 100 mg/L of available chlorine exhibited a significant reduction in biofilm mass and biofilm cells of E. coli isolates. This study may provide helpful information about the actual state of E. coli isolates for effective control in the fish processing plant. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibiotics Resistance; Biofilm Formation; Escherichia Coli; Pangasius Fish","","","","This work was supported by the Can Tho University Improvement Project VN14–P6, supported by a Japanese ODA loan.","Tong Thi, Anh Ngoc, Evaluation of the microbiological safety and quality of Vietnamese Pangasius hypophthalmus during processing by a microbial assessment scheme in combination with a self-assessment questionnaire, Fisheries Science, 80, 5, pp. 1117-1128, (2014); Trang Nguyen, Phan, Microbiological assessment of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus at fish-processing plants in Vietnam, Food Science and Technology Research, 28, 2, pp. 169-177, (2022); Noseda, Bert, Dynamics of microbiological quality and safety of Vietnamese Pangasianodon hypophthalmus during processing, Aquaculture International, 21, 3, pp. 709-727, (2013); Boss, Renate, Antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus from raw fish and seafood imported into Switzerland, Journal of Food Protection, 79, 7, pp. 1240-1246, (2016); Ellis-Iversen, Johanne, Antimicrobial resistant E. coli and enterococci in pangasius fillets and prawns in Danish retail imported from Asia., Food Control, 114, (2020); Salako, D.

Tree invasions in particular have been relatively overlooked, even though they have the potential to transform ecosystems and economies3,4. Here, leveraging global tree databases5–7, we explore how the phylogenetic and functional diversity of native tree communities, human pressure and the environment influence the establishment of non-native tree species and the subsequent invasion severity. We find that anthropogenic factors are key to predicting whether a location is invaded, but that invasion severity is underpinned by native diversity, with higher diversity predicting lower invasion severity. Temperature and precipitation emerge as strong predictors of invasion strategy, with non-native species invading successfully when they are similar to the native community in cold or dry extremes. Yet, despite the influence of these ecological forces in determining invasion strategy, we find evidence that these patterns can be obscured by human activity, with lower ecological signal in areas with higher proximity to shipping ports. Our global perspective of non-native tree invasion highlights that human drivers influence non-native tree presence, and that native phylogenetic and functional diversity have a critical role in the establishment and spread of subsequent invasions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystem; Human; Introduced Species; Phylogeny; Ecosystem; Humans; Introduced Species; Phylogeny","ecosystem; human; introduced species; phylogeny; Ecosystem; Humans; Introduced Species; Phylogeny","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the Bernina Foundation and DOB Ecology for financial support.

Pill identification, thus, is a crucial concern that needs to be investigated thoroughly. Recently, several attempts have been made to exploit deep learning to tackle the pill identification problem. However, most published works consider only single-pill identification and fail to distinguish hard samples with identical appearances. Also, most existing pill image datasets only feature single pill images captured in carefully controlled environments under ideal lighting conditions and clean backgrounds. In this work, we are the first to tackle the multi-pill detection problem in real-world settings, aiming at localizing and identifying pills captured by users during pill intake. Moreover, we also introduce a multi-pill image dataset taken in unconstrained conditions. To handle hard samples, we propose a novel method for constructing heterogeneous a priori graphs incorporating three forms of inter-pill relationships, including co-occurrence likelihood, relative size, and visual semantic correlation. We then offer a framework for integrating a priori with pills’ visual features to enhance detection accuracy. Our experimental results have proved the robustness, reliability, and explainability of the proposed framework. Experimentally, it outperforms all detection benchmarks in terms of all evaluation metrics. Specifically, our proposed framework improves COCO mAP metrics by 9.4% over Faster R-CNN and 12.0% compared to vanilla YOLOv5. Our study opens up new opportunities for protecting patients from medication errors using an AI-based pill identification solution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Controlled Study; Human; Illumination; Medication Error; Nonhuman; Pill; Reliability; Vanilla; Artificial Neural Network; Benchmarking; Microclimate; Reproducibility; Benchmarking; Environment, Controlled; Humans; Lighting; Neural Networks, Computer; Reproducibility Of Results","adult; article; controlled study; human; illumination; medication error; nonhuman; pill; reliability; Vanilla; artificial neural network; benchmarking; microclimate; reproducibility; Benchmarking; Environment, Controlled; Humans; Lighting; Neural Networks, Computer; Reproducibility of Results","","","Funding: This work was funded by Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup JSC),Vingroup, and supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under project code VINIF.2021.DA00128.","World Patient Safety Day 2022; 2016 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop Aipr, (2016); undefined, (2022); Wong, David Chi Wai, Quantitative metrics for evaluating the phased roll-out of clinical information systems, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 105, pp. 130-135, (2017); Usuyama, Naoto, EPillID dataset: A low-shot fine-grained benchmark for pill identification, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2020-June, pp. 3971-3977, (2020); Ling, Suiyi, Few-shot pill recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 9786-9795, (2020); Kwon, Hyuk-ju, Pill detection model for medicine inspection based on deep learning, Chemosensors, 10, 1, (2022); Daud Khan, Sultan Daud, A Unified Deep Learning Framework of Multi-scale Detectors for Geo-spatial Object Detection in High-Resolution Satellite Images, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 47, 8, pp. 9489-9504, (2022); Daud Khan, Sultan Daud, Multi-scale person localization with multi-stage deep sequential framework, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 14, 1, pp. 1217-1228, (2021); Chang, Wangjung, MedGlasses: A wearable smart-glasses-based drug pill recognition system using deep learning for visually impaired chronic patients, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 17013-17024, (2020)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","37768910","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172826965"

Urodeles provide ideal examples for exploring these dynamics over time and across space. In this study, we integrated a phylogeographic approach and ensemble species distribution modeling (eSDM) to infer the historical demography and distribution patterns of the Vietnam warty newt, Paramesotriton deloustali. Mitochondrial data revealed two groups, West and East, which diverged approximately 1.92 million years ago (Mya). Diversification was likely driven by change in the climate during early stages of the Pleistocene, with increasing monsoon and drought intensities. Biogeographic analysis indicated that the newt’s current distribution formed as a result of vicariance events. In addition, the two groups occupy distinct ecological niches. Demographic reconstruction showed signs of expansion in the effective population sizes of the two major groups beginning around 0.11 and 0.15 Mya, respectively. However, eSDM showed fluctuating predicted distributions during the last interglacial, last glacial maximum, mid-Holocene, and present. Mountain systems in northern Vietnam are likely to have served as climatic refuges and to have played a crucial role in safeguarding species from the effects of climate change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Climate Change; Demography; Drought; Ecological Niche; Effective Population Size; Holocene; Human; Interglacial; Last Glacial Maximum; Mountain Ranges; Nonhuman; Pleistocene; Salamandridae; Species Distribution; Vicariance; Viet Nam; Animal; Ecosystem; Papilloma; Wart; Animals; Demography; Ecosystem; Papilloma; Vietnam; Warts","article; climate change; demography; drought; ecological niche; effective population size; Holocene; human; interglacial; last glacial maximum; mountain ranges; nonhuman; Pleistocene; Salamandridae; species distribution; vicariance; Viet Nam; animal; ecosystem; papilloma; wart; Animals; Demography; Ecosystem; Papilloma; Vietnam; Warts","","","Funding text 1: This research has been supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to DVT (No.: 202223290), the Rufford Foundation (Project: 31908-2).

Accurately predicting the BIPV-harvested annual output energy (E<inf>out,annual</inf>) is crucial for evaluating the BIPV performance. Machine learning (ML) is a potential candidate for solving such a problem without the time-consuming process of experimental investigations. This contribution proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the E<inf>out,annual</inf> of 4-terminal perovskite/silicon (psk/Si) PV cells under realistic environmental conditions. The input variables of the proposed model consist of the input solar irradiance (P<inf>in</inf>), incident light's angle (A<inf>in</inf>), the PV module's temperature (T<inf>mod</inf>), the psk absorber's thickness (Th<inf>psk</inf>), and the psk absorber's bandgap (B<inf>psk</inf>). The input data were received from the simulated results. This work also evaluates the degree of importance of each input variable and optimizes the architecture of the ANN using the surrogate algorithm before predictions. The optimized ANN-3 (three hidden layers) model shows superior performance indicators, including a mean squared error of MSE = 0.02283, correlation coefficient R = 0.99999, and Willmott's index of agreement I<inf>w</inf> = 0.99999. Consequently, the predicted highest E<inf>out,annual</inf> at B<inf>psk</inf> of 1.71 eV is 297.73, 115.01, 193.98, and 97.6 kWh/m2 for the rooftop, east, south, and west facades, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atlas Simulation; Building Integrated Photovoltaic; Machine Learning; Photovoltaic; Surrogate Algorithm; Tandem Pv Cell","","","","This work is supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan.","Martin-Chivelet, Nuria, Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) products and systems: A review of energy-related behavior, Energy and Buildings, 262, (2022); Karthick, Alagar, Investigation of a binary eutectic mixture of phase change material for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 207, (2020); Roy, Anurag, Perovskite solar cells for bipv application: A review, Buildings, 10, 7, pp. 1-33, (2020); Benemann, Joachim, Building-integrated PV modules, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 67, 1-4, pp. 345-354, (2001); Defaix, P.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between mental health conditions and FGIDs among Vietnamese new-entry medical students. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in February 2022 among new-entry medical students in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. A printed questionnaire was distributed to all students on the day of freshmen health screening. Their urine samples were collected to screen for Helicobacter pylori infection using rapid urinary test. FGIDs were diagnosed using ROME IV criteria. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was defined as the presence of typical reflux symptoms at least twice a week. Mental health conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), were identified using Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scales, respectively. Results Among 400 new-entry medical students who participated in the study, the overall prevalence of FGIDs was 10.3% (functional dyspepsia 6.5%, irritable bowel disease 5.5%). The overlap syndrome (OS) of GERD-FGIDs or different FGIDs was present in 3.0% of participants. The prevalences of GAD and MDD were 6.8% and 10.2%, respectively. The urinary test was positive in 180 (45.0%) participants. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, MDD was significantly associated with not only the risk of FGIDs (OR = 5.599, 95%CI: 2.173–14.430, p<0.001) but also the risk of OS (OR = 10.076, 95CI%: 2.243–45.266, p = 0.003). Conclusions MDD is associated with FGIDs and OS among new-entry medical students. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Rapirun H.

(E)-cinnamaldehyde and 1,8 cineole have been identified as their major secondary metabolites, and are also generally considered as the main active ingredients responsible for their medicinal applications. However, ethnobotanical doctors still prefer to use whole essentials oils over purified compounds in bacterial infections. We therefore hypothesized that multi-compound extracts might exert better effects than isolated ingredients. In order to verify the hypothesis about advantages of whole materials, we examined antibacterial properties of the 2 plant essential oils in the comparison with their isolated major compounds, such as (E)-cinnamaldehyde and 1,8 cineole. Effects of liquid- and vapor-phase were examined on a set of 6 gram-positive and -negative bacteria, applying broth dilution, agar well diffusion and disc volatilization methods. In all 3 investigations, we observed that whole cinnamon and eucalyptus oils, with the lower concentrations of (E)-cinnamaldehyde (89.1%) and 1,8 cineole (61.2%), were able to induce better effects than the purified active compounds (≥ 99%). These results partly explain the advantages of using whole essential oils over isolated ingredients, and therefore support the application of traditional dosage forms for bacterial infections in ethnomedicine. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cineole; Cinnamaldehyde; Anti-bacterial Agents; Cinnamaldehyde; Eucalyptol; Oils, Volatile; Plant Oils; Essential Oil; Antiinfective Agent; Cineole; Cinnamaldehyde; Vegetable Oil; Agar Diffusion; Antibacterial Activity; Article; Bacterial Infection; Broth Dilution; Cinnamomum Cassia; Drug Isolation; Drug Screening; Eucalyptus Globulus; Nonhuman; Bark; Eucalyptus; Microbial Sensitivity Test; Plant Leaf; Anti-bacterial Agents; Cinnamomum Aromaticum; Eucalyptol; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Oils, Volatile; Plant Bark; Plant Leaves; Plant Oils","essential oil; antiinfective agent; cineole; cinnamaldehyde; vegetable oil; agar diffusion; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial infection; broth dilution; Cinnamomum cassia; drug isolation; drug screening; Eucalyptus globulus; nonhuman; bark; Eucalyptus; microbial sensitivity test; plant leaf; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cinnamomum aromaticum; Eucalyptol; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Oils, Volatile; Plant Bark; Plant Leaves; Plant Oils","","cineole, 470-82-6, 55962-72-6; cinnamaldehyde, 104-55-2; Anti-Bacterial Agents; cinnamaldehyde; Eucalyptol; Oils, Volatile; Plant Oils","","Common Medicinal Plants and Traditional Therapies in Vietnam, (2015); Williamson, Elizabeth Mary, Synergy and other interactions in phytomedicines, Phytomedicine, 8, 5, pp. 401-409, (2001); Adianti, Myrna, Anti-hepatitis C virus compounds obtained from Glycyrrhiza uralensis and other Glycyrrhiza species, Microbiology and Immunology, 58, 3, pp. 180-187, (2014); Nguyen, Ha Thi Thanh, Pharmacological characteristics of Artemisia vulgaris L. in isolated porcine basilar artery, Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 182, pp. 16-26, (2016); Huang, D.

To assess DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) graduation exams, this study analyzed their 2021 implementation in comparison to onsite exams conducted in 2020 and 2022 at the Faculty of Odonto-Stomatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam (FOS-UMPH). The final online examination comprises two main sessions: a synchronous online examination using FOS-UMPH e-Learning for theories (consisting of 200 MCQs and 3 written tests with 3 clinical situations needed be solved) and a synchronous online examination using Microsoft Teams for practicum (comprising of 12 online OSCE stations). The final grades were evaluated using the same metrics in face-toface final examinations in 2022 and 2020. A total of 114, 112 and 95 students were recruited for the first-time exams in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In order to analyze the reliability, histogram and k-mean clustering were employed. The histograms from 2020, 2021 and 2022 showed a striking similarity. However, fewer students failed in 2021 and 2022 (13% and 12.6%, respectively) compared to 2020 (28%), with clinical problem-solving part grades (belonging to theory session) being notably higher in 2021 and 2022. Intriguingly, the MCQ Score results showed the identical patterns. The courses of orthodontics, dental public health, and pediatrics subjects (in the group of prevention and development dentistry) stood out for their exceptional accuracy across both sessions. After examining data gathered over three years, we identified three distinct clusters: the first comprised of scattered average and low scores, the second characterized by high scores but unstable and scattered and the third cluster boasting consistently high and centered scores. According to our study, online and onsite traditional graduation exam results are relatively equivalent, but additional measures are necessary to standardize the final examination and adapt to the new normal trend in dental education. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Dental Examination; Dental Health; Dental Student; E-learning; Human; Medical Examination; National Lockdown; Preventive Dentistry; Problem Solving; Reliability; School Closure; Student Attitude; Viet Nam; Benchmarking; Child; Cluster Analysis; Communicable Disease Control; Reproducibility; Benchmarking; Child; Cluster Analysis; Communicable Disease Control; Covid-19; Humans; Reproducibility Of Results","Article; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dental examination; dental health; dental student; e-learning; human; medical examination; national lockdown; preventive dentistry; problem solving; reliability; school closure; student attitude; Viet Nam; benchmarking; child; cluster analysis; communicable disease control; reproducibility; Benchmarking; Child; Cluster Analysis; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Reproducibility of Results","","","","O'Doherty, Diane, Barriers and solutions to online learning in medical education - An integrative review, BMC Medical Education, 18, 1, (2018); Nijakowski, Kacper, The effectiveness of the blended learning in conservative dentistry with endodontics on the basis of the survey among 4th-year students during the covid-19 pandemic, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 9, (2021); Barabari, Poyan, Novel coronavirus (covid-19) and dentistry–a comprehensive review of literature, Dentistry Journal, 8, 2, (2020); International Journal of Business Management Economic Research, (2018); Timmis, Sue, Rethinking assessment in a digital age: opportunities, challenges and risks, British Educational Research Journal, 42, 3, pp. 454-476, (2016); Durning, Steven J., Comparing open-book and closed-book examinations: A systematic review, Academic Medicine, 91, 4, pp. 583-599, (2016); BMJ, (2012); Applied Statistics, (1979); Doan, Linhphuong, The COVID-19 endemic in Vietnam: Contextual considerations and implications, Frontiers in Public Health, 11, (2023); Hong, Sumin, Effects of a blended design of closed-book and open-book examinations on dental students’ anxiety and performance, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","37224149","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160122811"

However, it remains unclear how paleoclimate shapes spatial variation in biodiversity. Here, we assessed the influence of Quaternary climate change on spatial dissimilarity in taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional composition among neighboring 200-kilometer cells (beta-diversity) for angiosperm trees worldwide. We found that larger glacial-interglacial temperature change was strongly associated with lower spatial turnover (species replacements) and higher nestedness (richness changes) components of beta-diversity across all three biodiversity facets. Moreover, phylogenetic and functional turnover was lower and nestedness higher than random expectations based on taxonomic beta-diversity in regions that experienced large temperature change, reflecting phylogenetically and functionally selective processes in species replacement, extinction, and colonization during glacial-interglacial oscillations. Our results suggest that future human-driven climate change could cause local homogenization and reduction in taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of angiosperm trees worldwide. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Earth (planet); Glacial Geology; Phylogenetic; Beta Diversities; Future Climate; Geological Time; Nestedness; Paleoclimates; Phylogenetics; Quaternary Climate; Spatial Variations; Taxonomic Composition; Temperature Changes; Climate Change; Angiosperm; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Human; Phylogeny; Climate Change; Humans; Magnoliopsida; Phylogeny","Biodiversity; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Phylogenetic; Beta diversities; Future climate; Geological time; Nestedness; Paleoclimates; Phylogenetics; Quaternary climate; Spatial variations; Taxonomic composition; Temperature changes; Climate change; angiosperm; biodiversity; climate change; human; phylogeny; Climate Change; Humans; Magnoliopsida; Phylogeny","","","","Pecl, Gretta Tatyana, Biodiversity redistribution under climate change: Impacts on ecosystems and human well-being, Science, 355, 6332, (2017); Trisos, Christopher Harry, The projected timing of abrupt ecological disruption from climate change, Nature, 580, 7804, pp. 496-501, (2020); Brown, Stuart C., Persistent Quaternary climate refugia are hospices for biodiversity in the Anthropocene, Nature Climate Change, 10, 3, pp. 244-248, (2020); Fordham, Damien A., Using paleo-archives to safeguard biodiversity under climate change, Science, 369, 6507, (2020); Saladin, Bianca, Rapid climate change results in long-lasting spatial homogenization of phylogenetic diversity, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Svenning, Jens Christian, The Influence of Paleoclimate on Present-Day Patterns in Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 46, pp. 551-572, (2015); Hawkins, Bradford Alan, Energy, water, and broad-scale geographic patterns of species richness, Ecology, 84, 12, pp. 3105-3117, (2003); Currie, David J., Predictions and tests of climate-based hypotheses of broad-scale variation in taxonomic richness, Ecology Letters, 7, 12, pp. 1121-1134, (2004); Alahuhta, Janne, Current climate overrides historical effects on species richness and range size of freshwater plants in Europe and North America, Journal of Ecology, 108, 4, pp. 1262-1275, (2020); Testolin, Riccardo, Global patterns and drivers of alpine plant species richness, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 30, 6, pp. 1218-1231, (2021)","","American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","","","23752548","","","37018407","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151784770"

In addition to the precipitation and other meteorological time series, catchment characteristics, including soil data, land use, land cover, and roughness, are essential in most hydrologic models. The unavailability of these data series challenged the accuracy of simulations. However, recent advances in soft computing techniques offer better approaches and solutions at less computational complexity. These require a minimum amount of data, while they reach higher accuracies depending on the quality of data sets. The Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are two such systems that can be used in simulating river flows based on the catchment rainfall. In this paper, the computational capabilities of these two systems were tested in simulated river flows by developing the prediction models for Malwathu Oya in Sri Lanka. The simulated flows were then compared with the ground-measured river flows for accuracy. Correlation of coefficient (R), Per cent-Bias (bias), Nash Sutcliffe Model efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root mean square error (RMSE) were used as the comparative indices between Gradient Boosting Algorithms and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference Systems. Results of the study showcased that both systems can simulate river flows as a function of catchment rainfalls; however, the Cat gradient Boosting algorithm (CatBoost) has a computational edge over the Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The CatBoost algorithm outperformed other algorithms used in this study, with the best correlation score for the testing dataset having 0.9934. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Light gradient boosting (LightGBM), and Ensemble models scored 0.9283, 0.9253, and 0.9109, respectively. However, more applications should be investigated for sound conclusions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Water; Water; Rain; Water; Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System; Article; Case Study; Cat Gradient Boosting Algorithm; Catchment Area; Controlled Study; Correlation Coefficient; Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm; Flooding; Fuzzy System; Information Processing; Kling Gupta Efficiency; Learning Algorithm; Light Gradient Boosting Algorithm; Mean Absolute Relative Error; Measurement Accuracy; Nash Sutcliffe Model Efficiency; Percent Bias; Poverty; Prediction; Risk Factor; River Basin; Root Mean Squared Error; Rural Area; Scoring System; Simulation; Soft Computing Technique; Sri Lanka; Water Level; Water Management; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Environmental Monitoring; Fuzzy Logic; Procedures; Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Fuzzy Logic; Neural Networks, Computer; Water","rain; water; Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System; Article; case study; cat gradient boosting algorithm; catchment area; controlled study; correlation coefficient; extreme gradient boosting algorithm; flooding; fuzzy system; information processing; Kling Gupta Efficiency; learning algorithm; light gradient boosting algorithm; Mean Absolute Relative Error; measurement accuracy; Nash Sutcliffe Model efficiency; Percent Bias; poverty; prediction; risk factor; river basin; root mean squared error; rural area; scoring system; simulation; soft computing technique; Sri Lanka; water level; water management; algorithm; artificial neural network; environmental monitoring; fuzzy logic; procedures; Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Fuzzy Logic; Neural Networks, Computer; Water","","water, 7732-18-5; Water","The authors would like to thank Imiya Chathuranika (MEng in Water Engineering and Management), a Researcher at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology, Sri Lanka, for the support in generating the interactive map of the Malwathu River catchment.","Askman, Johan, Why People Live in Flood-Prone Areas in Akuressa, Sri Lanka, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 9, 2, pp. 143-156, (2018); Ghaedi, Hamed, Predicting flood damage using the flood peak ratio and Giovanni Flooded Fraction, PLOS ONE, 17, 8 August, (2022); Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides, (2017); Rangarajan, Govindan, A climate predictability index and its applications, Geophysical Research Letters, 24, 10, pp. 1239-1242, (1997); Global Climate Risk Index 2019 Who Suffers Most from Extreme Weather Events Weather Related Loss Events in 2017 and 1998 to 2017, (2018); Tkachenko, Nataliya, Predicting floods with flickr tags, PLOS ONE, 12, 2, (2017); da Silva Junior, Antonio Carlos, Multi-trait and multi-environment Bayesian analysis to predict the G x E interaction in flood-irrigated rice, PLOS ONE, 17, 5 May, (2022); Arthur, Rudy, Social sensing of floods in the UK, PLOS ONE, 13, 1, (2018); Leuchtenberger, Caroline, Territoriality of giant otter groups in an area with seasonal flooding, PLOS ONE, 10, 5, (2015); Rahmani, Farhang, Association between forecasting models’ precision and nonlinear patterns of daily river flow time series, Modeling Earth Systems and Environment, 8, 3, pp. 4267-4276, (2022)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","37099590","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153973353"

It is thus urgent to examine their perceptions of the potential risks, their coping strategies, and the factors influencing their adaptation decisions in agriculture production. By exploring adaptation measures of the Xo Dang and Co Tu EMFs in Quang Nam province, Central Vietnam, the study results reveal that the EMFs are increasingly conscious of local climate shocks in the recent decade; as a result, they have applied multiple specific strategies in agriculture production to mitigate risks. The findings indicate that the key variables of the age of the household head, income, household size, residence period at the locality, and farmers' perception of climate change significantly influenced the households’ adaptation decisions. Recognizing this, the study proposed specific recommendations and policy implications to minimize risks while maximizing benefits for the EMFs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation Decisions; Agriculture Production; Central Vietnam; Climate Change; Ethnic Minority Farmers (emfs)","","","","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by Hue University under the Core Research Program, Grant No. NCM.

Here we used data from 2,325 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight from 71 million participants, to report the height and body-mass index (BMI) of children and adolescents aged 5–19 years on the basis of rural and urban place of residence in 200 countries and territories from 1990 to 2020. In 1990, children and adolescents residing in cities were taller than their rural counterparts in all but a few high-income countries. By 2020, the urban height advantage became smaller in most countries, and in many high-income western countries it reversed into a small urban-based disadvantage. The exception was for boys in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in some countries in Oceania, south Asia and the region of central Asia, Middle East and north Africa. In these countries, successive cohorts of boys from rural places either did not gain height or possibly became shorter, and hence fell further behind their urban peers. The difference between the age-standardized mean BMI of children in urban and rural areas was <1.1 kg m–2 in the vast majority of countries. Within this small range, BMI increased slightly more in cities than in rural areas, except in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in central and eastern Europe. Our results show that in much of the world, the growth and developmental advantages of living in cities have diminished in the twenty-first century, whereas in much of sub-Saharan Africa they have amplified. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescence; Body Mass; Growth And Development; Rural Area; Twenty First Century; Urban Population; Adolescent; Adult; Africa South Of The Sahara; Article; Body Weight; Central Asia; Child; City; Controlled Study; Eastern Europe; High Income Country; Human; Human Experiment; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle East; North Africa; Pacific Islands; Preschool Child; Residence Characteristics; South Asia; Africa; Epidemiology; Growth, Development And Aging; Rural Population; Sub-saharan Africa; Adolescent; Africa South Of The Sahara; Africa, Northern; Body Mass Index; Child; Growth And Development; Humans; Male; Rural Population; Urban Population","adolescence; body mass; growth and development; rural area; twenty first century; urban population; adolescent; adult; Africa south of the Sahara; article; body weight; central Asia; child; city; controlled study; Eastern Europe; high income country; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; Middle East; North Africa; Pacific islands; preschool child; residence characteristics; South Asia; Africa; epidemiology; growth, development and aging; rural population; Sub-Saharan Africa; Adolescent; Africa South of the Sahara; Africa, Northern; Body Mass Index; Child; Growth and Development; Humans; Male; Rural Population; Urban Population","","","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the UK Medical Research Council (grant number MR/V034057/1), the Wellcome Trust (Pathways to Equitable Healthy Cities grant 209376/Z/17/Z), the AstraZeneca Young Health Programme and the European Commission (STOP project through EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement 774548).

Given that broader literature on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) suggests a strong positive association between ACEs and cardiometabolic risk or diseases, we hypothesized that parental absence during childhood, which is a major component of ACEs, is more likely to cause MetS in adulthood. Methods Data were obtained from the baseline survey of the Khanh Hoa Cardiovascular Study, in which 3000 residents aged between 40 to 60 years participated. MetS was assessed using the modified Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. It was considered parental absence if the participants had experienced parental absence due to death, divorce, or out-migration before three or between three to 15 years. We used multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the association between parental absence during childhood and metabolic syndrome during adulthood. Results There was no significant association between parental absence and MetS; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76–1.22) for those who experienced parental absence between three to 15 years and the corresponding figure for those who experienced it before three years was 0.93 (95% CI = 0.72–1.20). No significant associations were observed when these were examined for the causes of parental absence.

The mortality rate due to acute diarrhea among U5 children accounted for 11% in Lao PDR in 2016. No study has been done to investigate the etiologic pathogens of acute diarrhea and the risk factors associated with dehydration status among U5 children hospitalized with acute diarrhea in this region. Objectives The study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, etiological agents and associated factors of dehydration status of acute diarrhea among hospitalized U5 children in Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR. Methods This retrospective study reviewed paper-based medical records with available stool examination results of 33 U5 children hospitalized with acute diarrhea in Savannakhet Provincial Hospital, Lao PDR between Jan. 2018 and Dec. 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to describe clinical characteristics and etiologic agents of acute diarrhea of the children. Nonparametric test, Pearson’s Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to determine the risk factors associated with level of dehydration of the participants. Results Vomiting was the most common symptom (66.6%), followed by fever (60.6%). Dehydration was found in 48.4% of subjects. Rotavirus was the most common identified pathogen with a prevalence of 55.5%. Bacterial enteric infection was identified in 15.1% of patients. There is a significantly higher prevalence of dehydration among children with acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus compared to those with negative rotavirus testing (70.0% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.02). Conclusions Rotavirus was the most prevalent pathogen of acute diarrhea among U5 children. Pediatric patients with acute diarrhea caused by rotavirus had a higher prevalence of dehydration compared to those with negative rotavirus testing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amoxicillin; Ceftriaxone; Amoxicillin; Ceftriaxone; Oral Rehydration Solution; Acute Diarrhea; Aeromonas; Article; Bacterial Infection; Bloody Diarrhea; Campylobacter; Chi Square Test; Child; Cholera; Clinical Feature; Dehydration; Disease Association; Escherichia Coli; Feces Analysis; Female; Fever; Fisher Exact Test; Hospital Patient; Hospitalization; Human; Infant; Infectious Agent; Intestine Infection; Major Clinical Study; Male; Medical Record; Mortality Rate; Newborn; Nonhuman; Nonparametric Test; Observational Study; Plesiomonas Shigelloides; Preschool Child; Prevalence; Retrospective Study; Risk Factor; Rotavirus; Salmonella; Septicemia; Shigella; Thailand; Vibrio Cholerae; Vibrio Parahaemolyticus; Animal; Complication; Diarrhea; Laos; Mustelidae; Animals; Child; Dehydration; Diarrhea; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors","amoxicillin; ceftriaxone; oral rehydration solution; acute diarrhea; Aeromonas; Article; bacterial infection; bloody diarrhea; Campylobacter; chi square test; child; cholera; clinical feature; dehydration; disease association; Escherichia coli; feces analysis; female; fever; Fisher exact test; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; infant; infectious agent; intestine infection; major clinical study; male; medical record; mortality rate; newborn; nonhuman; nonparametric test; observational study; Plesiomonas shigelloides; preschool child; prevalence; retrospective study; risk factor; Rotavirus; Salmonella; septicemia; Shigella; Thailand; Vibrio cholerae; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; animal; complication; diarrhea; Laos; Mustelidae; Animals; Child; Dehydration; Diarrhea; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors","","amoxicillin, 26787-78-0, 34642-77-8, 61336-70-7; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1, 104376-79-6","The authors would like to thank all staff at Savannakhet Provincial Hospital and NCLE for helping during data collection for this study.","World Health Organization, (2018); Liu, Li, Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: An updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000, The Lancet, 379, 9832, pp. 2151-2161, (2012); Natchu, Uma Chandra Mouli, Diarrhoea in children: Identifying the cause and burden, The Lancet, 382, 9888, pp. 184-186, (2013); Under Five Deaths Data by Country, (2019); Estimates of Child Cause of Dealth Diarrhea, (2018); Houatthongkham, Souphatsone, Trends in the incidence of acute watery diarrhoea in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2009-2013, Western Pacific Surveillance and Response Journal : WPSAR, 7, 3, pp. 6-14, (2016); Savannakhet Provincial Hospital Statistics Report, (2019); Updates for the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Imci, (2017); Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children Guidelines for the Management of Common Illnesses with Limited Resources, (2005); Fischer-Walker, Christa L., Global burden of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea, The Lancet, 381, 9875, pp. 1405-1416, (2013)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","36862680","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149282029"

In this study, an interview survey was conducted to evaluate the infection risk from the current water supply in rural areas in Kenya. According to the interview, the residents living in areas with no public water supply drink water from various sources such as surface water, spring water, dug well, rainwater, tap water, and water sold by nearby non-governmental organizations. Further, most of the respondents usually drink unpurified water, which generated a high infection risk value of 0.77 owing to inadequate water storage management. A new self-sustaining water purification process, which is a combination of a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor kind of biological trickling filter and a slow sand filter (SSF) with a 500 W solar was installed in an area with no public electricity and water supply. The DHS-SSF system efficiently decreased the total organic carbon, color, and turbidity by over 80% after the two-week operation, and the treated water could be used for household water. In addition, a survey for infection risk evaluation was conducted to determine the utility of the DHS-SSF system. However, drinking water supplied by the DHS-SSF system could reduce the infection risk of diarrhea by up to 99.5%. This result indicates that the DHS-SSF system could be an appropriate water purification system in no public water supply area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drinking Water; Infection Risk; Sustainable; Water Supply System; Waterborne Infection Disease","","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported from the Global Pro-Active Root Technology Program (WISE) and Japan Society of Promotion and Science (JSPS).; Funding text 2: We thank to Terumi Matsushita and Moyo Children Care Center (Thika, Kenya) for supporting the survey and operating the DHS-STF system in Kenya.","undefined; Batabyal, Prasenjit, Diarrheogenic Escherechia coli in potable water sources of West Bengal, India, Acta Tropica, 127, 3, pp. 153-157, (2013); undefined; Chowdhury, Shakhawat H., Heavy metals in drinking water: Occurrences, implications, and future needs in developing countries, Science of the Total Environment, 569-570, pp. 476-488, (2016); DeWilde, Carol Kolb, An integrated method for evaluating community-based safe water programmes and an application in rural Mexico, Health Policy and Planning, 23, 6, pp. 452-464, (2008); Research Journal of Environmental and Earth Sciences, (2013); Journal of Applied Sciences and Environmental Management, (2011); Hatamoto, M., Characterization of downflow hanging sponge reactors with regard to structure, process function, and microbial community compositions, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 102, 24, pp. 10345-10352, (2018); Islam, M.

The multi-level system oscillation is generated by the wave-particle behaviors of AC driven along the microstrip ring circular path. The continuous successive filtering is applied via the device input port. The higher-order harmonic oscillations can be filtered, from which the two-level system known as a Rabi oscillation is achieved. The outside microstrip ring energy is coupled to the inside rings, from which the multiband Rabi oscillations can be formed within the inner rings. The resonant Rabi frequencies can be applied for multi-sensing probes. The relationship between electron density and Rabi oscillation frequency of each microstrip ring output can be obtained and used for multi-sensing probe applications. The relativistic sensing probe can be obtained by the warp speed electron distribution at the resonant Rabi frequency respecting the resonant ring radii. These are available for relativistic sensing probe usage. The obtained experimental results have shown that there are 3-center Rabi frequencies obtained, which can be used for 3-sensing probes simultaneously. The sensing probe speeds of 1.1c, 1.4c, and 1.5c are obtained using the microstrip ring radii of 14.20, 20.12, and 34.49 mm, respectively. The best sensor sensitivity of 1.30 ms is achieved.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors, including phlorizin, exert nephroprotective effects in patients with chronic kidney disease, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. A HFD or standard diet was fed to adult C57BL/6J male mice, and phlorizin was administered. Lamellar body components of the proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) were investigated. After phlorizin administration in HFD-fed mice, sphingomyelin and ceramide in urine and tissues were assessed and label-free quantitative proteomics was performed using kidney tissue samples. Mitochondrial elongation by fusion was effective in the PTECs of HFD-fed obese mice under phlorizin administration, and many lamellar bodies were found in the apical portion of the S2 segment of the proximal tubule. Phlorizin functioned as a diuretic, releasing lamellar bodies from the apical membrane of PTECs and clearing the obstruction in nephrons. The main component of the lamellar bodies was sphingomyelin. On the first day of phlorizin administration in HFD-fed obese mice, the diuretic effect was increased, and more sphingomyelin was excreted through urine than in vehicle-treated mice. The expressions of three peroxisomal β-oxidation proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism were downregulated after phlorizin administration in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Fatty acid elongation protein levels increased with phlorizin administration, indicating an increase in long-chain fatty acids. Lamellar bodies accumulated in the proximal renal tubule of the S2 segment of the HFD-fed mice, indicating that the urinary excretion of lamellar bodies has nephroprotective effects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Pentobarbital; Phlorizin; Sphingomyelin; Glucose; Sodium; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Phlorhizin; Sodium; Sphingomyelins; Symporters; Beta Oxidation Protein; Ceramide; Diuretic Agent; Fatty Acid Elongation Protein; Long Chain Fatty Acid; Nephroprotective Effect; Pentobarbital; Phlorizin; Protein Derivative; Regulator Protein; Sphingomyelin; Unclassified Drug; Cotransporter; Fatty Acid; Glucose; Sodium; Adult; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Apical Membrane; Article; C57bl 6 Mouse; Controlled Study; Diet-induced Obesity; Diuresis; Down Regulation; Fatty Acid Metabolism; Kidney Tissue; Kidney Tubule Acidosis; Kidney Tubule Damage; Lamellar Body; Male; Mitochondrion; Mouse; Nephron; Nonhuman; Protein Expression; Protein Function; Proteomics; Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cell; Proximal Tubule Cell; Tissues; Urinary Excretion; Urine; Adverse Event; Animal; C57bl Mouse; Lipid Diet; Mouse Mutant; Animals; Diet, High-fat; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57bl; Mice, Obese; Phlorhizin; Sodium; Sphingomyelins; Symporters","beta oxidation protein; ceramide; diuretic agent; fatty acid elongation protein; long chain fatty acid; nephroprotective effect; pentobarbital; phlorizin; protein derivative; regulator protein; sphingomyelin; unclassified drug; cotransporter; fatty acid; glucose; sodium; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apical membrane; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; controlled study; diet-induced obesity; diuresis; down regulation; fatty acid metabolism; kidney tissue; kidney tubule acidosis; kidney tubule damage; lamellar body; male; mitochondrion; mouse; nephron; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; proteomics; proximal tubular epithelial cell; proximal tubule cell; tissues; urinary excretion; urine; adverse event; animal; C57BL mouse; lipid diet; mouse mutant; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Phlorhizin; Sodium; Sphingomyelins; Symporters","","pentobarbital, 57-33-0, 76-74-4; phlorizin, 60-81-1, 7061-54-3; sphingomyelin, 85187-10-6; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3; sodium, 7440-23-5; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Phlorhizin; Sodium; Sphingomyelins; Symporters","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant numbers 25870281, 16K08439] and the Cooperative Study Program (to S.

Understanding mortality risk factors is crucial for the clinical management of severe COVID-19. Methods We conducted a retrospective study at an intensive care center in Ho Chi Minh City that urgently built by Bach Mai Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam, when the Delta variant predominated. Participants were laboratory-confirmed patients with SARSCoV- 2 infection, admitted in August 2021. Data on patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, radiographic and laboratory findings, treatment, and clinical time course were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Risk factors to mortality were assessed using logistic regression. Results Among 504 eligible COVID-19 patients, case fatality was 52.2%. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 61.2% of non-survivors and 43.6% of survivors (p < 0.001). The time from onset to hospital admission was 8 days in non-survivors and 7 days in survivors (p = 0.004). Among non-survivors, 90.2% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygen therapy was administered for all patients, but antiviral agent was given to 51.7% of nonsurvivors. 54.2% of non-survivors tested positive for the bacterial infection using blood culture. The risk factors for mortality were diabetes mellitus, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, vaccination status, time from onset to admission, and older age. Conclusions Critical patients with COVID-19 owing to the Delta variant in Vietnam had delayed hospital admission, leading to ARDS and death. Early availability of vaccines and preventing bacterial infections are crucial for reducing mortality of COVID-19, especially in low- and middleincome countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dexamethasone; Remdesivir; Dexamethasone; Remdesivir; Abnormal Laboratory Result; Adult; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Aged; Aging; Article; Blood Culture; Breathing Rate; Clinical Feature; Clinical Outcome; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Critically Ill Patient; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Severity; Drug Bioavailability; Female; Health Center; Hospital Admission; Human; Laboratory Diagnosis; Logistic Regression Analysis; Low Income Country; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Income Country; Mortality Risk; Nonhuman; Observational Study; Oxygen Saturation; Oxygen Therapy; Pandemic; Radiography; Retrospective Study; Risk Factor; Risk Reduction; Sars-cov-2 (variant B.1.617.2/delta/india/mutant D614g, P681r); Survivor; Therapy Delay; Time To Treatment; Vaccination; Very Elderly; Viet Nam; Young Adult; Critical Illness; Epidemiology; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Covid-19; Critical Illness; Humans; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Retrospective Studies; Sars-cov-2; Vietnam","dexamethasone; remdesivir; abnormal laboratory result; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; aging; Article; blood culture; breathing rate; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; drug bioavailability; female; health center; hospital admission; human; laboratory diagnosis; logistic regression analysis; low income country; major clinical study; male; middle income country; mortality risk; nonhuman; observational study; oxygen saturation; oxygen therapy; pandemic; radiography; retrospective study; risk factor; risk reduction; SARS-CoV-2 (variant B.1.617.2/Delta/India/mutant D614G, P681R); survivor; therapy delay; time to treatment; vaccination; very elderly; Viet Nam; young adult; critical illness; epidemiology; respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; Critical Illness; Humans; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Vietnam","","dexamethasone, 50-02-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3","Funding:ThisworkwassupportedbytheToyota FoundationInitiativeprogram,TheJapanSociety ofthePromotionofScience(JSPS),aGrant-in-Aid forScientificResearch(KAKENHI,Promotionof JointInternationalResearchB,#20KK0218),anda grantfromJapanScienceandTechnology(JST), JST-MiraiProgram(#20345310).Initialsofthe","Weekly Epidemiological Update on Covid 19 12 October 2022; Manabe, Toshie, Spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 during the first 7 months of the epidemic in Vietnam, BMC Infectious Diseases, 21, 1, (2021); Coronavirus Disease Covid 19 Pandemic; Rosato, Adriana E., Rapid detection of the widely circulating B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 variant, Pathology, 54, 3, pp. 351-356, (2022); Del Rio, Carlos D., Confronting the Delta Variant of SARS-CoV-2, Summer 2021, JAMA, 326, 11, pp. 1001-1002, (2021); Coleman, Kristen K., Viral Load of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Respiratory Aerosols Emitted by Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) While Breathing, Talking, and Singing, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 74, 10, pp. 1722-1728, (2022); Butt, Adeel Ajwad, Severity of Illness in Persons Infected With the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant vs Beta Variant in Qatar, JAMA Internal Medicine, 182, 2, pp. 197-205, (2022); Nguyen, The Phuong, Rapid impact assessments of COVID-19 control measures against the Delta variant and short-term projections of new confirmed cases in Vietnam, Journal of Global Health, 11, (2021); Lauring, Adam S., Variants of SARS-CoV-2, JAMA, 326, 9, (2021); Asian Pacific Journal of Disease Management, (2010)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","36662716","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146642240"

We attempted to evaluate the incidence, distribution, and risk factors associated with death after applying the social distance strategy to the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the Danang outbreak in Vietnam. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the online the Danang Hospital reports, gathering the epidemiological history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. We then conducted a descriptive analysis of Fisher's Phi Coefficient and Cramer's, along with multiple logistic regression models to test the effects of symptomatology and control measures performed by Vietnamese government. The last report we examined on August 29, 2020. Results: A total of 389 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases were related to the Danang outbreak are included in our analysis with a mean age of 47.1 (SD = 18.4), involving 154 men and 235 women, with 34 cases of death and 355 were alive. The study showed significant results related to age, quarantine measures, previous negative SARS-CoV-2 test, and a range of symptoms, including shortness of breath and myalgia (p-value <0.05). Our multiple-variable analysis suggested the significant risk of death was related to age, severe symptomology, undetected SARS-CoV-2 test results, and prior quarantined SARS-CoV-2 history. Conclusions: Vietnamese authorities had implemented successful quarantine practices to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. However, this virus has shown dynamic spread beyond the ability of the country to control its transmission. Adequate screening, social distancing, and adequate care of elderly and healthcare workers can lower the risk of future outbreaks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Death; Epidemiology; Nosocomial; Outbreak; Sars-cov-2; Transmission","","","","We thank the Steering Committee for Prevention and Control Covid-19 Pandemic Unit in Danang City for providing the data in our study.","Coronavirus Disease Covid 19 Weekly Epidemiological Update and Weekly Operational Update, (2020); Yelin, Dana, Long-term consequences of COVID-19: research needs, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 20, 10, pp. 1115-1117, (2020); Liu, Ying, The reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher compared to SARS coronavirus, Journal of Travel Medicine, 27, 2, (2020); Lu, Hongzhou, Outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China: The mystery and the miracle, Journal of Medical Virology, 92, 4, pp. 401-402, (2020); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2020); Mulligan, Mark J., Phase I/II study of COVID-19 RNA vaccine BNT162b1 in adults, Nature, 586, 7830, pp. 589-593, (2020); Medrxiv, (2025)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","24058440","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146316467"

Control of this important vector highly relies on the use of insecticides, especially pyrethroids. The high frequency (>78%) of the L982W substitution was detected at the target site of the pyrethroid insecticide, the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) of A. aegypti collected from Vietnam and Cambodia. Alleles having concomitant mutations L982W + F1534C and V1016G + F1534C were also confirmed in both countries, and their frequency was high (>90%) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Strains having these alleles exhibited substantially higher levels of pyrethroid resistance than any other field population ever reported. The L982W substitution has never been detected in any country of the Indochina Peninsula except Vietnam and Cambodia, but it may be spreading to other areas of Asia, which can cause an unprecedentedly serious threat to the control of dengue fever as well as other Aedes-borne infectious diseases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Insecticides; Pyrethrins; Disease Control; Diseases; Genes; Aedes Aegypti; Cambodia; High Frequency Hf; Infectious Disease; Mosquito Vectors; Pyrethroid Insecticide; Pyrethroids; Sodium Channel; Target Sites; Viet Nam; Insecticides; Insecticide; Pyrethroid; Aedes; Animal; Asia; Communicable Disease; Dengue; Genetics; Insecticide Resistance; Mutation; Animals; Communicable Diseases; Dengue; Insecticide Resistance; Mutation; Pyrethrins","Disease control; Diseases; Genes; Aedes aegypti; Cambodia; High frequency HF; Infectious disease; Mosquito vectors; Pyrethroid insecticide; Pyrethroids; Sodium channel; Target sites; Viet Nam; Insecticides; insecticide; pyrethroid; Aedes; animal; Asia; communicable disease; dengue; genetics; insecticide resistance; mutation; Animals; Communicable Diseases; Dengue; Insecticide Resistance; Mutation; Pyrethrins","","Insecticides; Pyrethrins","We thank T.

Epstein–Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) is differentially expressed during chondrogenic differentiation and can be produced by MSC. EBI3 is also a subunit of interleukin (IL)-27 and IL-35, and it accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when its partners, such as IL-27 p28 and IL-35 p35, are insufficient. ER stress induced by protein accumulation is responsible for chondrogenic differentiation. However, the role of EBI3 and its relevance to the ER stress in chondrogenic differentiation of MSC have never been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that EBI3 protein is expressed in the early stage of chondrogenic differentiation of MSC. Additionally, knockdown, overexpression, or induction of EBI3 through IL-1β inhibits chondrogenesis. We show that EBI3 localizes and accumulates in the ER of MSC after overexpression or induction by IL-1β and TNF-α, whereas ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbuty-ric acid decreases its accumulation in MSC. Moreover, EBI3 modulates ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α) after induced by IL-1β, and MSC-like cells coexpress EBI3 and IRE1α in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue. Altogether, these data demonstrate that intracellular EBI3 commits to chondrogenic differentiation by regulating ER stress sensor IRE1α. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ribonuclease; Endoribonucleases; Interleukins; Protein Serine-threonine Kinases; Biorevo Bz-x800; Epstein Barr Virus Antigen; Epstein Barr Virus Induced Gene 3; Interleukin 17; Interleukin 1beta; Protein Ire1; Small Interfering Rna; Transforming Growth Factor Beta1; Tumor Necrosis Factor; Unclassified Drug; Interleukin Derivative; Ribonuclease; Article; Cell Proliferation; Chondrocyte; Chondrogenesis; Clinical Article; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Endosome; Epstein Barr Virus; Gene Overexpression; Genetic Transfection; Histology; Human; Human Cell; Immunoblotting; Immunocytochemistry; Immunofluorescence; Immunohistochemistry; Immunoprecipitation; Mesenchymal Stem Cell; Osteoarthritis; Protein Expression; Protein Function; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Synovium; Western Blotting; Epstein Barr Virus Infection; Genetics; Metabolism; Chondrocytes; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Endoribonucleases; Epstein-barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Interleukins; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Protein Serine-threonine Kinases","Epstein Barr virus antigen; Epstein Barr virus induced gene 3; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; protein IRE1; small interfering RNA; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; interleukin derivative; ribonuclease; Article; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; chondrogenesis; clinical article; endoplasmic reticulum stress; endosome; Epstein Barr virus; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; histology; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunocytochemistry; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; mesenchymal stem cell; osteoarthritis; protein expression; protein function; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rheumatoid arthritis; synovium; Western blotting; Epstein Barr virus infection; genetics; metabolism; Chondrocytes; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Endoribonucleases; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Interleukins; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases","","ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; Endoribonucleases; Interleukins; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases","This work was supported in part by Grants-In-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (JSPS KAKENHI # 19K08925), and the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, through UOEH Grant for Advanced Research.

However, the structure–activity relationship study of flavones on the anti-dengue activity remains mostly limited to the natural-occuring analogs. Herein, 27 flavone analogs were successfully synthesized, of which 5 analogs (5e, 5h, 5o, 5q, and 5r) were novel. In total, 33 analogs bearing a diverse range of substituents were evaluated for their efficacy against DENV2-infected LLC/MK2 cells. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups on ring B such as Br (5m) or NO<inf>2</inf> (5n and 5q) enhanced the activity significantly. In particular, the tri-ester 5d and di-ester 5e exhibited low toxicity against normal cell, and exceptional DENV2 inhibition with the EC<inf>50</inf> as low as 70 and 68 nM, respectively, which is over 300-fold more active compared to the original baicalein reference. The viral targets for these potent flavone analogs were predicted to be NS5 MTase and NS5 RdRp, as suggested by the likelihood ratios from the molecular docking study. The great binding interaction energy of 8-bromobaicalein (5f) confirms the anti-dengue activity at atomistic level. The physicochemical property of all the synthetic flavone analogs in this study were predicted to be within the acceptable range. Moreover, the QSAR model showed the strong correlation between the anti-dengue activity and the selected molecular descriptors. This study emphasizes the great potential of flavone as a core structure for further development as a novel anti-dengue agent in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flavone; Esters; Flavone; Flavones; Ester; Flavone; Flavone Derivative; Chemistry; Molecular Docking; Structure Activity Relation; Esters; Flavones; Molecular Docking Simulation; Structure-activity Relationship","ester; flavone; flavone derivative; chemistry; molecular docking; structure activity relation; Esters; Flavones; Molecular Docking Simulation; Structure-Activity Relationship","","flavone, 525-82-6; Esters; flavone; Flavones","This work (Grant No. RGNS 64-008) was supported by Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (OPS MHESI), Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and Chulalongkorn University to T.K.; The Asahi Glass Foundation under CU-AGF grant 2022 to T.K.; Ratchadapiseksompotch Research fund, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (RA-MF 3/62, RA-MF 12/65, and RA64/018) to S.B.; the DPST scholarship from the Royal Thai Government (studentship to A.P.); and the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University (to T.K. and N.V.).

Floods and droughts triggered by El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) have been threatening sustenance in the MRD. Sustainable food supplies require understanding the response of the MRD hydrology to the changing ENSO behaviour in recent decades. Here, we reconstructed the annual rainfall maxima in the MRD using the oceanic paleoclimate proxy from coral skeletons and compared them with ENSO indexes. Annual minima of coral-based seawater oxygen isotope (δ18O<inf>sw</inf>) correlated with annual rainfall maxima, which allowed to extend rainfall data from 1924 to the recent. The annual rainfall maxima based on δ18O<inf>sw</inf> negatively correlated with the central Pacific El Niño index. This suggested that La Niña and central Pacific El Niño events lead to heavy and light rainy seasons. The heavy rainy season had more serious impacts in recent decades, which likely increases the flood risk. In contrast, the frequency and rainfall amount of the light rainy season has not changed significantly, although a catastrophic drought has hit the MRD. Our finding concludes that the impact of the ENSO event on MRD hydrology is inconsistent in the past century. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","El Nino; Hydrology; El Nino-southern Oscillation; Hydrology","El Nino; hydrology; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Hydrology","","","We thank CREES members at Hokkaido University for their assistance.

M., Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom","Despite substantial declines since 2000, lower respiratory infections (LRIs), diarrhoeal diseases, and malaria remain among the leading causes of nonfatal and fatal disease burden for children under 5 years of age (under 5), primarily in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The spatial burden of each of these diseases has been estimated subnationally across SSA, yet no prior analyses have examined the pattern of their combined burden. Here we synthesise subnational estimates of the burden of LRIs, diarrhoea, and malaria in children under-5 from 2000 to 2017 for 43 sub-Saharan countries. Some units faced a relatively equal burden from each of the three diseases, while others had one or two dominant sources of unit-level burden, with no consistent pattern geographically across the entire subcontinent. Using a subnational counterfactual analysis, we show that nearly 300 million DALYs could have been averted since 2000 by raising all units to their national average. Our findings are directly relevant for decision-makers in determining which and targeting where the most appropriate interventions are for increasing child survival. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child Health; Disability; Disease Prevalence; Malaria; Mortality; Africa South Of The Sahara; African; Article; Child; Child Health Care; Childhood Disease; Death; Democratic Republic Congo; Diarrhea; Disability-adjusted Life Year; Disease Burden; Ethiopia; Human; Lower Respiratory Tract Infection; Major Clinical Study; Morbidity; Mortality Rate; Niger; Nigeria; Risk Factor; Risk Reduction; Sierra Leone; Survival; Trend Study; Africa; Preschool Child; Sub-saharan Africa; Africa, Northern; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Sub-saharan African People","child health; disability; disease prevalence; malaria; mortality; Africa south of the Sahara; African; Article; child; child health care; childhood disease; death; Democratic Republic Congo; diarrhea; disability-adjusted life year; disease burden; Ethiopia; human; lower respiratory tract infection; major clinical study; morbidity; mortality rate; Niger; Nigeria; risk factor; risk reduction; Sierra Leone; survival; trend study; Africa; preschool child; Sub-Saharan Africa; Africa, Northern; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Sub-Saharan African People","","","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Understanding the emergence, evolution, and transmission of individual antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is essential to develop sustainable strategies combatting this threat. Here, we use metagenomic sequencing to analyse ARGs in 757 sewage samples from 243 cities in 101 countries, collected from 2016 to 2019. We find regional patterns in resistomes, and these differ between subsets corresponding to drug classes and are partly driven by taxonomic variation. The genetic environments of 49 common ARGs are highly diverse, with most common ARGs carried by multiple distinct genomic contexts globally and sometimes on plasmids. Analysis of flanking sequence revealed ARG-specific patterns of dispersal limitation and global transmission. Our data furthermore suggest certain geographies are more prone to transmission events and should receive additional attention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Sulfanilamide; Anti-bacterial Agents; Sewage; Sulfanilamide; Antiinfective Agent; Antibiotic Resistance; Dispersal; Drug; Sewage; Amphotropism; Antibiotic Resistome; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Microbiome; City; Disease Transmission; Genetic Background; Genome Analysis; Geography; Hierarchical Clustering; Human; Macrolide Resistance; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Nonhuman; Paired End Sequencing; Plasmid; Seasonal Variation; Small Ribosomal Subunit; Species Diversity; Synteny; Urban Area; Genetics; Genomics; Anti-bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genomics; Metagenome; Sewage","sulfanilamide; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; dispersal; drug; sewage; amphotropism; antibiotic resistome; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial microbiome; city; disease transmission; genetic background; genome analysis; geography; hierarchical clustering; human; macrolide resistance; metagenome; metagenomics; nonhuman; paired end sequencing; plasmid; seasonal variation; small ribosomal subunit; species diversity; synteny; urban area; genetics; genomics; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genomics; Metagenome; Sewage","","sulfanilamide, 34612-79-8, 6101-31-1, 63-74-1; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Sewage","We would like to thank everyone who has helped with sampling, shipping, and the logistics of transporting sewage to Denmark since the beginning of the pilot project including the Drainage Services Department, The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a viable technique for capturing the non-linear relationship of historical data to generate highly accurate prediction results. Despite the success in various domains, applying deep learning in Q and H prediction is hampered by three critical issues: a shortage of training data, the occurrence of noise in the collected data, and the difficulty in adjusting the model’s hyper-parameters. This work proposes a novel deep learning-based Q–H prediction model that overcomes all the shortcomings encountered by existing approaches. Specifically, to address data scarcity and increase prediction accuracy, we design an ensemble learning architecture that takes advantage of multiple deep learning techniques. Furthermore, we leverage the Singular-Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to remove noise and outliers from the original data. Besides, we exploit the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to propose a novel mechanism that can automatically determine the prediction model’s optimal hyper-parameters. We conducted extensive experiments on two datasets collected from Vietnam’s Red and Dakbla rivers. The results show that our proposed solution outperforms current techniques across a wide range of metrics, including NSE, MSE, MAE, and MAPE. Specifically, by exploiting the ensemble learning technique, we can improve the NSE by at least 2 %. Moreover, with the aid of the SSA-based data preprocessing technique, the NSE is further enhanced by more than 5 %. Finally, thanks to GA-based optimization, our proposed model increases the NSE by at least 6 % and up to 40 % in the best case. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Funding was provided by Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup JSC), Vingroup (Grant number: VINIF.2020.DA09), and partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 20H04174.

Through image processing, the 3D reconstructions of the deformed structures are characterized by number, geometry, and initial imperfections of the body segments.

The present paper investigates the impact of carbon tax policy on Vietnamese agriculture by focusing on multi-product systems such as rice, livestock, and aquaculture, traditionally called the Vuon (Garden)–Ao (Pond)–Chuong (livestock pen) system (VAC). In it, farmers use garden, pond, and pen by-products as fertilizer and feed. We use shadow prices and Morishima substitution elasticities as greenhouse gas emissions indicators, estimated with directional output distance function. Farmers in the Mekong Delta region are found to be technologically less efficient than in other regions of Vietnam, though the shadow prices of GHG emissions are lower there too. This indicates that farmers in the Mekong Delta, generally concentrating either on livestock or aquaculture, have greater potential for reducing GHG emissions by way of improvements in technical efficiency than do those in other regions. However, Morishima elasticity estimates show that policy impacts diminish more quickly in the Mekong than elswhere. We suggest the Vietnamese government encourage Mekong Delta farmers to employ technologically more efficient methods or shift to more balanced farming to reduce the shadow price of GHG emissions, encouraging more efficient emissions reduction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Greenhouse Gases; Agriculture; Animal; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gas; Livestock; Viet Nam; Agriculture; Animals; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Livestock; Vietnam","agriculture; animal; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; livestock; Viet Nam; Agriculture; Animals; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Livestock; Vietnam","","Greenhouse Gases","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 20K0601.","Faostat Analytical Brief Series no, (2020); Emissions Totals; Initial Biennial Updated Report of Viet Nam to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Viet Nam Publishing House of Natural Resources Environment and Cartography; Value of Agricultural Production; World Bank; Nhu, Trang T., Resource usage of integrated Pig-Biogas-Fish system: Partitioning and substitution within attributional life cycle assessment, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 102, pp. 27-38, (2015); Thanh Hai, Le, Integrated farming system producing zero emissions and sustainable livelihood for small-scale cattle farms: Case study in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, Environmental Pollution, 265, (2020); Herrero, Mario, Smart investments in sustainable food production: Revisiting mixed crop-livestock systems, Science, 327, 5967, pp. 822-825, (2010); Res Trop Agric, (2009); Japanese Journal of Tropical Agriculture, (2005)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","36307426","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140787212"

The most discriminative features were selected from these deep features using iterative neighborhood component analysis, which were then fed to a standard shallow fine k-nearest neighbor classifier for classification using tenfold cross-validation. The proposed shutter blinds-based model was trained and tested on datasets derived from two public databases—University of Northern British Columbia-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database and Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action Database—which both comprised four pain intensity classes that had been labeled by human experts using validated facial action coding system methodology. Our shutter blinds-based classification model attained more than 95% overall accuracy rates on both datasets. The excellent performance suggests that the automated pain intensity classification model can be deployed to assist doctors in the non-verbal detection of pain using facial images in various situations (e.g., non-communicative patients or during surgery). This system can facilitate timely detection and management of pain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithm; British Columbia; Face; Factual Database; Human; Pain; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Face; Humans; Pain","algorithm; British Columbia; face; factual database; human; pain; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Face; Humans; Pain","","","","Bargshady, Ghazal, Enhanced deep learning algorithm development to detect pain intensity from facial expression images, Expert Systems with Applications, 149, (2020); Huang, Yibo, HybNet: a hybrid network structure for pain intensity estimation, Visual Computer, 38, 3, pp. 871-882, (2022); McGrath, Patricia Anne, Psychological aspects of pain perception, Archives of Oral Biology, 39, SUPPL., pp. S55-S62, (1994); Kuner, Rohini, Cellular circuits in the brain and their modulation in acute and chronic pain, Physiological Reviews, 101, 1, pp. 213-258, (2021); Cohen, Steven Paul C., Chronic pain: an update on burden, best practices, and new advances, The Lancet, 397, 10289, pp. 2082-2097, (2021); Dampier, Carlton D., Characteristics of pain managed at home in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease by using diary self-reports, Journal of Pain, 3, 6, pp. 461-470, (2002); Jiang, Mingzhe, Acute pain intensity monitoring with the classification of multiple physiological parameters, Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing, 33, 3, pp. 493-507, (2019); IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics; Jenssen, Marit Dagny Kristine, Machine learning in chronic pain research: A scoping review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 7, (2021); Hassan, Teena, Automatic Detection of Pain from Facial Expressions: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43, 6, pp. 1815-1831, (2021)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","36241674","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139854101"

The phyto-Fenton process was applied to remove pesticide residues in soils. In addition to magnetite (Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) materials added to the soils, fertilizers and elicitors for oxidative burst were also added in the different experimental treatments. Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and isomers were removed in all experimental lots. The removal efficiency was highest in lot B1, a site where only iron materials were added. The removal efficiency and the final content of DDTs in B1 were 98.4% and 0.009 mg kg−1, respectively. In the presence of elicitors, the conversion of DDT to dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene was more favorable. Analysis of soil properties indicated that the phyto-Fenton process can occur at neutral soil pH, and when there are only small changes in soil organic carbon content and cation exchange capacities. Shifts in the composition of the microbial communities were observed. Further studies on the interactions between materials added to soil, plants, and the soil microbiome are needed to understand the mechanism of action of the phyto-Fenton process during soil remediation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biphenyl; Carbon; Chlorphenotane; Iron; Magnetite; Trichloroethane; Vinylidene Chloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane; Biphenyl Compounds; Carbon; Ddt; Dichloroethylenes; Diphenyl; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Fertilizers; Iron; Pesticide Residues; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trichloroethanes; 1,1,1-trichloroethane; Biphenyl; Biphenyl Derivative; Carbon; Chlorphenotane; Fertilizer; Iron; Magnetite; Pesticide Residue; Trichloroethane; Vinylidene Chloride; Chemistry; Ecosystem Restoration; Soil; Soil Pollutant; Viet Nam; Biphenyl Compounds; Carbon; Ddt; Dichloroethylenes; Environmental Restoration And Remediation; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Fertilizers; Iron; Pesticide Residues; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trichloroethanes; Vietnam","1,1,1-trichloroethane; biphenyl; biphenyl derivative; carbon; chlorphenotane; fertilizer; iron; magnetite; pesticide residue; trichloroethane; vinylidene chloride; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; soil; soil pollutant; Viet Nam; Biphenyl Compounds; Carbon; DDT; Dichloroethylenes; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Fertilizers; Iron; Pesticide Residues; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trichloroethanes; Vietnam","","biphenyl, 92-52-4; carbon, 7440-44-0; chlorphenotane, 50-29-3; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnetite, 1309-38-2, 1317-61-9; trichloroethane, 25323-89-1; vinylidene chloride, 25323-30-2, 75-35-4; 1,1,1-trichloroethane; Biphenyl Compounds; Carbon; DDT; Dichloroethylenes; diphenyl; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Fertilizers; Iron; Pesticide Residues; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trichloroethanes","Funding text 1: This study was supported in part by the JFE 21st Century Foundation.

In this study, optimization conditions for high-temperature ethanol fermentation of pineapple waste hydrolysate (PWH) using a newly isolated thermotolerant yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae HG1.1, and the expression of genes during ethanol fermentation at 40 °C were carried out. Three independent variables, including cell concentration, pH, and yeast extract, positively affected ethanol production from PWH at 40 °C. The optimum levels of these significant factors evaluated using response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) were a cell concentration of 8.0 × 107 cells/mL, a pH of 5.5, and a yeast extract concentration of 4.95 g/L, yielding a maximum ethanol concentration of 36.85 g/L and productivity of 3.07 g/L. Gene expression analysis during high-temperature ethanol fermentation using RT–qPCR revealed that the acquisition of thermotolerance ability and ethanol fermentation efficiency of S. cerevisiae HG1.1 are associated with genes responsible for growth and ethanol stress, oxidative stress, acetic acid stress, DNA repair, the pyruvate-to-tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway, and the pyruvate-to-ethanol pathway. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alcohol; Pyruvic Acid; Ethanol; Pyruvates; Alcohol; Pyruvic Acid; Ananas; Fermentation; Gene Expression; Genetics; Heat Tolerance; Metabolism; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Temperature; Ethanol; Fermentation; Gene Expression; Pyruvates; Temperature; Thermotolerance","alcohol; pyruvic acid; Ananas; fermentation; gene expression; genetics; heat tolerance; metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; temperature; Ethanol; Fermentation; Gene Expression; Pyruvates; Temperature; Thermotolerance","","alcohol, 64-17-5; pyruvic acid, 127-17-3, 19071-34-2, 57-60-3; Ethanol; Pyruvates","The authors would like to thank the Faculty of Technology, Khon Kaen University, for a scholarship for HXP for Academic Year 2014 and the International Research Funding by the Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Technology, Khon Kaen University, and the Graduate School, Khon Kaen University, Thailand for partial financial support.

Here, we demonstrate that, compared to other breeds, VnPs have fewer copies of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), which pose a risk for xenotransplantation of pig organs to humans. More specifically, we sought to characterize non-reference PERVs (nrPERVs) that were previously unidentified in the reference genome. To this end, we used whole-genome sequencing data to identify nrPERV loci with long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences in VnPs. RetroSeq was used to estimate nrPERV loci based on the most current porcine reference genome (Sscrofa11.1). LTRs were detected using de novo sequencing read assembly near the loci containing the target site duplication sequences in the inferred regions. A total of 21 non-reference LTR loci were identified and separated into two subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, PERVs within the detected LTR loci were identified, the presence of which was confirmed using conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing. These novel loci represent previously unknown PERVs as they have not been identified in the porcine reference genome. Thus, our RetroSeq method accurately detects novel PERV loci, and can be applied for development of a useful biomedical model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal; Asian; Endogenous Retrovirus; Gammaretrovirus; Genetics; Human; Long Terminal Repeat; Phylogeny; Pig; Xenograft; Animals; Asians; Endogenous Retroviruses; Humans; Phylogeny; Swine; Terminal Repeat Sequences; Transplantation, Heterologous","animal; Asian; endogenous retrovirus; Gammaretrovirus; genetics; human; long terminal repeat; phylogeny; pig; xenograft; Animals; Asians; Endogenous Retroviruses; Humans; Phylogeny; Swine; Terminal Repeat Sequences; Transplantation, Heterologous","","","This study was funded in part by the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS; No. JPMJSA1404) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JST/JICA) and by Accelerating Social Implementation for SDGs Achievement (aXis; No. JPMJAS2006) from JST.

There is evidence that SCCmec disseminates among staphylococci, but the transfer mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that two-component systems mediate the upregulation of natural competence genes in S. aureus under biofilm growth conditions, and this enhances the efficiency of natural transformation. We observe SCCmec transfer via natural transformation from MRSA, and from methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. The process requires the SCCmec recombinase genes ccrAB, and the stability of the transferred SCCmec varies depending on SCCmec types and recipients. Our results suggest that natural transformation plays a role in the transfer of SCCmec and possibly other mobile genetic elements in S. aureus biofilms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacitracin; Cefmetazole; Cefoxitin; Nisin; Oxacillin; Tetracycline; Vancomycin; Bacterial Proteins; Bacitracin; Bacterial Dna; Cefmetazole; Cefoxitin; Nef Protein; Nisin; Oxacillin; Tetracycline; Vancomycin; Bacterial Protein; Antibiotic Resistance; Biofilm; Gene Expression; Gene Flow; 5' Untranslated Region; Accessory Gene Regulator; Article; Bacterial Chromosome; Biotransformation; Cephalosporin Resistance; Colony Forming Unit; Conjugative Plasmid; Controlled Study; Deletion Mutant; Dna Transfer; Fluorescence Microscopy; Genome Size; Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; Mobile Genetic Element; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Nonhuman; Operon; Penicillin Resistance; Promoter Region; Quorum Sensing; Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome Mec; Tetracycline Resistance; Vancomycin Resistance; Vector Control; Genetics; Human; Methicillin Resistance; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus Aureus; Staphylococcus Infection; Bacterial Proteins; Biofilms; Humans; Methicillin Resistance; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus; Staphylococcal Infections","bacitracin; bacterial DNA; cefmetazole; cefoxitin; Nef protein; nisin; oxacillin; tetracycline; vancomycin; bacterial protein; antibiotic resistance; biofilm; gene expression; gene flow; 5' untranslated region; accessory gene regulator; Article; bacterial chromosome; biotransformation; cephalosporin resistance; colony forming unit; conjugative plasmid; controlled study; deletion mutant; DNA transfer; fluorescence microscopy; genome size; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; minimum inhibitory concentration; mobile genetic element; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; operon; penicillin resistance; promoter region; quorum sensing; staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec; tetracycline resistance; vancomycin resistance; vector control; genetics; human; methicillin resistance; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; Bacterial Proteins; Biofilms; Humans; Methicillin Resistance; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcal Infections","","bacitracin, 1405-87-4; cefmetazole, 56796-20-4, 56796-39-5; cefoxitin, 33564-30-6, 35607-66-0; nisin, 1414-45-5; oxacillin, 1173-88-2, 66-79-5, 7240-38-2; tetracycline, 23843-90-5, 60-54-8, 64-75-5, 8021-86-1; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9; Bacterial Proteins","This study was supported by Takeda Science Foundation, The Waksman Foundation of Japan, Pfizer Academic Contributions, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 25860313 and 18H02652, JSPS Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects JPJSBP120199916 (to KM), and Program to Disseminate Tenure Tracking System, MEXT (to RLO).

Climate reanalysis represents an alternative option that provide complete spatio-temporal exposure coverage, and yet are to be systematically explored for their suitability in assessing temperature-related health risks at a global scale. Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis over multiple regions to assess the suitability of the most recent generation of reanalysis datasets for health impact assessments and evaluate their comparative performance against traditional station-based data. Our findings show that reanalysis temperature from the last ERA5 products generally compare well to station observations, with similar non-optimal temperature-related risk estimates. However, the analysis offers some indication of lower performance in tropical regions, with a likely underestimation of heat-related excess mortality. Reanalysis data represent a valid alternative source of exposure variables in epidemiological analyses of temperature-related risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate; Heat; Temperature; Weather; Climate; Hot Temperature; Temperature; Weather","climate; heat; temperature; weather; Climate; Hot Temperature; Temperature; Weather","","","The study was primarily supported by Grants from the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre Seville (Research Contract ID: JRC/SVQ/2020/MVP/1654), Medical Research Council-UK (Grant ID: MR/R013349/1), Natural Environment Research Council UK (Grant ID: NE/R009384/1), European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Project Exhaustion (Grant ID: 820655).

The function of LSD-2 as a regulator of lipolysis has also been demonstrated. However, other LSD-2 functions remain unclear. To investigate the role of LSD-2, we performed tissue-specific depletion in the salivary glands of Drosophila using a combination of the Gal4-upstream activating sequence system and RNA interference. LSD-2 depletion inhibited the entry of salivary gland cells into the endoreplication cycle and delayed this process by enhancing CycE expression, disrupting the development of this organ. The deficiency of LSD-2 expression enhanced reactive oxygen species production in the salivary gland and promoted JNK-dependent apoptosis by suppressing dMyc expression. This phenomenon did not result from lipolysis. Therefore, LSD-2 is vital for endoreplication cell cycle and cell death programs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lipid; Lysergide; Drosophila Proteins; Lipids; Lsd-2 Protein, Drosophila; Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; Drosophila Protein; Lipid; Lsd-2 Protein, Drosophila; Lysergide; Animal; Apoptosis; Drosophila; Endoreduplication; Genetics; Mammal; Mapk Signaling; Metabolism; Salivary Gland; Animals; Apoptosis; Drosophila Proteins; Endoreduplication; Lipids; Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; Mammals; Map Kinase Signaling System; Salivary Glands","Drosophila protein; lipid; LSD-2 protein, Drosophila; lysergide; animal; apoptosis; Drosophila; endoreduplication; genetics; mammal; MAPK signaling; metabolism; salivary gland; Animals; Apoptosis; Drosophila Proteins; Endoreduplication; Lipids; Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; Mammals; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Salivary Glands","","lipid, 66455-18-3; lysergide, 50-37-3; Drosophila Proteins; Lipids; LSD-2 protein, Drosophila; Lysergic Acid Diethylamide","We are grateful to Dr. Anne Ephrussi of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany, for providing the rat anti-LSD-2 antibody.

This study aimed to investigate the association between prehospital fluid resuscitation and outcomes of trauma patients in Asia. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of trauma patients between 2016 and 2018 using data from the Pan-Asia Trauma Outcomes Study (PATOS) database. Prehospital fluid resuscitation was defined as any administration of intravenous crystalloid fluid on the ambulance before arrival to hospitals. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and poor functional outcomes, defined as Modified Rankin Scale ≥ 4. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to equalize potential prognostic factors in both groups. This study included 31,735 patients from six countries in Asia, and 4318 (13.6%) patients had ever received prehospital fluid resuscitation. The patients receiving prehospital fluid resuscitation had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32–3.10, p = 0.001 in PSM analysis. Prehospital fluid resuscitation was also associated with poor functional outcomes, with an OR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.48–2.03, p < 0.001 in PSM analysis. Prehospital fluid resuscitation in patients with major trauma (injury severity score ≥ 16) presented a higher risk of poor functional outcomes (aOR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.89–3.73 in PSM analysis, p<inf>interaction</inf> = 0.006) via subgroup analysis. Prehospital fluid resuscitation of trauma patients is associated with higher in-hospital mortality and poor functional outcomes in the subgroup in countries studied. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crystalloid Solutions; Asia; Clinical Trial; Cohort Analysis; Crystalloid; Emergency Health Service; Epidemiology; Human; Injury; Multicenter Study; Resuscitation; Retrospective Study; Cohort Studies; Crystalloid Solutions; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Resuscitation; Retrospective Studies; Wounds And Injuries","Asia; clinical trial; cohort analysis; crystalloid; emergency health service; epidemiology; human; injury; multicenter study; resuscitation; retrospective study; Cohort Studies; Crystalloid Solutions; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Resuscitation; Retrospective Studies; Wounds and Injuries","","Crystalloid Solutions","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 108-2314-B-002-130-MY3 and MOST 109-2314-B-002-154-MY2).

Using an international survey (N = 3040), we test how infection risk perception, trust in the governmental response and communications about COVID-19, conspiracy beliefs, social norms on distancing, tightness of culture, and community punishment predict various containment-related attitudes and behavior. Autoregressive analyses indicate that, at the personal level, personal hygiene behavior was predicted by personal infection risk perception. At social level, social distancing behaviors such as abstaining from face-to-face contact were predicted by perceived social norms. Support for behavioral mandates was predicted by confidence in the government and cultural tightness, whereas support for anti-lockdown protests was predicted by (lower) perceived clarity of communication about the virus.

This study aimed to determine the association between prehospital spine immobilization and favorable functional outcomes at hospital discharge among trauma patients with SI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pan-Asia Trauma Outcomes Study (PATOS) registry data from January 1, 2016, to November 30, 2018. A total of 759 patients with SI were enrolled from 43,752 trauma patients in the PATOS registry during the study period. The subjects had a median age of 58 years (Q1–Q3, 41–72), and 438 (57.7%) patients had prehospital spine immobilization. Overall, prehospital spinal immobilization was not associated with favorable functional outcomes at discharge in multivariable logistic regression (aOR 1.06; 95% CI 0.62–1.81, p = 0.826). However, in the subgroup of cervical SI, prehospital spinal immobilization was associated with favorable functional outcomes at discharge (aOR 3.14; 95% CI 1.04–9.50; p = 0.043). Therefore, we suggest that paramedics should be more careful when determining the presence of a cervical SI and should apply full spine immobilization if possible. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Clinical Trial; Cohort Analysis; Emergency Health Service; Human; Immobilization; Middle Aged; Multicenter Study; Neck Injury; Procedures; Retrospective Study; Spine Injury; Cohort Studies; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Immobilization; Middle Aged; Neck Injuries; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Injuries","Asia; clinical trial; cohort analysis; emergency health service; human; immobilization; middle aged; multicenter study; neck injury; procedures; retrospective study; spine injury; Cohort Studies; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Immobilization; Middle Aged; Neck Injuries; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Injuries","","","This study was funded by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 108-2314-B-002-130-MY3 and MOST 105-2314-B-002-200-MY3 and MOST 109-2314-B-002 -154-MY2) and Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH-2021-C-074).

However, the giant spin Hall angle (θ<inf>SH</inf> > 1) is limited to a few chalcogenide TIs with toxic elements and low melting points, making them challenging for device integration during the silicon Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) process. Here, we show that by using a half-Heusler alloy topological semi-metal (HHA-TSM), YPtBi, it is possible to achieve both a giant θ<inf>SH</inf> up to 4.1 and a high thermal budget up to 600 °C. We demonstrate magnetization switching of a CoPt thin film using the giant spin Hall effect of YPtBi by current densities lower than those of heavy metals by one order of magnitude.

Here we convened, as part of this Delphi study, a diverse, multidisciplinary panel of 386 academic, health, non-governmental organization, government and other experts in COVID-19 response from 112 countries and territories to recommend specific actions to end this persistent global threat to public health. The panel developed a set of 41 consensus statements and 57 recommendations to governments, health systems, industry and other key stakeholders across six domains: communication; health systems; vaccination; prevention; treatment and care; and inequities. In the wake of nearly three years of fragmented global and national responses, it is instructive to note that three of the highest-ranked recommendations call for the adoption of whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches1, while maintaining proven prevention measures using a vaccines-plus approach2 that employs a range of public health and financial support measures to complement vaccination. Other recommendations with at least 99% combined agreement advise governments and other stakeholders to improve communication, rebuild public trust and engage communities3 in the management of pandemic responses. The findings of the study, which have been further endorsed by 184 organizations globally, include points of unanimous agreement, as well as six recommendations with >5% disagreement, that provide health and social policy actions to address inadequacies in the pandemic response and help to bring this public health threat to an end. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Sars-cov-2 Vaccine; Covid-19; Government; Public Health; Social Policy; Article; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Delphi Study; Female; Financial Management; Health Care System; Human; Infection Prevention; Interpersonal Communication; Male; Pandemic; Policy; Stakeholder Engagement; Threat; Trust; Vaccination; Vaccine Hesitancy; Prevention And Control; Delphi Technique; Government; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; COVID-19; government; public health; social policy; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; Delphi study; female; financial management; health care system; human; infection prevention; interpersonal communication; male; pandemic; policy; stakeholder engagement; threat; trust; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; prevention and control; Delphi Technique; Government; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health","","","Funding text 1: J.V.L. reports research grants to his institution from AbbVie, Gilead Sciences and MSD, and speaker fees from AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, Intercept, Janssen, MSD and ViiV, and an advisory board fee from AbbVie and Novavax, all unrelated to this work.

Butterflies are a conspicuous and ubiquitous component of urban nature across megacities that are highly urbanized with little opportunity for human-nature interactions. We evaluated public familiarity with, perceptions of and attitudes toward butterflies across nine megacities in East and Southeast Asia through face-to-face interviews with 1774 urban park users. A total of 79% of respondents had seen butterflies in their cities mostly in urban parks, indicating widespread familiarity with butterflies. Those who had seen butterflies also had higher perceptions of butterflies, whereas greater than 50% of respondents had positive attitudes toward butterflies. Frequent visits to natural places in urban neighbourhoods was associated with (i) sightings of caterpillars, indicating increased familiarity with urban wildlife, and (ii) increased connectedness to nature. We found two significant positive relationships: (i) between connectedness to nature and attitudes toward butterflies and (ii) between connectedness to nature and perceptions of butterflies, firmly linking parks users' thoughts and feelings about butterflies with their view of nature. This suggests that butterflies in urban parks can play a key role in building connectedness to nature and consequently pro-environmental behaviours and support for wildlife conservation among urban residents. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Butterflies; Conservation; Human-wildlife Interactions; Megacities; Nature Experiences; Urban Wildlife","","","","Funding text 1: The authors thank Naresuan University, Kunming Institute of Zoology and the International Botanical Congress held in Shenzhen in 2017 for supporting this work.

Recent independent genome-wide association studies of glaucoma, optic neuropathy characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration, and vision loss found that single-nucleotide polymorphisms near the ABCA1 locus were common risk factors. Here, we show that Abca1 loss in retinal astrocytes causes glaucoma-like optic neuropathy in aged mice. ABCA1 was highly expressed in retinal astrocytes in mice. Thus, we generated macroglia-specific Abca1-deficient mice (Glia-KO) and found that aged Glia-KO mice had RGC degeneration and ocular dysfunction without affected intraocular pressure, a conventional risk factor for glaucoma. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Abca1 deficiency in aged Glia-KO mice caused astrocyte-triggered inflammation and increased the susceptibility of certain RGC clusters to excitotoxicity. Together, astrocytes play a pivotal role in eye diseases, and loss of ABCA1 in astrocytes causes glaucoma-like neuropathy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mammals; Aged Mouse; Cell Degeneration; Genome-wide Association Studies; Intraocular Pressure; Optic Neuropathies; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Risk Factors; Single Cells; Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms; Vision Loss; Ophthalmology","Mammals; Aged mouse; Cell degeneration; Genome-wide association studies; Intraocular pressure; Optic neuropathies; Retinal ganglion cells; Risk factors; Single cells; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Vision loss; Ophthalmology","","","","Weinreb, Robert N., The pathophysiology and treatment of glaucoma: A review, JAMA, 311, 18, pp. 1901-1911, (2014); Weinreb, Robert N., Primary open-angle glaucoma, Nature Reviews Disease Primers, 2, (2016); Chen, Yuhong, Common variants near ABCA1 and in PMM2 are associated with primary open-angle glaucoma, Nature Genetics, 46, 10, pp. 1115-1119, (2014); Gharahkhani, Puya, Common variants near ABCA1, AFAP1 and GMDS confer risk of primary open-angle glaucoma, Nature Genetics, 46, 10, pp. 1120-1125, (2014); Hysi, Dr Pirro, Genome-wide analysis of multi-ancestry cohorts identifies new loci influencing intraocular pressure and susceptibility to glaucoma, Nature Genetics, 46, 10, pp. 1126-1130, (2014); Khawaja, Anthony P., Genome-wide analyses identify 68 new loci associated with intraocular pressure and improve risk prediction for primary open-angle glaucoma, Nature Genetics, 50, 6, pp. 778-782, (2018); Hamon, Yannick, ABC1 promotes engulfment of apoptotic cells and transbilayer redistribution of phosphatidylserine, Nature Cell Biology, 2, 7, pp. 399-406, (2000); Morizawa, Yosuke M., Reactive astrocytes function as phagocytes after brain ischemia via ABCA1-mediated pathway, Nature Communications, 8, 1, (2017); Castella, Barbara, The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 regulates phosphoantigen release and Vγ39Vδ2 T cell activation by dendritic cells, Nature Communications, 8, (2017); Zha, Xiaohui, Endocytosis is enhanced in tangier fibroblasts.

Our results show an increase in the number of African countries that are able to sequence domestically and highlight that local sequencing enables faster turnaround times and more-regular routine surveillance. Despite limitations of low testing proportions, findings from this genomic surveillance study underscore the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic and illuminate the distinct dispersal dynamics of variants of concern—particularly Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron—on the continent. Sustained investment for diagnostics and genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve while the continent faces many emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats. These investments are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response and will serve the health of the continent well into the 21st century. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Genome; Genomics; Infectious Disease; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Africa; Article; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Disaster Preparedness; Disease Surveillance; Epidemic; Epidemiological Surveillance; Gene Sequence; Genomic Surveillance; Geographic Distribution; Human; Investment; Nonhuman; Pandemic; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Sars-cov-2 Alpha; Sars-cov-2 Beta; Sars-cov-2 Delta; Sars-cov-2 Omicron; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Temporal Analysis; Turnaround Time; Variant Of Concern; Virus Genome; Virus Transmission; Epidemiology; Genetics; Genomics; Humans; Pandemics; Sars-cov-2","COVID-19; genome; genomics; infectious disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Africa; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disaster preparedness; disease surveillance; epidemic; epidemiological surveillance; gene sequence; genomic surveillance; geographic distribution; human; investment; nonhuman; pandemic; phylogeny; phylogeography; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Beta; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; temporal analysis; turnaround time; variant of concern; virus genome; virus transmission; epidemiology; genetics; Genomics; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","","","","Li, Qun, Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 13, pp. 1199-1207, (2020); Hasell, Joe, A cross-country database of COVID-19 testing, Scientific Data, 7, 1, (2020); Viana, Raquel V., Rapid epidemic expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in southern Africa, Nature, 603, 7902, pp. 679-686, (2022); Tegally, Houriiyah, Detection of a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern in South Africa, Nature, 592, 7854, pp. 438-443, (2021); Martin, Darren Patrick, The emergence and ongoing convergent evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y lineages, Cell, 184, 20, pp. 5189-5200.e7, (2021); Campbell, Finlay, Increased transmissibility and global spread of SARSCoV- 2 variants of concern as at June 2021, Eurosurveillance, 26, 24, pp. 1-6, (2021); Korber, Bette T., Tracking Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: Evidence that D614G Increases Infectivity of the COVID-19 Virus, Cell, 182, 4, pp. 812-827.e19, (2020); Hacisuleyman, Ezgi, Vaccine breakthrough infections with SARS-COV-2 variants, New England Journal of Medicine, 384, 23, pp. 2212-2218, (2021); Planas, Delphine, Reduced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta to antibody neutralization, Nature, 596, 7871, pp. 276-280, (2021); Yue, Shuai, Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Variants to Neutralization by Convalescent Sera and a VH3-30 Monoclonal Antibody, Frontiers in Immunology, 12, (2021)","","American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","","","10959203; 00368075","9781844654512; 9781844652044","SCIEA","36108049","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139379306"

We elucidated that hepatotoxin-damaged and fibrotic livers gave rise to LSECs-iGap formation, which was positively correlated with increased numbers of metastatic liver foci after intrasplenic injection of Hepa1-6 cells. Hepa1-6 cells induced interleukin-23-dependent tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion by LSECs and triggered LSECs-iGap formation, toward which their processes protruded to transmigrate into the liver parenchyma. TNF-α triggered depolymerization of F-actin and induced matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), intracellular adhesion molecule 1, and CXCL expression in LSECs. Blocking MMP9 activity by doxycycline or an MMP2/9 inhibitor eliminated LSECs-iGap formation and attenuated liver metastasis of Hepa1-6 cells. Overall, this study revealed that cancer cells induced LSEC-iGap formation via proinflammatory paracrine mechanisms and proposed MMP9 as a favorable target for blocking cancer cell metastasis to the liver. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Doxycycline; Gelatinase A; Gelatinase B; Actins; Doxycycline; Interleukin-23; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Cell Death; Diseases; Endothelial Cells; Pathology; Proteins; Cancer Cells; Cell/b.e; Gap Formation; Liver Metastasis; Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells; Matrix Metalloproteinase-9; Paracrine; Proinflammatory; Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells; Tumor Necrosis Factors; Actin; Doxycycline; Gelatinase A; Gelatinase B; Interleukin 23; Tumor Necrosis Factor; Animal; Endothelium Cell; Human; Inbred Mouse Strain; Liver; Liver Tumor; Metabolism; Mouse; Pathology; Actins; Animals; Doxycycline; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Interleukin-23; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Cell death; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Pathology; Proteins; Cancer cells; Cell/B.E; Gap formation; Liver metastasis; Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; Matrix metalloproteinase-9; Paracrine; Proinflammatory; Sinusoidal endothelial cells; Tumor necrosis factors; actin; doxycycline; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; interleukin 23; tumor necrosis factor; animal; endothelium cell; human; inbred mouse strain; liver; liver tumor; metabolism; mouse; pathology; Actins; Animals; Doxycycline; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Interleukin-23; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","","doxycycline, 10592-13-9, 17086-28-1, 564-25-0, 94088-85-4; gelatinase A, 146480-35-5; gelatinase B, 146480-36-6; Actins; Doxycycline; Interleukin-23; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","We would like to express our deepest appreciation to L.

It not only promotes product quality but also helps policy makers determine strategies to develop the national shrimp industry. Competition in global markets is considered to be an important factor, one that significantly influences price. In this study, we predicted trends in the export price of Vietnamese shrimp based on competitive information from six leading exporters (China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Ecuador, and Chile) who, alongside Vietnam, also export shrimp to the US. The prediction was based on a dataset collected from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) (May-1995 to May-2019) that included price, required farming certificates, and disease outbreak data. A super learner technique, which combined 10 single algorithms, was used to make predictions in selected base periods (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). It was found that the super learner obtained results in all base periods that were more accurate and stable than any candidate algorithms. The impacts of variables in the predictive model were interpreted by a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to determine their influence on the price of Vietnamese exports. The price of Indian, Thai, and Chinese exports highlighted the advantages of being a World Trade Organization member and the disadvantages of the prevalence of shrimp disease in Vietnam, which has had a significant impact on the Vietnamese shrimp export price. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Consumer Price Index; Controlled Study; Crustacean Disease; Epidemiological Data; Financial Management; Human; Machine Learning; Management; Marketing; Nonhuman; Prevalence; Sea Food; Shrimp; Trend Study; United States; Vietnamese; World Trade Organization; Animal; Asian; Crustacea; Viet Nam; Animals; Asians; Humans; Machine Learning; Seafood; Vietnam","Article; consumer price index; controlled study; crustacean disease; epidemiological data; financial management; human; machine learning; management; marketing; nonhuman; prevalence; sea food; shrimp; trend study; United States; Vietnamese; World Trade Organization; animal; Asian; Crustacea; Viet Nam; Animals; Asians; Humans; Machine Learning; Seafood; Vietnam","","","","Report on Vietnam Shrimp Sector 2009 2018, (2018); State of Food and Agriculture 2018 Migration Agriculture and Rural Development, (2018); Duc, Nguyenminh, Economic contribution of fish culture to farm income in Southeast Vietnam, Aquaculture International, 17, 1, pp. 15-29, (2009); Research in Agriculture and Applied Economics, (2007); Status and Constraints of Costly Port Rejection A Case from the Vietnamese Frozen Seafood Export Industry, (2013); Dong, Khuu Thi Phuong, Pressure–State–Response of traceability implementation in seafood-exporting countries: evidence from Vietnamese shrimp products, Aquaculture International, 27, 5, pp. 1209-1229, (2019); Anti Dumping Measures on Shrimp Imports A Case Study of the Dispute Between the U S Southern Shrimp Alliance Ssa and Shrimp Exporters from China India Thailand Vietnam Ecuador and Brazil, (2016); Tang, Kathy Fengjyu J., Impacts of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease on commercial shrimp aquaculture, OIE Revue Scientifique et Technique, 38, 2, pp. 477-490, (2019); Estrada-Perez, Nallely, Economic risk scenarios for semi-intensive production of Litopenaeus (Penaeus) vannamei shrimp affected by acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease, Aquaculture Reports, 18, (2020); Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease Ahpnd of Penaeid Shrimps Global Perspective, (2016)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","36174038","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138942841"

This study aims to determine the rate and associated factors of caesarean deliveries in urban areas of Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional study using questionnaire answered by women who had infants aged under 30 months was conducted from March to May 2021. Data were collected in 18 commune health centres in two cities during the day of routine immunization. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess factors associated with caesarean section. Results The overall caesarean section rate was 49.6%. The caesarean section rate in private hospitals (57.8%) were significantly higher than in public hospitals (49.1%). Caesarean section rate in first-time mothers (47.1%) were as high as this rate among mothers who had given birth before (50.6%). Factors associated with higher rate of caesarean section include increasing in women’s age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, and infant’s birth weight; first-time mothers; mothers living in urban areas; and mothers giving birth in private hospitals. Conclusions This study revealed a high rate of caesarean deliveries in urban areas of Vietnam. Comprehensive investigations of both medical and non-medical reasons for caesarean deliveries in Vietnam are urgent needs to shape the prioritized interventions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Birth Weight; Body Mass; Body Weight; Cesarean Section; Childbirth; City; Cross-sectional Study; Female; Gestational Weight Gain; Health Center; Human; Human Experiment; Immunization; Infant; Mother; Multicenter Study; Pregnancy; Private Hospital; Public Hospital; Questionnaire; Urban Area; Viet Nam; Birth; Epidemiology; Cesarean Section; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Hospitals, Private; Humans; Parturition; Pregnancy; Vietnam","article; birth weight; body mass; body weight; cesarean section; childbirth; city; cross-sectional study; female; gestational weight gain; health center; human; human experiment; immunization; infant; mother; multicenter study; pregnancy; private hospital; public hospital; questionnaire; urban area; Viet Nam; birth; epidemiology; Cesarean Section; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hospitals, Private; Humans; Parturition; Pregnancy; Vietnam","","","This research is funded by Funds for Science and Technology Development of the University of Danang under project number B2020-DN01-28.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV service access and delivery in the Asia region. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional, online study, conducted between October-November 2020, assessed the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and care among people living with HIV (PLHIV), key populations (KPs), and healthcare providers (HCPs). The study populations were recruited across ten Asian countries/territories, covering Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Results Across the region, 702 PLHIV, 551 KPs, and 145 HCPs were recruited. Both PLHIV and KPs reported decreased or had yet to visit hospitals/clinics (PLHIV: 35.9%; KPs: 57.5%), reduced HIV RNA viral load testing (21.9%; 47.3%), and interruptions in antiretroviral therapy (ART) (22.3%) or decreased/complete stop of HIV prevention medication consumption (40.9%). Travel constraints (40.6%), financial issues (28.9%), and not receiving prescription refills (26.9%) were common reasons for interrupted ART access, whereas reduced engagements in behaviours that could increase the risks of HIV acquisition and transmission (57.7%), travel constraints (41.8%), and less hospital/clinic visits (36.7%) underlie the disruptions in HIV preventive medications. Decreased visits from PLHIV/KPs and rescheduled appointments due to clinic closure were respectively reported by 50.7%-52.1% and 15.6%-17.0% of HCPs; 43.6%-61.9% observed decreased ART/preventive medication refills. Although 85.0% of HCPs adopted telemedicine to deliver HIV care services, 56.4%- 64.1% of PLHIV/KPs were not using telehealth services. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic substantially disrupted HIV prevention to care continuum in Asia at the time of the study. The findings highlighted differences in HIV prevention to care continuum via telehealth services utilisation by PLHIV, KPs, and HCPs. Efforts are needed to optimise infrastructure and adapt systems for continued HIV care with minimal disruptions during health emergency crises. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Virus Rna; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy; Article; Asia; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Drug Use; Female; Financial Stress; Geographic Distribution; Health Behavior; Health Care Access; Health Care Delivery; Health Care Personnel; Health Care Utilization; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Major Clinical Study; Male; Public Health; Telemedicine; Travel; Treatment Interruption; Virus Load; Virus Transmission; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; Hong Kong; Pandemic; Patient Care; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Continuity Of Patient Care; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Health Personnel; Hiv Infections; Humans; Pandemics","virus RNA; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Asia; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; drug use; female; financial stress; geographic distribution; health behavior; health care access; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; public health; telemedicine; travel; treatment interruption; virus load; virus transmission; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Hong Kong; pandemic; patient care; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Continuity of Patient Care; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Personnel; HIV Infections; Humans; Pandemics","","","","Competing Health Risks Associated with the Covid 19 Pandemic and Response A Scoping Review Medrxiv, (2021); WHO Releases Guidelines to Help Countries Maintain Essential Health Services During the Covid 19 Pandemic; Ji, Yunpeng, Potential association between COVID-19 mortality and health-care resource availability, The Lancet Global Health, 8, 4, (2020); Understanding the HIV Care Continuum, (2019); Fujita, Masami, A new analytical framework of 'continuum of prevention and care' to maximize HIV case detection and retention in care in Vietnam, BMC Health Services Research, 12, 1, (2012); HIV AIDS, (2025); Covid 19 and HIV, (2020); Inews Co Uk, (2020); Sun, Yinghui, Antiretroviral treatment interruption among people living with HIV during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a nationwide cross-sectional study, Journal of the International AIDS Society, 23, 11, (2020); Kowalska, Justyna Dominika, HIV care in times of the COVID-19 crisis — Where are we now in Central and Eastern Europe?, International Journal of Infectious Diseases, 96, pp. 311-314, (2020)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","35857755","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134580527"

Here, we improve the foundation for effective conservation of global tree diversity by analyzing a recently developed database of tree species covering 46,752 species. We quantify range protection and anthropogenic pressures for each species and develop conservation priorities across taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity dimensions. We also assess the effectiveness of several influential proposed conservation prioritization frameworks to protect the top 17% and top 50% of tree priority areas. We find that an average of 50.2% of a tree species’ range occurs in 110-km grid cells without any protected areas (PAs), with 6,377 small-range tree species fully unprotected, and that 83% of tree species experience nonnegligible human pressure across their range on average. Protecting high-priority areas for the top 17% and 50% priority thresholds would increase the average protected proportion of each tree species’ range to 65.5% and 82.6%, respectively, leaving many fewer species (2,151 and 2,010) completely unprotected. The priority areas identified for trees match well to the Global 200 Ecoregions framework, revealing that priority areas for trees would in large part also optimize protection for terrestrial biodiversity overall. Based on range estimates for >46,000 tree species, our findings show that a large proportion of tree species receive limited protection by current PAs and are under substantial human pressure. Improved protection of biodiversity overall would also strongly benefit global tree diversity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Conservation Frameworks; Land Use; Protected Areas; Tree Species; Article; Biodiversity; Biogeographic Region; Comparative Effectiveness; Functional Diversity; Grid Cell; Human; Human Cell; Land Use; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Phylogeny; Procedures; Biodiversity; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Phylogeny","article; biodiversity; biogeographic region; comparative effectiveness; functional diversity; grid cell; human; human cell; land use; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; environmental protection; phylogeny; procedures; Biodiversity; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Phylogeny","","","Funding text 1: AK, AKPM, ALCB, ALTA, ALU, AMD, AMES, AMNH, AMO, ANGU, ANSM, ANSP, AQP, ARAN, ARIZ, AS, ASDM, ASU, AUT, AV, AWH, B, BA, BAA, BAB, BABY, BACP, BAF, BAFC, BAI, BAJ, BAL, BARC, BAS, BBB, BBS, BC, BCMEX, BCN, BCRU, BEREA, BESA, BG, BH, BHCB, BIO, BISH, BLA, BM, BOCH, BOL, BOLV, BONN, BOON, BOTU, BOUM, BPI, BR, BREM, BRI, BRIT, BRLU, BRM, BSB, BUT, C, CALI, CAN, CANB, CANU, CAS, CATA, CATIE, CAY, CBM, CDA, CDBI, CEN, CEPEC, CESJ, CGE, CGMS, CHAM, CHAPA, CHAS, CHR, CHSC, CIB, CICY, CIIDIR, CIMI, CINC, CLEMS, CLF, CMM, CMMEX, CNPO, CNS, COA, COAH, COCA, CODAGEM, COFC, COL, COLO, CONC, CORD, CP, CPAP, CPUN, CR, CRAI, CRP, CS, CSU, CSUSB, CTES, CTESN, CU, CUVC, CUZ, CVRD, DAO, DAV, DBG, DBN, DES, DLF, DNA, DPU, DR, DS, DSM, DUKE, DUSS, E, EA, EAC, EAN, EBUM, ECON, EIF, EIU, EMMA, ENCB, ER, ERA, ESA, ETH, F, FAA, FAU, FAUC, FB, FCME, FCO, FCQ, FEN, FHO, FI, FLAS, FLOR, FM, FR, FRU, FSU, FTG, FUEL, FULD, FURB, G, GAT, GB, GDA, GENT, GES, GH, GI, GLM, GMDRC, GMNHJ, GOET, GRA, GUA, GZU, H, HA, HAC, HAL, HAM, HAMAB, HAO, HAS, HASU, HB, HBG, HBR, HCIB, HEID, HGM, HIB, HIP, HNT, HO, HPL, HRCB, HRP, HSC, HSS, HU, HUA, HUAA, HUAL, HUAZ, HUCP, HUEFS, HUEM, HUFU, HUJ, HUSA, HUT, HXBH, HYO, IAA, IAC, IAN, IB, IBGE, IBK, IBSC, IBUG, ICEL, ICESI, ICN, IEA, IEB, ILL, ILLS, IMSSM, INB, INEGI, INIF, INM, INPA, IPA, IPRN, IRVC, ISC, ISKW, ISL, ISTC, ISU, IZAC, IZTA, JACA, JBAG, JBGP, JCT, JE, JEPS, JOTR, JROH, JUA, JYV, K, KIEL, KMN, KMNH, KOELN, KOR, KPM, KSC, KSTC, KSU, KTU, KU, KUN, KYO, L, LA, LAGU, LBG, LD, LE, LEB, LIL, LINC, LINN, LISE, LISI, LISU, LL, LMS, LOJA, LOMA, LP, LPAG, LPB, LPD, LPS, LSU, LSUM, LTB, LTR, LW, LYJB, LZ, M, MA, MACF, MAF, MAK, MARS, MARY, MASS, MB, MBK, MBM, MBML, MCNS, MEL, MELU, MEN, MERL, MEXU, MFA, MFU, MG, MGC, MICH, MIL, MIN, MISSA, MJG, MMMN, MNHM, MNHN, MO, MOL, MOR, MPN, MPU, MPUC, MSB, MSC, MSUN, MT, MTMG, MU, MUB, MUR, MVFA, MVFQ, MVJB, MVM, MW, MY, N, NA, NAC, NAS, NCU, NE, NH, NHM, NHMC, NHT, NLH, NM, NMB, NMNL, NMR, NMSU, NSPM, NSW, NT, NU, NUM, NY, NZFRI, O, OBI, ODU, OS, OSA, OSC, OSH, OULU, OWU, OXF, P, PACA, PAMP, PAR, PASA, PDD, PE, PEL, PERTH, PEUFR, PFC, PGM, PH, PKDC, PLAT, PMA, POM, PORT, PR, PRC, PRE, PSU, PY, QCA, QCNE, QFA, QM, QRS, QUE, R, RAS, RB, RBR, REG, RELC, RFA, RIOC, RM, RNG, RSA, RYU, S, SACT, SALA, SAM, SAN, SANT, SAPS, SASK, SAV, SBBG, SBT, SCFS, SD, SDSU, SEL, SEV, SF, SFV, SGO, SI, SIU, SJRP, SJSU, SLPM, SMDB, SMF, SNM, SOM, SP, SPF, SPSF, SQF, SRFA, STL, STU, SUU, SVG, TAES, TAI, TAIF, TALL, TAM, TAMU, TAN, TASH, TEF, TENN, TEPB, TEX, TFC, TI, TKPM, TNS, TO, TOYA, TRA, TRH, TROM, TRT, TRTE, TU, TUB, U, UADY, UAM, UAMIZ, UB, UBC, UC, UCMM, UCR, UCS, UCSB, UCSC, UEC, UESC, UFG, UFMA, UFMT, UFP, UFRJ, UFRN, UFS, UGDA, UH, UI, UJAT, ULM, ULS, UME, UMO, UNA, UNB, UNCC, UNEX, UNITEC, UNL, UNM, UNR, UNSL, UPCB, UPEI, UPNA, UPS, US, USAS, USF, USJ, USM, USNC, USP, USZ, UT, UTC, UTEP, UU, UVIC, UWO, V, VAL, VALD, VDB, VEN, VIT, VMSL, VT, W, WAG, WAT, WELT, WFU, WII, WIN, WIS, WMNH, WOLL, WS, WTU, WU, XAL, YAMA, Z, ZMT, ZSS, and ZT.

This study attempted to shed light on these paradoxes by understanding the business collaboration between the host community and travel agencies through two case studies in central Vietnam. Data were obtained through empirical surveys conducted in 2018. The data were then analyzed by applying the three-stage framework of the CBT development process. These results highlight two implicit paradoxes that lead to dilemmatic scenarios during CBT development. First, the results heavily emphasize the role of the private sector in supporting tourism growth, yet excessive control leads to elite capture, wage gaps, unfair competition, and issues of non-authenticity. Second, tourism companies seek to transform the community’s resources into unique tourism values; unfortunately, these values do not include villagers’ trust, norms, and identity. Ultimately, this causes villagers to react negatively to these enterprises. Although examples of backlash unintentionally harmed tourism success, collective action and the persistence of traditional norms enabled host communities to maintain their value of honesty, customs, and beliefs against being too dependent on outside groups. Recognizing these issues, this study proposes tourism-related policy implications to avoid such situations, mitigate risks, and maximize the benefits for local community groups. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Community-based Tourism; Ethnic Minority; Paradoxes; Three-stage Framework","","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for their scholarship to support this work.

The cages were located in Dong Thap (DT), Vinh Long (VL), and An Giang (AG) provinces (Vietnam). The formulated diets contained iso-nitrogenous (30.5% crude protein) and iso-lipid (5.2% lipid) compounds and were supplemented with HK L-137 at either 0 (control) or 4 mg/kg. Results indicated HK L-137 had positive effects on the weight gain, final weight, protein efficiency ratio, feed conversion ratio, survival rates, and yield of the fish as compared to the control. The red blood cell count was significantly higher in fish fed with HK L-137 than those in the control group in DT (HK L-137: 2.67 cells/mm3 vs. control: 2.28 cells/mm3) and AG (HK L-137: 2.83 cells/mm3 vs. control: 2.47 cells/mm3) at 4 months (P<0.05). The white blood cell count was significantly increased in fish fed with HK L-137 cultured in three locations at 2 and 4 months as compared to the control (P<0.05). The lysozyme activity of the fish fed HK L-137 was significantly higher than those fed a control diet in three locations at 2 and 4 months of feeding (P<0.05).

Lippold (C. peruviana) has been extensively used for its antifungal and antibacterial properties. However, its role in anti-insect is still under investigation. To investigate the ability of the ethanol extract of C. peruviana against insects, we used the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) as a model to gain more insight into the toxic effects of this extract. We found that the ethanol extract from the stem and leaves of C. peruviana was effective against insects and contained polyphenol and flavonoid compounds. C. peruviana could induce mortality of 2nd-instar larvae and reduce growth and reproduction of fruit flies. Interestingly, the toxicity of C. peruviana extract has been remained to affect the development of the next generation of fruit flies. The locomotor activity and feeding ability of the F1 generation of this insect were significantly reduced by C. peruviana. In addition, flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as saponins and tannins were detected in the ethanol extract of C. peruviana. We assume that the ability of the extract of C. peruviana to control insects may be related to the presence of high levels of these compounds. The findings highlighted that the extract from the leaves of Cascabela peruviana has the potential to be used as an insecticide. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cascabela Peruviana (l.)

However, few assessed whether TV modifies the heat-mortality association. Data on daily temperature and mortality in the warm season were collected from 717 locations across 36 countries. TV was calculated as the standard deviation of the average of the same and previous days’ minimum and maximum temperatures. We used location-specific quasi-Poisson regression models with an interaction term between the cross-basis term for mean temperature and quartiles of TV to obtain heat-mortality associations under each quartile of TV, and then pooled estimates at the country, regional, and global levels. Results show the increased risk in heat-related mortality with increments in TV, accounting for 0.70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.33 to 1.69), 1.34% (95% CI: −0.14 to 2.73), 1.99% (95% CI: 0.29–3.57), and 2.73% (95% CI: 0.76–4.50) of total deaths for Q1–Q4 (first quartile–fourth quartile) of TV. The modification effects of TV varied geographically. Central Europe had the highest attributable fractions (AFs), corresponding to 7.68% (95% CI: 5.25–9.89) of total deaths for Q4 of TV, while the lowest AFs were observed in North America, with the values for Q4 of 1.74% (95% CI: −0.09 to 3.39). TV had a significant modification effect on the heat-mortality association, causing a higher heat-related mortality burden with increments of TV. Implementing targeted strategies against heat exposure and fluctuant temperatures simultaneously would benefit public health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heat; Modification Effect; Mortality; Temperature Variability; Regression Analysis; Attributable Fraction; Confidence Interval; Daily Temperatures; Fluctuating Temperatures; Heat; Heat Mortality; Heat-related Mortalities; Modification Effect; Mortality; Temperature Variability; Association Reactions","Regression analysis; Attributable fraction; Confidence interval; Daily temperatures; Fluctuating temperatures; Heat; Heat mortality; Heat-related mortalities; Modification effect; Mortality; Temperature variability; Association reactions","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Australian Research Council ( DP210102076 ) and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council ( APP2000581 ).

Moreover, a combined analysis of nearly 20 years of SK data (1996-2018) has been performed, with a 90% C.L. sensitivity to the DSNB flux comparable to various DSNB predictions. No significant evidence for a DSNB signal has been observed, and both analyses set world-leading limits on the DSNB flux that can reach about 2.7ν<inf>e</inf>.cm−2.s−1 for a wide range of models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cosmology; Background Modelling; Background Prediction; Background Signals; Combined Analysis; Energy; Energy Ranges; Neutrino Background; Reduction Techniques; Supernova Neutrinos; Supernovae","Cosmology; Background modelling; Background prediction; Background signals; Combined analysis; Energy; Energy ranges; Neutrino background; Reduction techniques; Supernova neutrinos; Supernovae","","","","Zhang, Haibing, Supernova Relic Neutrino search with neutron tagging at Super-Kamiokande-IV, Astroparticle Physics, 60, pp. 41-46, (2015); Bays, Kirk, Supernova relic neutrino search at super-Kamiokande, Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology, 85, 5, (2012); Zhang, Yang, First measurement of radioactive isotope production through cosmic-ray muon spallation in Super-Kamiokande IV, Physical Review D, 93, 1, (2016); Horiuchi, Shunsaku, Diffuse supernova neutrino background is detectable in Super-Kamiokande, Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology, 79, 8, (2009); Hayato, Yoshinari, A neutrino interaction simulation program library NEUT, Acta Physica Polonica B, 40, 9, pp. 2477-2489, (2009); Abe, Ko, Measurement of neutrino and antineutrino neutral-current quasielasticlike interactions on oxygen by detecting nuclear deexcitation γ rays, Physical Review D, 100, 11, (2019); Gando, Azusa, Search for extraterrestrial antineutrino sources with the KamLAND detector, Astrophysical Journal, 745, 2, (2012); Kresse, Daniel, Stellar Collapse Diversity and the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, Astrophysical Journal, 909, 2, (2021); Galais, Sébastien, Shock waves in supernovae: New implications on the diffuse supernova neutrino background, Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology, 81, 5, (2010); Horiuchi, Shunsaku, Impact of binary interactions on the diffuse supernova neutrino background, Physical Review D, 103, 4, (2021)","","Sissa Medialab Srl","","37th International Cosmic Ray Conference, ICRC 2021","","Virtual, Berlin","177942","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145260138"

With the advent of the SK-Gd era, with Gadolinium being dissolved in the SK water, the efficiency of the neutron tagging procedure will increase dramatically, and the SK experiment will make significant gains in its sensitivity to the DSNB.

Measurements of the charge ratio and polarization of cosmic-ray muons can be used to constrain high energy hadronic interaction models in the atmosphere. In this presentation, we will report the current status of the measurement of the charge ratio using data collected by the Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector located at a depth of 2700 m of water equivalent. Using the data taken in the fourth phase of SK (SK-IV), the charge ratio is measured to be 1.42 ± 0.02 (statistical uncertainty only), at the energy of 1.3 TeV. This result for the charge ratio is in good agreement with those previously obtained by deep underground experiments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Charged Particles; Cosmic Rays; Hadrons; Polarization; Charge Polarization; Charge Ratio; Cosmic Particles; Cosmic-ray Muons; Energy; Hadronic Interactions; High-energy Hadronic Interactions; Measurements Of; Secondary Particles; Top Of The Atmospheres; Cosmology","Charged particles; Cosmic rays; Hadrons; Polarization; Charge polarization; Charge ratio; Cosmic particles; Cosmic-ray muons; Energy; Hadronic interactions; High-energy hadronic interactions; Measurements of; Secondary particles; Top of the atmospheres; Cosmology","","","","Khachatryan, Vardan A., Measurement of the charge ratio of atmospheric muons with the CMS detector, Physics Letters, Section B: Nuclear, Elementary Particle and High-Energy Physics, 692, 2, pp. 83-104, (2010); Agafonova, Natalia Yu, Measurement of the atmospheric muon charge ratio with the OPERA detector, European Physical Journal C, 67, 1, pp. 25-37, (2010); Fukuda, Shigekazu, The Super-Kamiokande detector, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 501, 2-3, pp. 418-462, (2003); IEEE Trans Nucl Scie, (2010); Geant Detector Description and Simulation Tool, (2025); undefined, (2004); undefined, (1997); Abe, Ko, Calibration of the Super-Kamiokande detector, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 737, pp. 253-272, (2014); Prog Theor Exp Phys; Suzuki, T., Total nuclear capture rates for negative muons, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 35, 6, pp. 2212-2224, (1987)","","Sissa Medialab Srl","","37th International Cosmic Ray Conference, ICRC 2021","","Virtual, Berlin","177942","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145008025"

It is sensitive to neutrinos with energies ranging from 4.5 MeV to several TeV. A new framework has been developed for the follow-up of gravitational wave (GW) alerts issued by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration (LVC). Neutrinos are searched for, using a 1000-second time window centered on the alert time and in both SK low-energy and high-energy samples. Such observation can then be used to constrain the neutrino emission from the GW source. The significance of potential signals has been obtained by comparing neutrino direction with the localization of the GW. The computation of limits on incoming neutrino flux and on the total energy emitted in neutrinos by the source has been performed for the different neutrino flavors. The results using the LVC GWTC-2 catalog (covering O3a period) are presented, as well as the outlooks for the future real-time public release of follow-ups for the O4 period (in 2022) and beyond. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cosmic Rays; Cosmology; Gravitational Effects; Neutrons; Particle Detectors; Photomultipliers; Energy; Follow Up; Gravitational-waves; Low-high; Lower Energies; Neutrino Emission; Photo-multiplier; Potential Signal; Time Windows; Water Cherenkov Detectors; Gravity Waves","Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Gravitational effects; Neutrons; Particle detectors; Photomultipliers; Energy; Follow up; Gravitational-waves; Low-high; Lower energies; Neutrino emission; Photo-multiplier; Potential signal; Time windows; Water Cherenkov detectors; Gravity waves","","","Funding text 1: The work of the presenter has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 754496.

We aimed to investigate the use of holding regimens for PLWH in Asian countries. Data from adults enrolled in routine HIV care in IeDEA Asia-Pacific cohorts were included. Individuals were considered to be on holding regimen if they had been on combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months, had two confirmed viral loads (VL) ≥1000 copies/mL, and had remained on the same medications for at least 6 months. Survival time was analyzed using Fine and Gray's competing risk regression. Factors associated with CD4 changes and VL <1000 copies/mL were analyzed using linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. A total of 425 PLWH (72.9% male; 45.2% high-income and 54.8% low-to-middle-income country) met criteria for being on a holding regimen. From high-income countries, 63.0% were on protease inhibitors (PIs); from low-to-middle-income countries, 58.4% were on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs); overall, 4.5% were on integrase inhibitors. The combination of lamivudine, zidovudine, and efavirenz was the most commonly used single regimen (n = 46, 10.8%), followed by lamivudine, zidovudine, and nevirapine (n = 37, 8.7%). Forty-one PLWH (9.7%) died during follow-up (mortality rate 2.0 per 100 person-years). Age >50 years compared to age 31-40 years (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 3.29, 95% CI 1.45-7.43, p = 0.004), and VL ≥1000 copies/ml compared to VL <1000 copies/mL (SHR, 2.14, 95% CI 1.08-4.25, p = 0.029) were associated with increased mortality, while higher CD4 counts were protective. In our Asia regional cohort, there was a diversity of holding regimens, and the patterns of PI vs. NNRTI use differed by country income levels. Considering the high mortality rate of PLWH with holding regimen, efforts to extend accessibility to additional antiretroviral options are needed in our region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Didanosine; Efavirenz; Emtricitabine Plus Tenofovir Disoproxil; Indinavir; Lamivudine; Lamivudine Plus Zidovudine; Lopinavir Plus Ritonavir; Proteinase Inhibitor; Stavudine; Zidovudine; Anti-hiv Agents; Lamivudine; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Zidovudine; Atazanavir Plus Ritonavir; Cd4 Antigen; Didanosine; Efavirenz; Efavirenz Plus Lamivudine Plus Tenofovir Disoproxil; Efavirenz Plus Lamivudine Plus Zidovudine; Emtricitabine Plus Tenofovir Disoproxil; Indinavir; Integrase Inhibitor; Lamivudine; Lamivudine Plus Nevirapine Plus Stavudine; Lamivudine Plus Nevirapine Plus Zidovudine; Lamivudine Plus Tenofovir Disoproxil; Lamivudine Plus Zidovudine; Lopinavir Plus Ritonavir; Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor; Proteinase Inhibitor; Rna Directed Dna Polymerase Inhibitor; Stavudine; Zidovudine; Anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus Agent; Adult; Age Distribution; Antiretroviral Therapy; Article; Asia; Asian; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Analysis; Combination Drug Therapy; Confidence Interval; Controlled Study; Female; Fine And Gray Competing Risk Regression; Follow Up; Hazard Ratio; High Income Country; Holding Regimen; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Linear Regression Analysis; Logistic Regression Analysis; Low Income Country; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Income Country; Mortality Rate; Patient Care; Prognosis; Regression Analysis; Survival Time; Treatment Duration; Virus Load; Middle Aged; Adult; Anti-hiv Agents; Female; Hiv Infections; Humans; Lamivudine; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Viral Load; Zidovudine","atazanavir plus ritonavir; CD4 antigen; didanosine; efavirenz; efavirenz plus lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil; efavirenz plus lamivudine plus zidovudine; emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; indinavir; integrase inhibitor; lamivudine; lamivudine plus nevirapine plus stavudine; lamivudine plus nevirapine plus zidovudine; lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil; lamivudine plus zidovudine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; proteinase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; stavudine; zidovudine; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; age distribution; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Asia; Asian; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; confidence interval; controlled study; female; Fine and Gray competing risk regression; follow up; hazard ratio; high income country; holding regimen; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; linear regression analysis; logistic regression analysis; low income country; major clinical study; male; middle income country; mortality rate; patient care; prognosis; regression analysis; survival time; treatment duration; virus load; middle aged; Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Lamivudine; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Viral Load; Zidovudine","","didanosine, 69655-05-6; efavirenz, 154598-52-4; emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 731772-45-5; indinavir, 150378-17-9, 157810-81-6, 180683-37-8; lamivudine, 134678-17-4, 134680-32-3; lamivudine plus zidovudine, 165456-81-5; lopinavir plus ritonavir, 369372-47-4; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; stavudine, 3056-17-5; zidovudine, 30516-87-1; Anti-HIV Agents; Lamivudine; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Zidovudine","The TAHOD and TAHOD-LITE studies are initiatives of TREAT Asia, a program of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, with support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the Fogarty International Center (IeDEA; U01AI069907).

Results show the emission factors for CH4 and N2O were 0.295 ± 0.078 g kg-1 volatile solids (VS) and 0.132 ± 0.136 g N2O-N kg-1 Ninitial, respectively. We monitored the total bacterial/archaeal community using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and measured the abundance of functional genes required for methanogenesis (mcrA), nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (nirK, nirS and nosZ) processes. Methane emission occurred only at the beginning of the drying process (days 1 to 3). The results of amplicon sequencing indicated that the relative abundance of methanogens also decreased during this period. Although some nitrification activity was detected, there was no significant N2O emission. These findings well describe the manure management system in south Vietnam and the GHG emission from this manure category, paving the way for higher Tier estimations using country-specific values. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Rna 16s; Amoa Gene; Amplicon; Article; Beef Cattle; Cattle Manure; Chemical Analysis; Controlled Study; Denitrification; Dna Extraction; Gene; Greenhouse Gas; Mcra Gene; Methane Emission; Methanogenesis; Microbial Community; Nirk Gene; Nirs Gene; Nitrification; Nonhuman; Nosz Gene; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Population Abundance; Quantitative Analysis; Rna Sequencing; Viet Nam; Animal; Bovine; Genetics; Manure; Microflora; Animals; Cattle; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Microbiota; Nitrous Oxide; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Vietnam","methane; nitrous oxide; RNA 16S; amoA gene; amplicon; Article; beef cattle; cattle manure; chemical analysis; controlled study; denitrification; DNA extraction; gene; greenhouse gas; mcrA gene; methane emission; methanogenesis; microbial community; nirK gene; nirS gene; nitrification; nonhuman; nosZ gene; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; quantitative analysis; RNA sequencing; Viet Nam; animal; bovine; genetics; manure; microflora; Animals; Cattle; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Microbiota; Nitrous Oxide; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Vietnam","","methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S","","McDermott, John J., Sustaining intensification of smallholder livestock systems in the tropics, Livestock Science, 130, 1-3, pp. 95-109, (2010); Faostat, (2020); Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam, (2018); Leip, Adrian, Impacts of European livestock production: Nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus and greenhouse gas emissions, land-use, water eutrophication and biodiversity, Environmental Research Letters, 10, 11, (2015); Maeda, Koki, Microbiology of nitrogen cycle in animal manure compost, Microbial Biotechnology, 4, 6, pp. 700-709, (2011); Dangal, Shree R.S., Methane emission from global livestock sector during 1890–2014: Magnitude, trends and spatiotemporal patterns, Global Change Biology, 23, 10, pp. 4147-4161, (2017); Caro, Dario, Global and regional trends in greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, Climatic Change, 126, 1-2, pp. 203-216, (2014); Conrad, Ralf, Importance of hydrogenotrophic, aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogenesis for methane production in terrestrial, aquatic and other anoxic environments: A mini review, Pedosphere, 30, 1, pp. 25-39, (2020); de la Fuente, Gabriel, Methanogenesis in animals with foregut and hindgut fermentation: A review, Animal Production Science, 59, 12, pp. 2109-2122, (2019); St-Pierre, Benoit, Metagenomic analysis of methanogen populations in three full-scale mesophilic anaerobic manure digesters operated on dairy farms in Vermont, USA, Bioresource Technology, 138, pp. 277-284, (2013)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","35294462","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126705231"

However, miniature featherwing beetles can fly at speeds and accelerations of insects three times their size2. Here we show that this performance results from a reduced wing mass and a previously unknown type of wing-motion cycle. Our experiment combines three-dimensional reconstructions of morphology and kinematics in one of the smallest insects, the beetle Paratuposa placentis (body length 395 μm). The flapping bristled wings follow a pronounced figure-of-eight loop that consists of subperpendicular up and down strokes followed by claps at stroke reversals above and below the body. The elytra act as inertial brakes that prevent excessive body oscillation. Computational analyses suggest functional decomposition of the wingbeat cycle into two power half strokes, which produce a large upward force, and two down-dragging recovery half strokes. In contrast to heavier membranous wings, the motion of bristled wings of the same size requires little inertial power. Muscle mechanical power requirements thus remain positive throughout the wingbeat cycle, making elastic energy storage obsolete. These adaptations help to explain how extremely small insects have preserved good aerial performance during miniaturization, one of the factors of their evolutionary success. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Beetle; Body Size; Decomposition; Energy Storage; Experimental Study; Flight Activity; Kinematics; Muscle; Wing Morphology; Animal Structures; Article; Computer Model; Evolutionary Adaptation; Nonhuman; Three-dimensional Imaging; Wing; Anatomy And Histology; Animal; Biomechanics; Flying; Physiology; Ultrastructure; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Coleoptera; Flight, Animal; Wings, Animal","beetle; body size; decomposition; energy storage; experimental study; flight activity; kinematics; muscle; wing morphology; animal structures; Article; computer model; evolutionary adaptation; nonhuman; three-dimensional imaging; wing; anatomy and histology; animal; biomechanics; flying; physiology; ultrastructure; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Coleoptera; Flight, Animal; Wings, Animal","","","Funding text 1: A.A.P. thanks R.

The developed phase field model is validated by comparing simulated results and available experiment data. Via phase field simulations, effects of gradient index on polarization field and electromechanical response are systematically investigated. Anomalously large electromechanical responses are explored in nonlinearly graded ferroelectric thin films made of Ba (Formula presented.) Sr<inf>x</inf>TiO<inf>3</inf>, where SrTiO<inf>3</inf> mole fraction varies across the film thickness according to power-law relationships. In addition, a large gradient of polarization can be stabilized in graded ferroelectric thin films, where both magnitude and gradient of polarization can be manipulated by controlling the gradient index of thin films. The remarkable enhancement of electromechanical properties originates from the large gradient of polarization in thin films, which makes the polarization field more susceptible to external excitation. An optimal gradient index for maximizing the electromechanical response is also identified. Furthermore, a consideration of energy properties of graded thin films suggests that both energy storage density and charge–discharge efficiency increase with increasing gradient index of thin films. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electromechanical Response; Lead-free Ferroelectrics; Nonlinearly Graded Ferroelectrics; Phase Field Model; Polarization Gradient; Digital Storage; Ferroelectricity; Polarization; Strontium Titanates; Titanium Compounds; Electromechanical Property; Electromechanical Response; Ferroelectric Thin-films; Gradient-index; Lead-free Ferroelectrics; Nonlinearly Graded Ferroelectric; Phase Field Models; Polarization Field; Polarization Gradients; Thin-films; Ferroelectric Thin Films","Digital storage; Ferroelectricity; Polarization; Strontium titanates; Titanium compounds; Electromechanical property; Electromechanical response; Ferroelectric thin-films; Gradient-index; Lead-free ferroelectrics; Nonlinearly graded ferroelectric; Phase field models; Polarization field; Polarization gradients; Thin-films; Ferroelectric thin films","","","","undefined, (2021); Scott, James F., Applications of modern ferroelectrics, Science, 315, 5814, pp. 954-959, (2007); Fu, Huaxiang, Polarization rotation mechanism for ultrahigh electromechanical response in single-crystal piezoelectrics, Nature, 403, 6767, pp. 281-283, (2000); Zhang, Shujun, Advantages and challenges of relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric crystals for electroacoustic transducers - A review, Progress in Materials Science, 68, pp. 1-66, (2015); Saito, Yasuyoshi, Lead-free piezoceramics, Nature, 432, 7013, pp. 84-87, (2004); Liu, Wenfeng, Large piezoelectric effect in Pb-free ceramics, Physical Review Letters, 103, 25, (2009); Acosta, Matias, BaTiO3-based piezoelectrics: Fundamentals, current status, and perspectives, Applied Physics Reviews, 4, 4, (2017); Koehler, Melanie, Molecular insights into receptor binding energetics and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Nat Commun, (2017); Ahart, Muhtar, Origin of morphotropic phase boundaries in ferroelectrics, Nature, 451, 7178, pp. 545-548, (2008)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","25130390","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119834014"

The removal efficiency could be achieved up to 80% for coarse particles and approximately 10% higher for fine particles. To enhance particle removal efficiency, we designed ventilation ducts with baffles to compare their particle removal performance to that of prior ventilation ducts without baffle. Three different designs were generated, one model with two baffles and two models with four baffles, which were also compared the effects on the particle transport mechanisms. When comparing the effectiveness of particle removal by using the simulated results, we found that vertical ventilation ducts with baffles increased particle deposition and reduced particle escape compared to duct without baffle.

Although the influence of aging on features of asphalt mixture using traditional polymer additives has been relatively elucidated, the research on mixtures using recycling Polyethylene (rPE) additives has been an ongoing topic. This study investigated the influence of the long-term oven (LTOA) and short-term oven (STOA) on the dynamic modulus of asphalt mixtures. rPE was formulated by adding 0.6% to aggregates using the dry process. The control mixtures used different binders, including 60/70 penetration grade and styren- butadien-styren modified binder (PMB). After mixing, the loose mixtures were short-term aged for 4 hours at 135 °C, following long-term aged for 5 days at 95 °C. The results showed that, the dynamic modulus |E*| of STOA asphalt concrete mixtures was lower than that of LTOA asphalt concrete mixtures. When compared with rPE and PMB mixtures, virgin mixtures changed more significantly in LTOA. Moreover, rPE and PMB modified mixtures have lower |E*|LTOA/|E*|STOA ratios compared with virgin mixtures. Dynamic modulus of rPE mixtures in both STOA and LTOA was almost equivalent to PMB mixtures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Modulus; Recycling Polyethylene; Short-term Aging; Long- Term Aging; Additives; Asphalt Concrete; Binders; Concrete Mixtures; Ovens; Plastic Recycling; Polyethylenes; Asphalt Concrete Mixtures; Dynamic Moduli; Long-term Aging; Pavement Industry; Plastic Industry; Recycled Polyethylene; Recycling Polyethylene; Recycling Wastes; Short-term Aging;; Waste Plastic; Mixtures","Additives; Asphalt concrete; Binders; Concrete mixtures; Ovens; Plastic recycling; Polyethylenes; Asphalt concrete mixtures; Dynamic moduli; Long-term aging; Pavement industry; Plastic industry; Recycled polyethylene; Recycling polyethylene; Recycling wastes; Short-term aging;; Waste plastic; Mixtures","","","","Lebreton, Laurent C.M., Future scenarios of global plastic waste generation and disposal, Palgrave Communications, 5, 1, (2019); Cruz Sanchez, Fabio Alberto, Plastic recycling in additive manufacturing: A systematic literature review and opportunities for the circular economy, Journal of Cleaner Production, 264, (2020); Gu, Lei, Use of recycled plastics in concrete: A critical review, Waste Management, 51, pp. 19-42, (2016); Rigamonti, Lucia, Environmental evaluation of plastic waste management scenarios, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 85, pp. 42-53, (2014); Leal Filho, Walter, An overview of the problems posed by plastic products and the role of extended producer responsibility in Europe, Journal of Cleaner Production, 214, pp. 550-558, (2019); Ismail, Zainab Z., Use of waste plastic in concrete mixture as aggregate replacement, Waste Management, 28, 11, pp. 2041-2047, (2008); Anuar Sharuddin, Shafferina Dayana, A review on pyrolysis of plastic wastes, Energy Conversion and Management, 115, pp. 308-326, (2016); Adyel, Tanveer Mehedi, Accumulation of plastic waste during COVID-19, Science, 369, 6509, pp. 1314-1315, (2020); Ru, Jiakang, Microbial Degradation and Valorization of Plastic Wastes, Frontiers in Microbiology, 11, (2020); Ali, Sameh Samir, Plastic wastes biodegradation: Mechanisms, challenges and future prospects, Science of the Total Environment, 780, (2021)","","Tamkang University","","","","","","27089975; 27089967","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128199991"

In addition, due to the depletion of sources, saline sand (sea sand) has been used as a fine aggregate for conventional concrete and fine-grained concrete. This study investigates the effects of fine aggregate replacement with FA and GGBS incorporated saline sand on the mechanical properties and durability of concrete. In this study, five types of concrete mixtures were prepared with different proportions of cement, FA, and GGBS for the specimens in the laboratory, while two of them were used at the site for a breakwater structure under natural marine environment. The compression test, splitting tensile test, and chloride penetration test were conducted on the specimen in the laboratory at the ages of 3, 7, and 28 days, while the site samples for compression test and carbonation tests were conducted at 812 days. The laboratory results showed that the concrete mixture with the highest content (250 kg/m3) of GGBS has the best performance in compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and resistance to chloride ion penetrability; whereas, the mixture with the lowest GGBS content (105 kg/m3) has the worst performance.

The results of this study on improving them with local cement showed that the reinforced soil samples had initially increased until 28 days of age and then decreased with curing time. Additives play an important role in soil improvement with cement. They can change the hydrological environment making the soil reinforced better.

This study aimed to describe the level of awareness and preparedness of hospital HCWs at the time of the first wave. Methods This multinational, multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted among hospital HCWs from February to May 2020. We used a hierarchical logistic regression multivariate analysis to adjust the influence of variables based on awareness and preparedness. We then used association rule mining to identify relationships between HCW confidence in handling suspected COVID-19 patients and prior COVID-19 case-management training. Results We surveyed 24,653 HCWs from 371 hospitals across 57 countries and received 17,302 responses from 70.2% HCWs overall. The median COVID-19 preparedness score was 11.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 6.0-14.0) and the median awareness score was 29.6 (IQR = 26.6-32.6). HCWs at COVID-19 designated facilities with previous outbreak experience, or HCWs who were trained for dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, had significantly higher levels of preparedness and awareness (p<0.001). Association rule mining suggests that nurses and doctors who had a 'great-extent-of-confidence' in handling suspected COVID- 19 patients had participated in COVID-19 training courses. Male participants (mean difference = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.22, 0.46; p<0.001) and nurses (mean difference = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.53, 0.81; p<0.001) had higher preparedness scores compared to women participants and doctors. Interpretation There was an unsurprising high level of awareness and preparedness among HCWs who participated in COVID-19 training courses. However, disparity existed along the lines of gender and type of HCW. It is unknown whether the difference in COVID-19 preparedness that we detected early in the pandemic may have translated into disproportionate SARSCoV- 2 burden of disease by gender or HCW type. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access To Information; Adult; Africa South Of The Sahara; Article; Asia; Awareness; Caribbean; Case Management; Central Asia; Continuing Education; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Cross-sectional Study; Europe; Health Care Facility; Health Personnel Attitude; Hospital Department; Human; Job Experience; Middle East; Normal Human; North Africa; North America; Nurse Attitude; Pandemic; Patient Care; Pharmacist Attitude; Physician Attitude; Professional Competence; Questionnaire; Sex Difference; South And Central America; South Asia; Staff Training; Workplace; Attitude To Health; Clinical Trial; Epidemiology; Female; Hospital Personnel; Male; Medical Education; Multicenter Study; Prevention And Control; Socioeconomics; Adult; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Education, Medical, Continuing; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Personnel, Hospital; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys And Questionnaires","access to information; adult; Africa south of the Sahara; Article; Asia; awareness; Caribbean; case management; central Asia; continuing education; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; Europe; health care facility; health personnel attitude; hospital department; human; job experience; Middle East; normal human; North Africa; North America; nurse attitude; pandemic; patient care; pharmacist attitude; physician attitude; professional competence; questionnaire; sex difference; South and Central America; South Asia; staff training; workplace; attitude to health; clinical trial; epidemiology; female; hospital personnel; male; medical education; multicenter study; prevention and control; socioeconomics; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Medical, Continuing; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Personnel, Hospital; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","Wu, Yuntao, SARS-CoV-2 is an appropriate name for the new coronavirus, The Lancet, 395, 10228, pp. 949-950, (2020); Sanche, Steven E., RESEARCH High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 26, 7, pp. 1470-1477, (2020); Remuzzi, Andrea, COVID-19 and Italy: what next?, The Lancet, 395, 10231, pp. 1225-1228, (2020); Morens, David Michael, Escaping Pandora's box - Another novel coronavirus, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 14, pp. 1293-1295, (2020); Wu, Zunyou, Characteristics of and Important Lessons from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72314 Cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, JAMA, 323, 13, pp. 1239-1242, (2020); Livingston, Edward H., Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy, JAMA, 323, 14, (2020); Covid Data Tracker Cases Deaths Among Healthcare Personnel, (2021); Sasangohar, Farzan, Provider burnout and fatigue during the COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons learned from a high-volume intensive care unit, Anesthesia and Analgesia, 131, 1, pp. 106-111, (2020); O’Toole, Áine Niamh, Assignment of epidemiological lineages in an emerging pandemic using the pangolin tool, Virus Evolution, 7, 2, (2021); Healthcare Professional Preparedness Checklist for Transport and Arrival of Patients with Confirmed or Possible Covid 19, (2020)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","34936646","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122045142"

This review provides a comprehensive overview of questionnaire- related dengue studies conducted in the Philippines and evaluates their reliability and validity in these surveys. Methods A review protocol constructed by a panel of experienced academic reviewers was used to formulate the methodology, research design, search strategy and selection criteria. An extensive literature search was conducted between March-June 2020 in various major electronic biomedical databases including PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. A systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) were selected as the preferred item reporting method. Results Out of a total of 34 peer-reviewed dengue-related KAP studies that were identified, 15 published from 2000 to April 2020 met the inclusion criteria. Based on the meta-analysis, a poor mean score was obtained for each of knowledge (68.89), attitude (49.86) and preventive practice (64.69). Most respondents were equipped with a good knowledge of the major clinical signs of dengue. Worryingly, 95% of respondents showed several negative attitudes towards dengue prevention, claiming that this was not possible and that enacting preventive practices was not their responsibility. Interestingly, television or radio was claimed as the main source of gaining dengue information (range 50-95%). Lastly, only five articles (33.3%) piloted or pretested their questionnaire before surveying, of which three reported Cronbach's alpha coefficient (range 0.70 to 0.90). Conclusion This review indicates that to combat the growing public health threat of dengue to the Philippines, we need the active participation of resident communities, full engagement of healthcare personnel, promotion of awareness campaigns, and access to safe complementary and alternative medicines. Importantly, the psychometric properties of each questionnaire should be assessed rigorously. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Attitude To Health; Dengue; Health Survey; Human; Methodology; Personal Experience; Philippines; Questionnaire; Scoring System; Systematic Review; Validity; Dengue Virus; Epidemiology; Health Care Personnel; Health Services Research; Isolation And Purification; Meta Analysis; Psychology; Reproducibility; Virology; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Health Services Research; Humans; Reproducibility Of Results; Surveys And Questionnaires","Article; attitude to health; dengue; health survey; human; methodology; personal experience; Philippines; questionnaire; scoring system; systematic review; validity; Dengue virus; epidemiology; health care personnel; health services research; isolation and purification; meta analysis; psychology; reproducibility; virology; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Health Services Research; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","Franklinos, Lydia H.V., The effect of global change on mosquito-borne disease, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 19, 9, pp. e302-e312, (2019); Gyawali, Narayan, The epidemiology of dengue infection: Harnessing past experience and current knowledge to support implementation of future control strategies, Journal of Vector Borne Diseases, 53, 4, pp. 293-304, (2016); Bhatt, S.

To identify the sentiment-return nexus, we use the OLS models with Newey-West standard errors as well as the panel regressions with cross-country fixed effects and time dummies. We report the regional outcomes for Asia, Europe, and the individual markets. Our empirical results reveal a significant effect of sentiment on stock returns, although those effects are nonidentical across markets. We find the dissimilarities in the sentiment-return relationship among the sample markets are driven negatively by almost all national factors, with the strongest determinants being the development of financial institutions and the quality of regulation. The impact of cultural dimensions among the sample markets, on the contrary, is relatively weak and mixed. Our research is the first to compare Asian and European outcomes and reveal which region is more vulnerable to the influence of the local components. We detect that, except cultural aspects, European markets are more sensitive to country-specific characteristics than Asian ones. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia Vs.

Our aim is to estimate weather-dependent signatures in the early phase of the pandemic, while controlling for socio-economic factors and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identify a modest non-linear association between mean temperature and the effective reproduction number (R<inf>e</inf>) in 409 cities in 26 countries, with a decrease of 0.087 (95% CI: 0.025; 0.148) for a 10 °C increase. Early interventions have a greater effect on R<inf>e</inf> with a decrease of 0.285 (95% CI 0.223; 0.347) for a 5th - 95th percentile increase in the government response index. The variation in the effective reproduction number explained by government interventions is 6 times greater than for mean temperature.

The aim of the analysis is to test the “two-layer” model of human dispersal in eastern Eurasia, using previously unanalysed female remains to balance the large sample of previously-analysed males. The resulting craniometric data indicate that the examined specimens all belong to the “first layer” of dispersal, and share a common ancestor with recent Australian and Papuan populations, and the ancient Jomon people of Japan. The analysed specimens pre-date the expansion of agricultural populations of East/Northeast Asian origin—that is, the “second layer” of human dispersal proposed by the model. As a result of this study, the two-layer model, which has hitherto rested on evidence only from male skeletons, is now strongly supported by female-derived data. Further comparisons reveal that the people of the first layer were closer in terms of their facial morphology to modern Africans and Sri Lankan Veddah than to modern Asians and Europeans, suggesting that the Late Pleistocene through Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers examined in this study were direct descendants of the anatomically modern humans who first migrated out of Africa through southern Eurasia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Africa; African; Article; Asian; China; Controlled Study; Craniometry; European; Face; Female; Holocene; Human; Human Tissue; Hunter-gatherer; Japan; Male; Progeny; Skeleton; Taiwan; Upper Pleistocene; Viet Nam; Anatomy And Histology; Archeology; Cephalometry; Migration; Skull; Archaeology; Cephalometry; Female; Human Migration; Humans; Male; Skull; Vietnam","adult; Africa; African; article; Asian; China; controlled study; craniometry; European; face; female; Holocene; human; human tissue; hunter-gatherer; Japan; male; progeny; skeleton; Taiwan; Upper Pleistocene; Viet Nam; anatomy and histology; archeology; cephalometry; migration; skull; Archaeology; Cephalometry; Female; Human Migration; Humans; Male; Skull; Vietnam","","","This study was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JPS 16H02527) to Hirofumi Matsumura, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877427) to Guangmao Xie, and the Australian Research Council (DP 150104458 and DP190101839) to Hsiao-chun Hung.","Matsumura, Hirofumi, Craniometrics Reveal “Two Layers” of Prehistoric Human Dispersal in Eastern Eurasia, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Genetic Linguistic and Archaeological Perspectives on Human Diversity in Southeast Asia, (2001); Chi, Zhang, The emergence of agriculture in southern China, Antiquity, 84, 323, pp. 11-25, (2010); First Migrants, (2013); Global Prehistory of Human Migration, (2015); Turner, Christy G., Major features of Sundadonty and Sinodonty, including suggestions about East Asian microevolution, population history, and late Pleistocene relationships with Australian Aboriginals, American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 82, 3, pp. 295-317, (1990); Pietrusewsky, Michael, A multivariate craniometric study of the inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands and comparisons with cranial series from Japan, Asia, and the Pacific, Anthropological Science, 107, 4, pp. 255-281, (1999); Hanihara, Tsunehiko, Craniofacial continuity and discontinuity of Far Easterners in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, Journal of Human Evolution, 27, 5, pp. 417-441, (1994); Human Osteology, (2000); Wu, Yan, Phytolith evidence for human-plant subsistence in Yahuai Cave (Guangxi, South China) over the past 30000 years, Science China Earth Sciences, 63, 11, pp. 1745-1757, (2020)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","34675295","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117684548"

Semi-comprehensive NATs such as pan-flavivirus PCR which covers genus Flavivirus are also available; however, further specification by sequencing is required for species level differentiation. In this study, a semi-comprehensive detection system that allows species differentiation of flaviviruses was developed by integration of the pan-flavivirus PCR and Nanopore sequencing. In addition, a multiplexing method was established by adding index sequences through the PCR with a streamlined bioinformatics pipeline. This enables defining cut-off values for observed read counts. In the laboratory setting, this approach allowed the detection of up to nine different flaviviruses. Using clinical samples collected in Vietnam and Brazil, seven different flaviviruses were also detected. When compared to a commercial NAT, the sensitivity and specificity of our system were 66.7% and 95.4%, respectively. Conversely, when compared to our system, the sensitivity and specificity of the commercial NAT were 57.1% and 96.9%, respectively. In addition, Nanopore sequencing detected more positive samples (n = 8) compared to the commercial NAT (n = 6). Collectively, our study has established a semi-comprehensive sequencing-based diagnostic system for the detection of flaviviruses at extremely affordable costs, considerable sensitivity, and only requires simple experimental methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biology; Brazil; Flavivirus; Flavivirus Infection; Genetics; Human; Isolation And Purification; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Procedures; Sensitivity And Specificity; Viet Nam; Virology; Computational Biology; Flavivirus Infections; Humans; Nanopore Sequencing; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity And Specificity; Vietnam","biology; Brazil; Flavivirus; Flavivirus infection; genetics; human; isolation and purification; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; Viet Nam; virology; Computational Biology; Flavivirus Infections; Humans; Nanopore Sequencing; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vietnam","","","This work was supported by The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Core-to-Core Program, B.

Although HS induces HSP70 expression to confer stress resistance to cells, HS causes cell toxicity by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Recently, a standardized extract of Asparagus officinalis stem (EAS), produced from the byproduct of asparagus, has been shown to induce HSP70 expression without HS and regulate cellular redox balance in pheochromocytoma cells. However, the effects of EAS on reproductive cell function remain unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of EAS on HSP70 induction and oxidative redox balance in cultured bovine cumulus-granulosa (CG) cells. EAS significantly increased HSP70 expression; however, no effect was observed on HSP27 and HSP90 under non-HS conditions. EAS decreased ROS generation and DNA damage and increased glutathione (GSH) synthesis under both non-HS and HS conditions. Moreover, EAS synergistically increased HSP70 and HSF1 expression and increased progesterone levels in CG cells. Treatment with an HSP70 inhibitor significantly decreased GSH level, increased ROS level, and decreased HSF1, Nrf2, and Keap1 expression in the presence of EAS. Furthermore, EAS significantly increased progesterone synthesis. Thus, EAS improves HSP70-mediated redox balance and cell function in bovine CG cells. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glutathione; Progesterone; Glutathione; Hsp70 Heat-shock Proteins; Plant Extracts; Progesterone; Reactive Oxygen Species; Glutathione; Heat Shock Protein 70; Plant Extract; Progesterone; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Animal; Asparagus; Biosynthesis; Bovine; Chemistry; Cumulus Cell; Cytology; Dna Damage; Drug Effect; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Heat Shock Response; Metabolism; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Oxidative Stress; Plant Stem; Standard; Animals; Asparagus Plant; Cattle; Cumulus Cells; Dna Damage; Gene Expression Regulation; Glutathione; Heat-shock Response; Hsp70 Heat-shock Proteins; Oxidation-reduction; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Plant Stems; Progesterone; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reference Standards","glutathione; heat shock protein 70; plant extract; progesterone; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal; asparagus; biosynthesis; bovine; chemistry; cumulus cell; cytology; DNA damage; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; heat shock response; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; plant stem; standard; Animals; Asparagus Plant; Cattle; Cumulus Cells; DNA Damage; Gene Expression Regulation; Glutathione; Heat-Shock Response; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Plant Stems; Progesterone; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reference Standards","","glutathione, 70-18-8; progesterone, 57-83-0; Glutathione; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Plant Extracts; Progesterone; Reactive Oxygen Species","This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Tojuro Iijima Foundation for Food Science and Technology.

We have previously established a tumor spheroid-based assay that used gadolinium containing mesoporous silica nanoparticles and synchrotron-generated monochromatic X-rays. In this work, we focused on iodine and synthesized iodine-containing porous organosilica (IPO) nanoparticles. IPO were loaded onto tumor spheroids and the spheroids were irradiated with 33.2 keV monochromatic X-ray. After incubation in CO<inf>2</inf> incubator, destruction of tumor spheroids was observed which was accompanied by apoptosis induction, as determined by the TUNEL assay. By employing the γH2AX assay, we detected double strand DNA cleavages immediately after the irradiation. These results suggest that IPO first generate double strand DNA breaks upon X-ray irradiation followed by apoptosis induction of cancer cells. Use of three different monochromatic X-rays having energy levels of 33.0, 33.2 and 33.4 keV as well as X-rays with 0.1 keV energy intervals showed that the optimum effect of all three events (spheroid destruction, apoptosis induction and generation of double strand DNA breaks) occurred with a 33.2 keV monochromatic X-ray. These results uncover the preferential effect of K-edge energy X-ray for tumor spheroid destruction mediated by iodine containing nanoparticles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Iodine; Silicon Dioxide; Iodine; Organic Chemicals; Silicon Dioxide; Iodine; Nanoparticle; Organic Compound; Silicon Dioxide; Apoptosis; Chemistry; Dna Strand Breakage; Double Stranded Dna Break; Human; Multicellular Spheroid; Neoplasm; Pathology; Porosity; Radiation Response; Synthesis; Tumor Cell Line; Ultrastructure; X Ray; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Dna Breaks; Dna Breaks, Double-stranded; Humans; Iodine; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Organic Chemicals; Porosity; Silicon Dioxide; Spheroids, Cellular; X-rays","iodine; nanoparticle; organic compound; silicon dioxide; apoptosis; chemistry; DNA strand breakage; double stranded DNA break; human; multicellular spheroid; neoplasm; pathology; porosity; radiation response; synthesis; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; X ray; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Breaks; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Humans; Iodine; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Organic Chemicals; Porosity; Silicon Dioxide; Spheroids, Cellular; X-Rays","","iodine, 7553-56-2; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; Iodine; Organic Chemicals; Silicon Dioxide","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant nos.

The D. linearis-derived chars produced under pyrolysis at 400 °C for 1 h were activated in various CO<inf>2</inf>-steam proportions. As revealed by the IR and Raman spectra, the structure of the activated chars was heavily dependent on the relative proportion of CO<inf>2</inf> and steam. The total specific surface area (SSA) of the activated chars proportionally increased with the increase in steam proportion and was comparable to the values of commercial activated char products. Specifically, the activation under CO<inf>2</inf>− and steam-saturated conditions has correspondingly resulted in SSA increasing from 89 to 653 m2g−1 and from 89 to 1015 m2g−1.

We asked whether mobility restrictions were associated with changes in the occurrence of COVID-19 in 34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan. Our data sources were the Google Global Mobility Data Source, which reports different types of mobility, and COVID-19 cases retrieved from the dataset curated by Our World in Data. Beginning at each country’s 100th case, and incorporating a 14-day lag to account for the delay between exposure and illness, we examined the association between changes in mobility (with January 3 to February 6, 2020 as baseline) and the ratio of the number of newly confirmed cases on a given day to the total number of cases over the past 14 days from the index day (the potentially infective ‘pool’ in that population), per million population, using LOESS regression and logit regression. In two-thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased cases, especially early in the pandemic. Once both mobility and incidence had been brought down, further restrictions provided little additional benefit. These findings point to the importance of acting early and decisively in a pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Communicable Disease Control; Epidemiology; Human; Incidence; Pandemic; Prevention And Control; Traffic And Transport; Travel; Travel Related Disease; Workplace; Communicable Disease Control; Covid-19; Humans; Incidence; Pandemics; Transportation; Travel; Travel-related Illness; Workplace","communicable disease control; epidemiology; human; incidence; pandemic; prevention and control; traffic and transport; travel; travel related disease; workplace; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Incidence; Pandemics; Transportation; Travel; Travel-Related Illness; Workplace","","","","Dont Let Children Be the Hidden Victims of Covid 19 Pandemic, (2020); New York Times, (2020); Euronews, (2020); Woodworth, Max D., Exploring China’s borderlands in an era of BRI-induced change, Eurasian Geography and Economics, 61, 1, pp. 1-12, (2020); Rahman, Md Mokhlesur, COVID-19 pandemic severity, lockdown regimes, and people’s mobility: Early evidence from 88 countries, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 21, pp. 1-17, (2020); China S Coronavirus Lockdown Strategy Brutal but Effective the Guardian, (2020); Markel, Howard, Nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented by US cities during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, JAMA, 298, 6, pp. 644-654, (2007); Mwalili, Samuel Musili, SEIR model for COVID-19 dynamics incorporating the environment and social distancing, BMC Research Notes, 13, 1, (2020); Mahase, Elisabeth, Covid-19: Physical distancing of at least one metre is linked to large reduction in infection, BMJ, 369, (2020); Hsiang, Solomon M., The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature, 584, 7820, pp. 262-267, (2020)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","34215764","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109155202"

Here, we demonstrate that ATF6β is highly expressed in the hippocampus of the brain, and specifically regulates the expression of calreticulin (CRT), a molecular chaperone in the ER with a high Ca2+-binding capacity. CRT expression was reduced to ~ 50% in the CNS of Atf6b−/− mice under both normal and ER stress conditions. Analysis using cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that ATF6β deficiency reduced Ca2+ stores in the ER and enhanced ER stress-induced death. The higher levels of death in Atf6b−/− neurons were recovered by ATF6β and CRT overexpressions, or by treatment with Ca2+-modulating reagents such as BAPTA-AM and 2-APB, and with an ER stress inhibitor salubrinal. In vivo, kainate-induced neuronal death was enhanced in the hippocampi of Atf6b−/− and Calr+/− mice, and restored by administration of 2-APB and salubrinal. These results suggest that the ATF6β-CRT axis promotes neuronal survival under ER stress and excitotoxity by improving intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Kainic Acid; Activating Transcription Factor 6; Atf6b Protein, Mouse; Calreticulin; Kainic Acid; Activating Transcription Factor 6; Atf6b Protein, Mouse; Calreticulin; Kainic Acid; Animal; Brain; C57bl Mouse; Cell Death; Cell Survival; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Female; Hippocampus; Homeostasis; Male; Metabolism; Mouse; Nerve Cell; Physiology; Activating Transcription Factor 6; Animals; Brain; Calreticulin; Cell Death; Cell Survival; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Female; Hippocampus; Homeostasis; Kainic Acid; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57bl; Neurons","activating transcription factor 6; Atf6b protein, mouse; calreticulin; kainic acid; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; cell death; cell survival; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; female; hippocampus; homeostasis; male; metabolism; mouse; nerve cell; physiology; Activating Transcription Factor 6; Animals; Brain; Calreticulin; Cell Death; Cell Survival; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Female; Hippocampus; Homeostasis; Kainic Acid; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neurons","","kainic acid, 487-79-6; Activating Transcription Factor 6; Atf6b protein, mouse; Calreticulin; Kainic Acid","We are grateful to Dr. Marek Michalak (University of Alberta) for providing the CAT plasmid containing the mouse CRT promoters (pCC1, pCC3, and pCC5).

It is important to improve mental health among nurses in these countries. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of two types of newly developed smartphone-based stress management programs in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among hospital nurses in Vietnam. This study was a three-arm (including two intervention groups and one control group) randomized trial. Participants were recruited from nurses in a large general hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Two types (free-choice and fixed sequential order) of smartphone-based stress management programs were developed. Participants were randomly allocated to Program A (a free-choice, multimodule stress management), Program B (a fixed-order, internet cognitive behavioral therapy, iCBT), or a control group (treatment as usual). The depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales at baseline, 3-, and 7-month follow-up surveys. 951 participants were randomly allocated to each of the three groups. Program B showed a statistically significant effect on improving depressive symptoms at 3-month (p = 0.048), but not at 7-month (p = 0.92); Cohen’s d was − 0.18 (95% CI − 0.34 to − 0.02) and 0.03 (95% CI − 1.00 to 1.05), respectively. Program A failed to show a significant intervention effect on any of the outcomes at 3- or 7-month follow-up (p > 0.05). Despite the small effect size, the present fixed-order iCBT program seems effective in improving depression of hospital nurses in Vietnam. A public health impact of the intervention can be scalable, when considering its accessibility and minimal cost.

Based on analysis and age dating of four sediment cores, we show that the channel was active since 2.6 ka and was abandoned at 0.7 ka as marked by the abrupt disappearance of the sand fraction and increase in organic matter and sediment accumulation rate. We estimate that the channel might have been filled in a time range of 45–263 years after detachment from the deltaic network, with sediment accumulation rates of centimetres to decimetres per year, rapidly storing approximately 600 Mt of organic-rich mud. We suggest that the channel was abandoned due to a sediment buildup favoured by an increase in regional sediment supply to the delta. This study highlights that mechanisms for abandonment and infilling of tide-dominated deltaic channels do not entirely fit widely used models developed for fluvial-dominated environments. Their abandonment might be driven by autogenic factors related to the river-tidal and deltaic dynamics and favoured by allogenic factors (e.g., human impact and/or climate change). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the automatic production of the first Vietnam-wide annual land use/land cover (LULC) data sets (VLUCDs) from 1990 to 2020, using available remotely sensed and inventory data. Classification accuracies ranged from 85.7 ± 1.3 to 92.0 ± 1.2% with the primary dominant LULC and 77.6 ± 1.2% to 84.7 ± 1.1% with the secondary dominant LULC. This confirmed the potential of the proposed framework for systematically long-term monitoring LULC in Vietnam. Results reveal that despite slight recoveries in 2000 and 2010, the net loss of forests (19,940 km2) mainly transformed to croplands over 30 years. Meanwhile, productive croplands were converted to urban areas, which increased approximately ten times. A threefold increase in aquaculture was a major driver of the wetland loss (1914 km2). The spatial–temporal changes varied, but the most dynamic regions were the western north, the southern centre, and the south.

National representative samples were collected from 24 countries (N = 25,435). The main predictors were (1) perceived risk to contract coronavirus, (2) perceived risk to suffer economic losses due to coronavirus, and (3) their interaction effect. Individual and country-level variables were added as covariates in multilevel regression models. We examined compliance with various preventive health behaviors and support for strict containment policies. Results show that perceived economic risk consistently predicted mitigation behavior and policy support—and its effects were positive. Perceived health risk had mixed effects. Only two significant interactions between health and economic risk were identified—both positive. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Communicable Disease Control; Employment; Epidemiology; Health Behavior; Health Status; Human; Isolation And Purification; Pandemic; Perception; Prevention And Control; Risk; Work; Communicable Disease Control; Covid-19; Employment; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Pandemics; Perception; Risk; Sars-cov-2; Work","communicable disease control; employment; epidemiology; health behavior; health status; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; perception; prevention and control; risk; work; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Employment; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Pandemics; Perception; Risk; SARS-CoV-2; Work","","","This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75-71015—attributed to J.J.B.), the University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund—attributed to N.P.L), and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (COV20/00086), co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) “A way to make Europe.” (attributed to M.M.)","McKee, Martin J., If the world fails to protect the economy, COVID-19 will damage health not just now but also in the future, Nature Medicine, 26, 5, pp. 640-642, (2020); Cutler, David M., How Will COVID-19 Affect the Health Care Economy?, JAMA, 323, 22, pp. 2237-2238, (2020); Restarting the Economy While Saving Lives Under Covid 19, (2020); Risk Versus Risk Tradeoffs in Protecting Health and the Environment, (1995); Gregorian, Razmic S., Importance of side effects in opioid treatment: A trade-off analysis with patients and physicians, Journal of Pain, 11, 11, pp. 1095-1108, (2010); Coronavirus Economy Debate; Wakefield, Melanie A., Use of mass media campaigns to change health behaviour, The Lancet, 376, 9748, pp. 1261-1271, (2010); Vinck, Patrick, Institutional trust and misinformation in the response to the 2018–19 Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, DR Congo: a population-based survey, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 19, 5, pp. 529-536, (2019); Zingg, Walter, Hospital organisation, management, and structure for prevention of health-care-associated infection: A systematic review and expert consensus, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 15, 2, pp. 212-224, (2015); Dooley, David, Health and unemployment, Annual Review of Public Health, 17, pp. 449-465, (1996)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","33958617","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105459494"

When mothers were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)+, 28.3% of children have got infected even with complete HepB. HBV infection in mothers, hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs antibody) below the seroprotective level in children, and mothers with pre-pregnancy low body mass index were associated with HBV infection in children. Meanwhile, HBV infection in children, older maternal age, no or incomplete doses of HepB, and boys were associated with anti-HBs antibody below the seroprotective level in children.

Its graded stiffness, increasing from apex to the base of the cochlea provides the mechanical basis for sound frequency analysis. Despite its central role in auditory signal transduction, virtually nothing is known about the BM’s structural development. Using polarized light microscopy, the present study characterized the architectural transformations of freshly dissected BM at time points during postnatal development and maturation. The results indicate that the BM structural elements increase progressively in size, becoming radially aligned and more tightly packed with maturation and reach the adult structural signature by postnatal day 20 (P20). The findings provide insight into structural details and developmental changes of the mammalian BM, suggesting that BM is a dynamic structure that changes throughout the life of an animal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emilin2 Protein, Mouse; Glycoproteins; Emilin2 Protein, Mouse; Glycoprotein; Anatomy And Histology; Animal; Basilar Membrane; Birefringence; C57bl Mouse; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Hearing; Knockout Mouse; Mouse; Physiology; Sound; Animals; Basilar Membrane; Birefringence; Glycoproteins; Hearing; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57bl; Mice, Knockout; Sound","Emilin2 protein, mouse; glycoprotein; anatomy and histology; animal; basilar membrane; birefringence; C57BL mouse; genetics; growth, development and aging; hearing; knockout mouse; mouse; physiology; sound; Animals; Basilar Membrane; Birefringence; Glycoproteins; Hearing; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Sound","","Emilin2 protein, mouse; Glycoproteins","","Experiments in Hearing, (1960); Dallos, Peter J., Electrical correlates of mechanical events in the cochlea, International Journal of Audiology, 14, 5-6, pp. 408-418, (1975); Robles, Luis W., Mechanics of the mammalian cochlea, Physiological Reviews, 81, 3, pp. 1305-1352, (2001); Sumner, Christian J., Mammalian behavior and physiology converge to confirm sharper cochlear tuning in humans, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 115, 44, pp. 11322-11326, (2018); Nuttall, Alfred L., A mechanoelectrical mechanism for detection of sound envelopes in the hearing organ, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Cochlea, (1996); Goycoolea, Marcos V., Experimental studies on round window structure: Function and permeability, Laryngoscope, 98, 6, pp. 1-20, (1988); Keithley, Elizabeth M., Fibronectin‐like immunoreactivity of the basilar membrane of young and aged rats, Journal of Comparative Neurology, 327, 4, pp. 612-617, (1993); Iurato, Salvatore, Submicroscopic structure of the membranous labyrinth - III.

The compensation temperature is determined by the anomalous Hall measurement, and an application of 1.2% tensile strain reduces the compensation temperature by 12 K. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals that approximately 5% of Fe magnetic moment and approximately 1% of Tb magnetic moment are reduced by an application of 0.9% tensile strain at the room temperature. To understand the greater reduction in Fe magnetization compared with that in Tb and the compensation temperature reduction simultaneously, a model applying molecular field theory is analyzed. Changes in three types of exchange coupling between Fe and Tb atoms are speculated to be caused by the strain. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank M.

These diseases provide varying levels of resistance to malaria and are proposed to have emerged as an adaptive response to malaria in these regions. The transition to agriculture in the Holocene has been suggested to have influenced the selection for thalassemia in the Mediterranean as land clearance for farming encouraged interaction between Anopheles mosquitos, the vectors for malaria, and human groups. Here we document macroscopic and microscopic skeletal evidence for the presence of thalassemia in both hunter-gatherer (Con Co Ngua) and early agricultural (Man Bac) populations in northern Vietnam. Firstly, our findings demonstrate that thalassemia emerged prior to the transition to agriculture in Mainland Southeast Asia, from at least the early seventh millennium BP, contradicting a long-held assumption that agriculture was the main driver for an increase in malaria in Southeast Asia. Secondly, we describe evidence for significant malarial burden in the region during early agriculture. We argue that the introduction of farming into the region was not the initial driver of the selection for thalassemia, as it may have been in other regions of the world. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Agricultural Worker; Bone; Diagnostic Imaging; Epidemiology; Evolution; Geography; Human; Malaria; Pathology; Skull; Southeast Asia; Thalassemia; Adaptation, Physiological; Asia, Southeastern; Biological Evolution; Bone And Bones; Farmers; Geography; Humans; Malaria; Skull; Thalassemia","adaptation; agricultural worker; bone; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; evolution; geography; human; malaria; pathology; skull; Southeast Asia; thalassemia; Adaptation, Physiological; Asia, Southeastern; Biological Evolution; Bone and Bones; Farmers; Geography; Humans; Malaria; Skull; Thalassemia","","","","Encyclopedia of Archaeological Sciences, (2018); Weatherall, David J., Genetic variation and susceptibility to infection: The red cell and malaria, British Journal of Haematology, 141, 3, pp. 276-286, (2008); Weatherall, David J., The Evolving Spectrum of the Epidemiology of Thalassemia, Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America, 32, 2, pp. 165-175, (2018); Aydinok, Yeşim, Thalassemia, Hematology (United Kingdom), 17, SUPPL. 1, pp. S28-S31, (2012); Galanello, Renzo, Alpha-thalassemia, Genetics in Medicine, 13, 2, pp. 83-88, (2011); World Malaria Report 2019, (2019); Fucharoen, Suthat, Thalassemia in Southeast Asia: Problems and strategy for prevention and control, Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health, 23, 4, pp. 647-655, (1992); Vichinsky, Elliott P., Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia and thalassemia intermedia: Epidemiology, complications, and management, Current Medical Research and Opinion, 32, 1, pp. 191-204, (2016); Antonarakis, Stylianos E., Evidence for multiple origins of the β(E)-globin gene in Southeast Asia, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 79, 21 I, pp. 6608-6611, (1982); Fucharoen, Suthat, The hemoglobin E thalassemias, Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine, 2, 8, (2012)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","33707498","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102420371"

However, little is known about how preferred responses to norm violations vary across cultures and across domains. In a preregistered study of 57 countries (using convenience samples of 22,863 students and non-students), we measured perceptions of the appropriateness of various responses to a violation of a cooperative norm and to atypical social behaviors. Our findings highlight both cultural universals and cultural variation. We find a universal negative relation between appropriateness ratings of norm violations and appropriateness ratings of responses in the form of confrontation, social ostracism and gossip. Moreover, we find the country variation in the appropriateness of sanctions to be consistent across different norm violations but not across different sanctions. Specifically, in those countries where use of physical confrontation and social ostracism is rated as less appropriate, gossip is rated as more appropriate. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture; Detection Method; Perception; Social Behavior; Article; Convenience Sample; Human; Human Experiment; Major Clinical Study; Organization; Ostracism; Attention; Comprehension; Decision Making; Female; Interpersonal Communication; Male; Social Norm; Social Support; Socioeconomics; Violence; Attention; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Negotiating; Perception; Social Behavior; Social Norms; Social Support; Value Of Life; Violence","culture; detection method; perception; social behavior; article; convenience sample; human; human experiment; major clinical study; organization; ostracism; attention; comprehension; decision making; female; interpersonal communication; male; social norm; social support; socioeconomics; violence; Attention; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Negotiating; Perception; Social Behavior; Social Norms; Social Support; Value of Life; Violence","","","This research was funded by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond) [P17-0030:1].

Using hospital-based surveillance in children, we investigate the range of clinical severity for patients singly, multiply, and not infected with a group of commonly circulating viruses in Nha Trang, Vietnam. RT-PCR was performed to detect 13 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal samples from enrolled patients. We apply a novel clinical severity score and examine associations with the odds of being severe and differences in raw severity scores. We find no difference in severity between 0-, 1-, and 2-concurrent infections and little differences in severity between specific viruses. We find RSV and HMPV infections to be associated with 2- and 1.5-fold increase in odds of being severe, respectively, and that infection with ADV is consistently associated with lower risk of severity.

In this study, Vietnamese patient H. pylori samples (46 duodenal ulcer (DU), 51 non-cardia gastric cancer (NCGC), 39 chronic gastritis (CG)) were fully sequenced using next-generation sequencing and assembled into contigs. tfs3, tfs4, and cagPAI genes were compared with the public database. Most (94%) H. pylori strains possessed a complete cagPAI, which was the greatest risk factor for clinical outcomes, while the prevalences of tfs3 and tfs4 were 45% and 77%, respectively. Complete tfs3 and tfs4 were found in 18.3% and 17.6% of strains, respectively. The prevalence of H. pylori strains with complete tfs3 ICE in DU patients was significantly higher than that in NCGC patients (30.4% vs 11.7%, P < 0.05). In addition, the prevalence of strains with complete tfs3 ICE and cagPAI was significantly higher in DU patients than that in NCGC (28.4% vs 9.8%, P = 0.038) and CG patients (28.2% vs 7.7%, P = 0.024). cagPAI and complete tfs3 increased the risk of DU compared to NCGC (OR = 3.56, 95%CI: 1.1–14.1, P = 0.038) and CG (OR = 4.64, 95%CI: 1.1–27.6, P = 0.024). A complete cluster of tfs3 ICE was associated with gastroduodenal diseases in Vietnam. However, there was a low prevalence of the dupA/complete dupA cluster (15.4%) in the Vietnam strains. The prevalence of cagPAI in Vietnam strains was significantly higher than in US (P = 0.01) and Indonesia (P < 0.0001); the prevalence of the dupA cluster was also higher in the Vietnam strains than in the Indonesian strains (P < 0.05). In addition, the prevalence of ctkA, an accessory gene of tfs3, was significantly different between Vietnam and US strains (28% vs 2%, P = 0.0002). In summary, the acquisition of tfs3/4 ICE was common in H. pylori strains in patients with gastroduodenal disease in Vietnam, and the complete cluster of tfs3 ICE was a reliable marker for the severity of disease in the H. pylori infected population. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomarkers; Type Iv Secretion Systems; Biological Marker; Bacterial Gene; Duodenum Disease; Genetics; Helicobacter Infection; Helicobacter Pylori; Human; Metabolism; Microbiology; Pathophysiology; Severity Of Illness Index; Stomach Disease; Type Iv Secretion System; Viet Nam; Biomarkers; Duodenal Diseases; Genes, Bacterial; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Severity Of Illness Index; Stomach Diseases; Type Iv Secretion Systems; Vietnam","biological marker; bacterial gene; duodenum disease; genetics; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; human; metabolism; microbiology; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; stomach disease; type IV secretion system; Viet Nam; Biomarkers; Duodenal Diseases; Genes, Bacterial; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Severity of Illness Index; Stomach Diseases; Type IV Secretion Systems; Vietnam","","Biomarkers; Type IV Secretion Systems","This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan (26640114, 15H02657, and 16H05191) (Y.Y.), the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology from the MEXT of Japan (Y.Y.), and National Institutes of Health Grants DK62813 (Y.Y.).

Previous biochemical studies have shown that Ire1 exhibits strong endoribonuclease activity when its cytosolic kinase region captures ADP. Here, we asked how this event contributes to the regulation of Ire1 activity. At the beginning of this study, we obtained a luminal-domain mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1, deltaIdeltaIIIdeltaV/Y225H Ire1, which is deduced to be controlled by none of the luminal-side regulatory events. ER-stress responsiveness of deltaIdeltaIIIdeltaV/Y225H Ire1 was largely compromised by a further mutation on the kinase region, D797N/K799N, which allows Ire1 to be activated without capturing ADP. Therefore, in addition to the ER-luminal domain of Ire1, which monitors ER conditions, the kinase region is directly involved in the ER-stress responsiveness of Ire1. We propose that potent ER stress harms cells’ “vividness”, increasing the cytosolic ADP/ATP ratio, and eventually strongly activates Ire1. This mechanism seems to contribute to the suppression of inappropriately potent UPR under weak ER-stress conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adenosine Diphosphate; Proton Transporting Adenosine Triphosphatase; Ribonuclease; Adenosine Diphosphate; Atp Synthetase Complexes; Endoribonucleases; Ire1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Membrane Glycoproteins; Protein Serine-threonine Kinases; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Proteins; Adenosine Diphosphate; Ire1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Membrane Protein; Protein Binding; Proton Transporting Adenosine Triphosphatase; Ribonuclease; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Protein; Cytosol; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Metabolism; Phosphorylation; Physiology; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Signal Transduction; Unfolded Protein Response; Adenosine Diphosphate; Atp Synthetase Complexes; Cytosol; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Endoribonucleases; Membrane Glycoproteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein Serine-threonine Kinases; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Transduction; Unfolded Protein Response","adenosine diphosphate; IRE1 protein, S cerevisiae; membrane protein; protein binding; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; ribonuclease; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; cytosol; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; unfolded protein response; Adenosine Diphosphate; ATP Synthetase Complexes; Cytosol; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Endoribonucleases; Membrane Glycoproteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Transduction; Unfolded Protein Response","","adenosine diphosphate, 20398-34-9, 58-64-0; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; Adenosine Diphosphate; ATP Synthetase Complexes; Endoribonucleases; IRE1 protein, S cerevisiae; Membrane Glycoproteins; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins","We deeply thank to Prof. Hiroshi Takagi (Nara Inst.

We determined the prevalence and association of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the nasopharynx and conjunctiva among children in a community before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction. In October 2016, conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children (< 24 months old) and nasopharyngeal swabs from mothers in Nha Trang, Vietnam. Quantitative lytA PCR and DNA microarray were performed to detect and serotype S. pneumoniae. The association between S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx and conjunctiva was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression model. Among 698 children, 62 (8.9%, 95% CI 6.9–11.2%) were positive for S. pneumoniae in the conjunctiva. Non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae were most commonly identified, followed by serotypes 6A, 6B, and 14. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival detection were positively associated (aOR 47.30, 95% CI 24.07–92.97). Low birth-weight, day-care attendance, and recent eye symptoms were independently associated with S. pneumoniae detection in the conjunctiva (aOR 11.14, 95% CI 3.76–32.98, aOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.45–3.31, and aOR 3.59, 95% CI 2.21–5.84, respectively). Serotypes and genotypes in the conjunctiva and nasopharynx matched in 87% of the children. Three mothers’ nasopharyngeal pneumococcal samples had matched serotype and genotype with their child’s in the conjunctiva and nasopharynx. S. pneumoniae presence in nasopharynx and conjunctiva were strongly associated. The high concordance of serotypes suggests nasopharyngeal carriage may be a source of transmission to the conjunctiva. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child; Conjunctiva; Female; Human; Infant; Isolation And Purification; Male; Microbiology; Nasopharynx; Physiology; Preschool Child; Prevalence; Streptococcus Pneumoniae; Viet Nam; Child; Child, Preschool; Conjunctiva; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Nasopharynx; Prevalence; Vietnam","child; conjunctiva; female; human; infant; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; nasopharynx; physiology; preschool child; prevalence; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Viet Nam; Child; Child, Preschool; Conjunctiva; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Nasopharynx; Prevalence; Vietnam","","","The authors would like to thank all the study participants, the staff of the commune health centers and Khanh Hoa Health Service for their field work on the survey, the staff of the Pneumococcal Microbiology laboratory at MCRI, and Editage (http://www.editage.com) for editing this manuscript for English language.

We propose a constrained periodic framework with corner-to-corner and edge-to-edge sharing of tetrahedra and develop a kinematic model incorporating two types of linear springs to calculate the momentum term under infinitesimal transformations. The modal analysis shows that the microstructure with its two degrees of freedom has both low- and high-frequency modes under auxetic transformations. The low-frequency mode approaches zero frequency when the corresponding spring constant tends to zero. With regard to coupled eigenmodes, the stress-strain relationship of the uniaxial forced vibration covers a wide range. When excited, a very slow motion is clearly observed along with a structural expansion for almost zero values of the linear elastic modulus. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auxeticity; Mechanical Metamaterial; Periodic Framework; Tetrahedron; Vibration; Zero Stiffness","","","","The author (H.T.) gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (JSPS KAKENHI grant no. 18H01334).

Southeast Asian countries where several boundary lines exist were considered as the origin of seagrasses. We hypothesize that the boundary lines, such as Wallace’s and Lydekker’s Lines, may act as marine geographic barriers to the population structure of Halophila major. Seagrass samples were collected at three islands in Vietnamese waters and analyzed by the molecular maker ITS. These sequences were compared with published ITS sequences from seagrasses collected in the whole region of interest. In this study, we reveal the haplotype and nucleotide diversity, linking population genetics, phylogeography, phylogenetics and estimation of relative divergence times of H. major and other members of the Halophila genus. The morphological characters show variation. The results of the ITS marker analysis reveal smaller groups of H. major from Myanmar, Shoalwater Bay (Australia) and Okinawa (Japan) with high supporting values. The remaining groups including Sri Lanka, Viet Nam, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Two Peoples Bay (Australia) and Tokushima (Japan) showed low supporting values. The Wallacea region shows the highest haplotype and also nucleotide diversity. Non-significant differences were found among regions, but significant differences were presented among populations.

Health behavior theories suggest perceived vulnerability to a health threat and perceived effectiveness of recommended health-protective behaviors determine motivation to follow recommendations. Accordingly, we predicted that—as a result of politicization of the pandemic—politically conservative Americans would be less likely to enact recommended health-protective behaviors. In two longitudinal studies of U.S. residents, political conservatism was inversely associated with perceived health risk and adoption of health-protective behaviors over time. The effects of political orientation on health-protective behaviors were mediated by perceived risk of infection, perceived severity of infection, and perceived effectiveness of the health-protective behaviors. In a global cross-national analysis, effects were stronger in the U.S. (N = 10,923) than in an international sample (total N = 51,986), highlighting the increased and overt politicization of health behaviors in the U.S. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Sars-cov-2 Vaccine; Adult; Aged; American; Article; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Disease Severity; Female; Follow Up; Health Behavior; Health Hazard; Human; Infection Risk; Longitudinal Study; Male; Pandemic; Politicization; Politics; Prophylaxis; Social Distancing; United States; Vaccination; Adolescent; Cross-sectional Study; Epidemiology; Middle Aged; Motivation; Prevention And Control; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Covid-19; Cross-sectional Studies; Health Behavior; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Pandemics; Politics; Sars-cov-2","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; aged; American; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; female; follow up; health behavior; health hazard; human; infection risk; longitudinal study; male; pandemic; politicization; politics; prophylaxis; social distancing; United States; vaccination; adolescent; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; middle aged; motivation; prevention and control; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Behavior; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Pandemics; Politics; SARS-CoV-2","","","This research received support from the New York University Abu Dhabi (VCDSF/75-71015) to J.N., the University of Groningen (Sustainable Society & Ubbo Emmius Fund) to N.P.L., and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (COV20/00086) co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF ‘A way to make Europe’ to M.M.

Design This cross-sectional study investigated the gut microbiota of children with and without HIV. Methods We collected fecal samples from 59 children with HIV (29 treated with ART [ART(+)] and 30 without ART [HIV(+)]) and 20 children without HIV [HIV(–)] in Vietnam. We performed quantitative RT-PCR to detect 14 representative intestinal bacteria targeting 16S/23S rRNA molecules. We also collected the blood samples for immunological analyses. Results In spearman’s correlation analyses, no significant correlation between the number of dominant bacteria and age was found among children in the HIV(−) group. However, the number of sub-dominant bacteria, including Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae, positively correlated with age in the HIV(−) group, but not in the HIV(+) group. In the HIV(+) group, Clostridium coccoides group positively associated with the CD4+ cell count and its subsets. In the ART(+) group, Staphylococcus and C. perfringens positively correlated with CD4+ cells and their subsets and negatively with activated CD8+ cells. C. coccoides group and Bacteroides fragilis group were associated with regulatory T-cell counts. In multiple linear regression analyses, ART duration was independently associated with the number of C. perfringens, and Th17 cell count with the number of Staphylococcus in the ART(+) group.

This cross-sectional study investigated the relationships among this polymorphism, hypertension, and insulin resistance values (HOMA-IR) in 719 Japanese subjects aged 40 years and older. The genotype frequencies of Trp64Trp (homozygous, wild), Trp64Arg (heterozygous, variant), and Arg64Arg (homozygous, variant) were 466 (65%), 233 (32%), and 20 (3%), respectively. Insulin resistance was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in a Japanese population. This relationship was dependent on the presence or absence of the Trp64Arg polymorphism (odds ratio, 2.054; confidence interval, 1.191 to 3.541; P value, 0.010). Therefore, the Trp64Arg polymorphism of ADRB3 was associated with hypertension and insulin resistance in a healthy Japanese population.

The rate of antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacterales isolates to major antimicrobials, including carbapenems, is much higher in Vietnam than in Western countries, but the reasons remain unknown due to the lack of genomic epidemiology research. A previous study suggested that carbapenem resistance genes, such as the carbapenemase gene bla<inf>NDM</inf>, spread via plasmids among Enterobacterales in Vietnam. In this study, we characterized bla<inf>NDM</inf>-carrying plasmids in Enterobacterales isolated in Vietnam, and identified several possible cases of horizontal transfer of plasmids both within and among species of bacteria. Twenty-five carbapenem-nonsusceptible isolates from a medical institution in Hanoi were sequenced on Illumina short-read sequencers, and 13 bla<inf>NDM</inf>-positive isolates, including isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, and Proteus mirabilis, were further sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencer to obtain complete plasmid sequences. Almost identical 73 kb IncFII(pSE11)::IncN hybrid plasmids carrying bla<inf>NDM-1</inf> were found in a P. mirabilis isolate and an M. morganii isolate. A 112 kb IncFII(pRSB107)::IncN hybrid plasmid carrying bla<inf>NDM-1</inf> in an E. coli isolate had partially identical sequences with a 39 kb IncR plasmid carrying bla<inf>NDM-1</inf> and an 88 kb IncFII (pHN7A8)::IncN hybrid plasmid in a C. freundii isolate. 148–149 kb IncFIA(Hl1)::IncA/C2 plasmids and 75–76 kb IncFII(Yp) plasmids, both carrying bla<inf>NDM-1</inf> were shared among three sequence type 11 (ST11) isolates and three ST395 isolates of K. pneumoniae, respectively. Most of the plasmids co-carried genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, including third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, in addition to bla<inf>NDM-1</inf>. These results provide insight into the genetic basis of CRE in Vietnam, and could help control nosocomial infections. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Beta Lactamase; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Beta-lactamases; Carbapenemase; Antiinfective Agent; Bacterial Protein; Beta Lactamase; Carbapenemase; Drug Effect; Economics; Enterobacteriaceae; Enzymology; Genetics; Microbial Sensitivity Test; Plasmid; Viet Nam; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Beta-lactamases; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plasmids; Vietnam","antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; beta lactamase; carbapenemase; drug effect; economics; Enterobacteriaceae; enzymology; genetics; microbial sensitivity test; plasmid; Viet Nam; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamases; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plasmids; Vietnam","","beta lactamase, 9073-60-3; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamases; carbapenemase","","Martin, Amber L., Association between carbapenem resistance and mortality among adult, hospitalized patients with serious infections due to enterobacteriaceae: Results of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, Open Forum Infectious Diseases, 5, 7, (2018); Kohler, Philipp P., Carbapenem Resistance, Initial Antibiotic Therapy, and Mortality in Klebsiella pneumoniae Bacteremia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 38, 11, pp. 1319-1328, (2017); Tzouvelekis, Leonidas S., Carbapenemases in Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae: An evolving crisis of global dimensions, Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 25, 4, pp. 682-707, (2012); Tada, Tatsuya, Dissemination of Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates with various combinations of Carbapenemases (KPC-2, NDM-1, NDM-4, and OXA-48) and 16S rRNA Methylases (RmtB and RmtC) in Vietnam, BMC Infectious Diseases, 17, 1, (2017); Isozumi, Rie, BlaNDM-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae from environment, Vietnam, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 18, 8, pp. 1383-1385, (2012); Tran, Hoang Huy, Common isolation of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a large surgical hospital in Vietnam, European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, 34, 6, pp. 1247-1254, (2015); Wu, Wenjing, NDM metallo-β-lactamases and their bacterial producers in health care settings, Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 32, 2, (2019); Wailan, Alexander M., Mechanisms involved in acquisition of blaNDM genes by IncA/C2 and IncFIIY plasmids, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 60, 7, pp. 4082-4088, (2016); Patrice, Nordmann L., Carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Here is the storm!, Trends in Molecular Medicine, 18, 5, pp. 263-272, (2012); Poirel, Laurent, Tn125-related acquisition of blaNDM-like genes in Acinetobacter baumannii, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 56, 2, pp. 1087-1089, (2012)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","34319973","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111600707"

To assess the impact of current control measures on the number of new case indices 14 countries with the highest confirmed cases, highest mortality rate, and having a close relationship with the outbreak's origin; were selected and analyzed. Methods: In the study, we analyzed the impact of five control measures, including centralized isolation of all confirmed cases, closure of schools, closure of public areas, closure of cities, and closure of borders of the 14 targeted countries according to their timing; by comparing its absolute effect average, its absolute effect cumulative, and its relative effect average. Results: Our analysis determined that early centralized isolation of all confirmed cases was represented as a core intervention in significantly disrupting the pandemic's spread. This strategy helped in successfully controlling the early stage of the outbreak when the total number of cases were under 100, without the requirement of the closure of cities and public areas, which would impose a negative impact on the society and its economy. However, when the number of cases increased with the apparition of new clusters, coordination between centralized isolation and non-pharmaceutical interventions facilitated control of the crisis efficiently. Conclusion: Early centralized isolation of all confirmed cases should be implemented at the time of the first detected infectious case. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Disease Association; Disease Transmission; Economic Aspect; Human; Infection Control; Mortality Rate; Pandemic; Patient Care; Patient Isolation; Patient Volume; Prevention And Control; Social Aspect; Treatment Duration; Treatment Planning; Disease Notification; Quarantine; Statistical Model; Covid-19; Disease Notification; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Models, Statistical; Patient Isolation; Quarantine","Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease transmission; economic aspect; human; infection control; mortality rate; pandemic; patient care; patient isolation; patient volume; prevention and control; social aspect; treatment duration; treatment planning; disease notification; quarantine; statistical model; COVID-19; Disease Notification; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Models, Statistical; Patient Isolation; Quarantine","","","","Pneumonia of Unknown Cause China; undefined, (2020); Naming the Coronavirus Disease Covid 19 and the Virus that Causes It, (2020); WHO Director General S Opening Remarks at the Media Briefing on Covid 19, (2020); Novel Coronavirus 2019 Ncov, (2020); Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sars; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Mers Cov, (2025); Miles, David Kenneth, “Stay at Home, Protect the National Health Service, Save Lives”: A cost benefit analysis of the lockdown in the United Kingdom, International Journal of Clinical Practice, 75, 3, (2021); Impact of the Coronavirus Lockdown on Mental Health Evidence from the US, (2020); Kavaliunas, Andrius, Swedish policy analysis for Covid-19, Health Policy and Technology, 9, 4, pp. 598-612, (2020)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","34264966","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110674492"

Methods A quasi-experimental longitudinal study with a difference-in-differences design was conducted. A total of 280 new graduate nurses completed a self-administered questionnaire. The intervention group consisted of 206 respondents (those having participated in standard clinical training) and the control group (those that did not receive training) of 74. Differences in mean increases in competency scores between the intervention and control groups were estimated. The effect size of the intervention was estimated by calculating Cohen’s d. A generalized linear model was employed to identify the factors associated with mean increases. Results The mean increase in total competency scores (range: 0–6 points) in the intervention group was 0.73 points greater than in the control group with an intermediate effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.53; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.80). A greater reduction in standard deviation of total competency scores in the intervention group was confirmed. Participation in standard clinical training produced a positive association with a mean increase in total competency score without significance (β = 0.04, P = 0.321). Provincial hospitals as clinical training venues had a significantly positive association (β = 0.11, P = 0.007) with the mean increase in total competency scores. Competency at pre-clinical training was negatively (β = -0.75, P < 0.001) associated with the mean increase. Conclusion Findings implied that the standard clinical training program could contribute to both increasing and standardizing new graduate nurses’ competencies in Vietnam. Further studies are needed to more precisely examine the attribution of standard clinical training to better increase new graduate nurses’ competencies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Controlled Study; Effect Size; Female; Human; Human Experiment; Longitudinal Study; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nurse; Preclinical Study; Questionnaire; Training; Viet Nam; Clinical Competence; Nursing Education; Clinical Competence; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Nurses; Surveys And Questionnaires; Vietnam","adult; article; controlled study; effect size; female; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nurse; preclinical study; questionnaire; training; Viet Nam; clinical competence; nursing education; Clinical Competence; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Nurses; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","","Funding: This study was funded as a part of the Project for Strengthening Clinical Training System for New-Graduate Nurses, Vietnam (the Project), by Japan International Cooperation Agency, JICA (https://www.jica.go.jp/english/index.html).The funding source played no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, manuscript preparation.","World Health Statistics 2019 Monitoring Health for the Sdgs Sustainable Development Goals, (2019); Health Care at the Crossroads Strategies for Addressing the Evolving Nursing Crisis, (2002); Requirements for Continuous Professional Development, (2012); Efendi, Ferry, Nursing qualification and workforce for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community, Nursing Forum, 53, 2, pp. 197-203, (2018); Sonoda, Miwa, The evolution of the national licensing system of health care professionals: A qualitative descriptive case study in Lao People's Democratic Republic, Human Resources for Health, 15, 1, (2017); Current Issues in Nursing, (1985); Wakefield, Erin, Is your graduate nurse suffering from transition shock?, Journal of Perioperative Nursing, 31, 1, pp. 47-50, (2018); Duchscher, Judy E.Boychuk, Transition shock: The initial stage of role adaptation for newly graduated Registered Nurses, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 65, 5, pp. 1103-1113, (2009); Edwards, Deborah J., A systematic review of the effectiveness of strategies and interventions to improve the transition from student to newly qualified nurse, International Journal of Nursing Studies, 52, 7, pp. 1254-1268, (2015); Chappell, Kathy Brinkley, New graduate nurses, new graduate nurse transition programs, and clinical leadership skill, Journal for Nurses in Professional Development, 31, 3, pp. 128-137, (2015)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","34242294","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109741513"

We collected Mtb strains from patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in Da Nang, central Vietnam. Using a whole genome sequencing platform, including genome assembly complemented by long-read-sequencing data, genomic characteristics were studied. Of 181 Mtb isolates, predominant Vietnamese EAI4_VNM and EAI4-like spoligotypes (31.5%), ZERO strains (5.0%), and part of EAI5 (11.1%) were included in a lineage-1 (L1) sublineage, i.e., L1.1.1.1. These strains were found less often in younger people, and they genetically clustered less frequently than other modern strains. Patients infected with ZERO strains demonstrated less lung infiltration. A region in RD2bcg spanning six loci, i.e., PE_PGRS35, cfp21, Rv1985c, Rv1986, Rv1987, and erm(37), was deleted in EAI4_VNM, EAI4-like, and ZERO strains, whereas another 118 bp deletion in furA was specific only to ZERO strains. L1.1.1.1-sublineage-specific deletions in PE_PGRS4 and PE_PGRS22 were also identified. RD900, seen in ancestral lineages, was present in majority of the L1 members. All strains without IS6110 (5.0%) had the ZERO spoligo-pattern. Distinctive features of the ancestral L1 strains provide a basis for investigation of the modern versus ancestral Mtb lineages and allow consideration of countermeasures against this heterogeneous pathogen.

Water was sampled at 18 locations along the mainstream, tributaries and distributaries of the Mekong River. To check for accuracy and precision, measurements of the 87Sr/86Sr ratios and trace element concentrations were then compared in two laboratories that use different analytical methods. Differences in trace element concentrations between locations were not significant and could not, therefore, be used to discriminate between migration pathways. However, the Mekong mainstream, tributaries and distributaries could all be discriminated using Sr isotopes. The 87Sr/86Sr profiles recorded in P. krempfi otoliths showed that there were three contingents with obligate freshwater hatching and variable spawning sites along the Mekong mainstream, from Phnom Penh (Cambodia) to Nong Khai (Thailand) or further. After hatching, the fish migrated more or less rapidly to the Mekong Delta and then settled for most of their lifetime in brackish water. Spawning habitats and migration routes may be threatened by habitat shifts and the increasing number of hydropower dams along the river, especially the contingents born above Khone Falls (Laos). The conservation of P. krempfi, as well as other migratory fish in the Mekong River, requires agreements, common actions and management by all countries along the Mekong River. This study highlighted the importance of using both Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios to understand life history of anadromous fishes as the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the water was shown to be less effective than the Sr/Ca ratio in identifying movements between different saline areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Strontium; Water; Strontium Isotopes; Trace Elements; Water; Radioisotope; Strontium 86; Strontium 87; Trace Element; Unclassified Drug; Strontium; Water; Article; Cambodia; Catfish; Comparative Study; Concentration (parameter); Habitat Structure; Hatching; Hydropower; Life History; Measurement Accuracy; Nonhuman; Otolith; Pangasius Krempfi; Population Migration; River Ecosystem; Spawning; Thailand; Water Pollution; Animal; Chemistry; China; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Otolithic Membrane; Physiology; River; Animal Migration; Animals; Catfishes; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Otolithic Membrane; Rivers; Strontium Isotopes; Trace Elements; Water","radioisotope; strontium 86; strontium 87; trace element; unclassified drug; strontium; water; Article; Cambodia; catfish; comparative study; concentration (parameter); habitat structure; hatching; hydropower; life history; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; otolith; Pangasius krempfi; population migration; river ecosystem; spawning; Thailand; water pollution; animal; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; geography; otolithic membrane; physiology; river; Animal Migration; Animals; Catfishes; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Otolithic Membrane; Rivers; Strontium Isotopes; Trace Elements; Water","","strontium, 7440-24-6; water, 7732-18-5; Strontium Isotopes; Trace Elements; Water","","State of the Basin Report, (2003); Liu, Shaochuang, Pinpointing source of Mekong and measuring its length through analysis of satellite imagery and field investigations, Geo-Spatial Information Science, 10, 1, pp. 51-56, (2007); Fishes of the Greater Mekong Ecosystem with Species List and Photographic Atlas, (2012); Biodiversity and Fisheries in the Lower Mekong Basin, (2003); Fisheries Bioecology at the Khone Falls Mekong River Southern Laos, (2005); Stone, Richard, Dam-building threatens Mekong fisheries, Science, 354, 6316, pp. 1084-1085, (2016); Kano, Yuichi, Impacts of dams and global warming on fish biodiversity in the Indo-Burma hotspot, PLOS ONE, 11, 8, (2016); Ficke, Ashley Duncan, Potential impacts of global climate change on freshwater fisheries, Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries, 17, 4, pp. 581-613, (2007); Lauri, Hannu, Future changes in Mekong River hydrology: Impact of climate change and reservoir operation on discharge, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 16, 12, pp. 4603-4619, (2012); Nguyen, Anh Lam, Simulated Impacts of Climate Change on Current Farming Locations of Striped Catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus; Sauvage) in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, Ambio, 43, 8, pp. 1059-1068, (2014)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","34111178","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107800374"

To justify the application of fly ash in agriculture, the Pha Lai (Vietnam) thermal power plant-derived fly ash (FA) was amended, along with farmyard manure (FYM) and NPK chemical fertilizer (NPK), to sandy soil in Quang Binh (Vietnam) for peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivation. The effect of FA amendment was investigated, based on the changes in soil properties and peanut yields. The results revealed that the FA amendment had positive benefits to soil properties and peanut yields. Especially, the amendment of 5% FA in combination with FYM and NPK increased notably the proportion of silt-sized particles, surface charges, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, contents of Ca2+ and Mg2+, contents of total and available P and K, and hydraulic conductivity. Microbial populations, enzyme activities, and bacterial community diversity were considerably improved. More dominant species, viz. Paraburkholderia sacchari, Rheinheimera tangshanensis, and Betaproteobacteria bacterium, were observed. Moreover, the FA increased dry peanut grain yield from 0.19 to 2.3 t/ha (12.1-fold). It is recommended to utilize 5% FA along with FYM and NPK in peanut production for economically valuable and environmentally friendly disposal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fly Ash; Peanut; Sandy Soil Properties; Soil Amendment; Soil Microbial Activities","","","","Acknowledgements: This research is funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number: 105.08-2014.31.","Yunusa, Isa A.M., Application of coal fly ash in agriculture: A strategic perspective, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 42, 6, pp. 559-600, (2012); Oilseed Crops, (1983); Taylor, E.

Here, we found that mouse dermal fibroblasts that infiltrate to sponges subcutaneously implanted express VEGF-D and sushi, Von Willebrand factor type A, EGF, and pentraxin domain containing 1 (SVEP1) in response to PDGFRβ signal. In vitro, Pdgfrb knockout (β-KO) fibroblasts had reduced expression of VEGF-D and SVEP1 and overproduced Amphiregulin. Dysregulation of these three factors was involved in the cyst-like and uneven distribution of lymphatic vessels observed in the β-KO mice. Similarly, in human cystic lymphangioma, which is one of the intractable diseases and mostly occurs in childhood, fibroblasts surrounding cystic lymphatics highly expressed Amphiregulin. Moreover, fibroblastderived Amphiregulin could induce the expression of Amphiregulin in lymphatic endothelial cells. The dual source of Amphiregulin activated EGFR expressed on the lymphatic endothelial cells. This exacerbation cascade induced proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells to form cystic lymphangioma. Ultimately, excessive Amphiregulin produced by fibroblasts surrounding lymphatics and by lymphatic endothelial cells per se results in pathogenesis of cystic lymphangioma and will be a fascinating therapeutic target of cystic lymphangioma. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amphiregulin; Cystic Lymphangioma; Lymphangiogeneis; Pathogenesis; Pdgfrβ Cko; Amphiregulin; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Vasculotropin D; Von Willebrand Factor; Vasculotropin C; Amphiregulin; Areg Protein, Human; Areg Protein, Mouse; Receptor, Platelet-derived Growth Factor Beta; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D; Vegfd Protein, Mouse; Amphiregulin; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Unclassified Drug; Vasculotropin D; Von Willebrand Factor; Von Willebrand Factor Type A; Areg Protein, Human; Areg Protein, Mouse; Platelet Derived Growth Factor Beta Receptor; Vasculotropin C; Vegfd Protein, Mouse; Angiogenesis; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Controlled Study; Cystic Lymphangioma; Disease Exacerbation; Female; Lymph Vessel Endothelium; Male; Mouse; Nonhuman; Pathogenesis; Phenotype; Priority Journal; Protein Expression; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Signal Transduction; Animal; Cell Proliferation; Drug Effect; Endothelium Cell; Fibroblast; Genetics; Human; Knockout Mouse; Lymph Vessel; Lymphangiogenesis; Metabolism; Pathology; Physiology; Amphiregulin; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Endothelial Cells; Female; Fibroblasts; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphangioma, Cystic; Lymphatic Vessels; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Receptor, Platelet-derived Growth Factor Beta; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D","amphiregulin; epidermal growth factor receptor; unclassified drug; vasculotropin D; von Willebrand factor; von Willebrand factor type A; AREG protein, human; Areg protein, mouse; platelet derived growth factor beta receptor; vasculotropin C; Vegfd protein, mouse; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cystic lymphangioma; disease exacerbation; female; lymph vessel endothelium; male; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; animal; cell proliferation; drug effect; endothelium cell; fibroblast; genetics; human; knockout mouse; lymph vessel; lymphangiogenesis; metabolism; pathology; physiology; Amphiregulin; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Endothelial Cells; Female; Fibroblasts; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphangioma, Cystic; Lymphatic Vessels; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D","","amphiregulin, 117147-70-3; epidermal growth factor receptor, 79079-06-4; vasculotropin D, 193363-12-1; von Willebrand factor, 109319-16-6; vasculotropin C, 171342-42-0, 185969-81-7; Amphiregulin; AREG protein, human; Areg protein, mouse; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D; Vegfd protein, mouse","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

However, ALP may result in a misallocation of resources. Examining rice land policy in Vietnam, we determine the optimal level of rice land protected against other crops using a stochastic optimization model built on top of a general equilibrium framework, combined with sequential micro-simulations on household data. We find that converting part of protected rice land enhances economic efficiency. Nonetheless, the policy is relatively pro-rich, implying a trade-off between poverty reduction and economic efficiency, making some households in already poor areas worse off. Our approach can be applied to land-use planning generally, highlighting the relevant tradeoffs and the search for needed optimal land-use policies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Farmland Protection; Household Welfare; Inequality; Land Policy; Rice; Vietnam","","","","This work was supported by the Restructuring for a more Competitive Vietnam Project , the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade ( DFAT ) and College of Asia and the Pacific , the Australian National University .","Alterman, Rachelle, The challenge of farmland preservation: Lessons from a Six-Nation comparison, Journal of the American Planning Association, 63, 2, pp. 220-243, (1997); Azadi, Hosein, Agricultural land conversion drivers: A comparison between less developed, developing and developed countries, Land Degradation and Development, 22, 6, pp. 596-604, (2011); Barrett, Christopher B., Farmers' welfare and changing food prices: Nonparametric evidence from rice in Madagascar, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 78, 3, pp. 656-669, (1996); Bengston, David N., Public policies for managing urban growth and protecting open space: Policy instruments and lessons learned in the United States, Landscape and Urban Planning, 69, 2-3, pp. 271-286, (2004); Economic Growth Poverty and Household Welfare in Vietnam, (2004); Brandt, Loren, Land rights in rural China: Facts, fictions and issues, China Journal, 47, pp. 67-97, (2002); Budd, John W., Changing food prices and rural welfare: a nonparametric examination of the Cote d'Ivoire, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 41, 3, pp. 587-603, (1993); Che, Tuong Nhu, Incentives and static and dynamic gains from market reform: Rice production in Vietnam, Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 45, 4, pp. 547-572, (2001); A 2011 Social Accounting Matrix SAM for Vietnam, (2014); undefined, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","24058440","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112501825"

Although TDF-exposed infants often show transient growth impairment, it is not clear whether maternal TDF causes infantile rickets via maternal/fetal renal dysfunction in Asian populations. This prospective observational study was conducted in Vietnam and involved pregnant HIV-infected women treated with TDF-based regimen (TDF group) or zidovudine-based regimen (AZT-group). At birth, 3, 12, and 18 months of age, and included body length, weight, head circumference, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, urineβ2-microglobulin (U-BMG), percentage of tubular reabsorption of phosphate (%TRP), and radiographic wrist score for rickets. Age-adjusted multivariate linear regression analysis evaluated the association of TDF/AZT use during pregnancy with fetal renal function and bone health. The study included 63 mother-infant pairs (TDF group = 53, AZT group = 10). In the mothers, detectable U-BMG (>252 μg/L) was observed more frequently in the TDF-than AZT group (89 vs 50%, p<0.001), but other renal/bone parameters were similar. In infants, maternal TDF use was not associated with growth impairment, renal dysfunction, or abnormal bone findings, but with a slightly higher ALP levels (p = 0.019). However, shorter length was associated with maternal AZT (p = 0.021), and worse radiographic scores were associated with LPV/r (p = 0.024). In Vietnamese population, TDF usage during pregnancy was not associated with infant transient rickets, growth impairment, or renal dysfunction, despite mild maternal tubular impairment. Maternal AZT and LPV/r influenced infant growth and bone health, though further studies are needed to confirm this finding. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline Phosphatase; Beta 2 Microglobulin;

Here, we analyze time series of low, mean, and high river flows from 7250 observatories around the world covering the years 1971 to 2010. We identify spatially complex trend patterns, where some regions are drying and others are wetting consistently across low, mean, and high flows. Trends computed from state-of-the-art model simulations are consistent with the observations only if radiative forcing that accounts for anthropogenic climate change is considered. Simulated effects of water and land management do not suffice to reproduce the observed trend pattern. Thus, the analysis provides clear evidence for the role of externally forced climate change as a causal driver of recent trends in mean and extreme river flow at the global scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthropogenic Effect; Climate Change; Global Perspective; Land Management; Observational Method; Radiative Forcing; River Flow; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Article; Environmental Factor; Environmental Impact; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Land Use; River; Soil Moisture; Trend Study; Water Management","anthropogenic effect; climate change; global perspective; land management; observational method; radiative forcing; river flow; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; land use; river; soil moisture; trend study; water management","","","We acknowledge financial support as follows: L.G. and S.I.S. were supported through the H2020 projects CRESCENDO (grant no. 641816) and 4C (grant no. 821003).

Therefore, this cross-sectional study examined the effects of regular exercise and nutrient intake on sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which is the most frequently used index for sleep evaluation. Methods The participants included 378 individuals aged 40 years or older living in Shika Town, Ishikawa Prefecture. Of these individuals, 185 met the inclusion criteria. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing lifestyle habits and frequency and duration of exercise, the PSQI, and the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) on nutrient intake. Results A two-way analysis of covariance on regular exercise and PSQI scores indicated that protein intake (17.13% of energy) was significantly higher in the regular exercise and PSQI ≤10 groups than in the non-regular exercise or PSQI ≥11 groups (p = 0.002). In a multiple logistic regression analysis with PSQI scores (≤10 and ≥11), protein intake was a significant independent variable in any of the models adjusted for confounding factors such as age, sex, body mass index, current smoker, and current drinker (OR: 1.357, 95% CI: 1.081, 1.704, p = 0.009) in the regular exercise group but not in the non-regular exercise group. Conclusions We identified a positive relationship between sleep quality and protein intake in the regular exercise group. These findings suggest that regular exercise at least twice a week for 30 minutes or longer combined with high protein intake contributes to good sleep quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Age; Analysis Of Covariance; Article; Body Mass; Confounding Variable; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Current Drinker; Current Smoker; Exercise; Female; Habit; Human; Human Experiment; Independent Variable; Lifestyle; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nutrient Intake; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Protein Intake; Questionnaire; Sleep Quality; Aged; Caloric Intake; Eating; Health Survey; Middle Aged; Physiology; Protein Diet; Risk Factor; Sleep; Sleep Disorder; Very Elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Body Mass Index; Cross-sectional Studies; Diet, High-protein; Eating; Energy Intake; Exercise; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders","adult; age; analysis of covariance; article; body mass; confounding variable; controlled study; cross-sectional study; current drinker; current smoker; exercise; female; habit; human; human experiment; independent variable; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; nutrient intake; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; protein intake; questionnaire; sleep quality; aged; caloric intake; eating; health survey; middle aged; physiology; protein diet; risk factor; sleep; sleep disorder; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet, High-Protein; Eating; Energy Intake; Exercise; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders","","","The present study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology (MEXT), number 15H04783 and 16H03245.

Globally comparable, annual, local estimates of routine first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage are critical for understanding geographically precise immunity patterns, progress towards the targets of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), and high-risk areas amid disruptions to vaccination programmes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)5–8. Here we generated annual estimates of routine childhood MCV1 coverage at 5 × 5-km2 pixel and second administrative levels from 2000 to 2019 in 101 LMICs, quantified geographical inequality and assessed vaccination status by geographical remoteness. After widespread MCV1 gains from 2000 to 2010, coverage regressed in more than half of the districts between 2010 and 2019, leaving many LMICs far from the GVAP goal of 80% coverage in all districts by 2019. MCV1 coverage was lower in rural than in urban locations, although a larger proportion of unvaccinated children overall lived in urban locations; strategies to provide essential vaccination services should address both geographical contexts. These results provide a tool for decision-makers to strengthen routine MCV1 immunization programmes and provide equitable disease protection for all children. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Immune System; Immunity; Immunization; Measles; Vaccination; Vaccine; Virus; Article; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Human; Low Income Country; Measles Vaccination; Middle Income Country; Priority Journal; Rural Area; Urban Area; Vaccination Coverage; Child; Developing Country; Geographic Mapping; Health Care Disparity; Immunology; International Cooperation; Preschool Child; Rural Health; Uncertainty; Urban Health; Vaccination Refusal; Coronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Developed Countries; Geographic Mapping; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Internationality; Measles; Rural Health; Uncertainty; Urban Health; Vaccination; Vaccination Refusal","immune system; immunity; immunization; measles; vaccination; vaccine; virus; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; human; low income country; measles vaccination; middle income country; priority journal; rural area; urban area; vaccination coverage; child; developing country; geographic mapping; health care disparity; immunology; international cooperation; preschool child; rural health; uncertainty; urban health; vaccination refusal; Coronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Developed Countries; Geographic Mapping; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Internationality; Measles; Rural Health; Uncertainty; Urban Health; Vaccination; Vaccination Refusal","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements This work was primarily supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1182474, OPP11093011 and OPP1132415).

This study focused on an experimental examination of the mechanical properties of eco-fine-grained concrete using saline sand replacement of fine aggregate with a high percentage replacement of cement by GGBFS. Experimental tests were conducted to examine compressive, tensile, flexural strength, chloride penetration, and water absorption. The results indicate that the compressive and tensile strength decreased with the increasing amount of GGBFS replacement for cement (from 0 to 50%). On the other hand, the flexural strength of the mixture comprising 30% GGBFS was almost equal to that of the mixture without GGBFS. At 28 days, values of compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural strengths of this fine-grained concrete were greater than those of conventional concrete. The values of chloride penetration decreased from 219.0 to 1531.5 coulombs when the amount of GGBFS replacement for cement increased from 0% to 50%. This fine-grained concrete containing 30% to 50% GGBFS replacement for cement was classified into the low chloride penetration concrete. The increase in GGBFS content led to a reduction in chloride penetration and water absorption.

The eco-friendly mortar samples were produced using various ratios of fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS), and silica fume (SF) as cementitious materials. Seven mixtures of eco-friendly mortars, including a control mixture; three mixtures with respective substitutions of GGBFS for Portland cement of 10, 20, and 30% by cement mass; and three mixtures with respective additions of SF of 5, 10, and 15% by total binder mass, were used to produce the samples. Tests, including compressive strength, flexural strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), electrical surface resistivity (ESR), rapid chloride ion penetration (RCP), thermal conductivity (TC), and microstructure analysis, were conducted to determine the mechanical strength and durability values of the samples. The experimental results show that replacing Portland cement with GGBFS negatively affected the properties of the mortars by reducing the mechanical strength, UPV, ESR, and TC while increasing the RCP in the samples. Also, adding an appropriate amount of SF could improve the mechanical strength and durability characteristics of the eco-friendly mortars. As a result, the mortar sample containing 30% GGBFS and 10% SF earned compressive and flexural strength values of approximately 49.2 and 13.8 MPa, respectively, at 56 days of curing age. Mortar samples with UPV values >3660 m/s were identified as ""high quality"". The corrosion resistance of all of the samples was found to be high, particularly in chloride-contaminated environments, due to relatively low (1000 - 2000 Coulombs) RCP values. The best overall performance was recorded for the sample containing 30% GGBFS and 10% SF. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eco-friendly Mortar; Electrical Surface Resistivity; Rapid Chloride-ion Penetration; Thermal Conductivity; Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity; Bending Strength; Blast Furnaces; Chlorine Compounds; Compressive Strength; Concrete Mixtures; Corrosion Resistance; Durability; Fly Ash; Light Velocity; Mixtures; Portland Cement; Silica Fume; Slags; Thermal Conductivity; Chloride Ion Penetration; Eco-friendly; Eco-friendly Mortar; Electrical Surface Resistivity; Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag; Mechanical; Rapid Chloride-ion Penetration; Surface Resistivity; Three Mixtures; Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity; Mortar","Bending strength; Blast furnaces; Chlorine compounds; Compressive strength; Concrete mixtures; Corrosion resistance; Durability; Fly ash; Light velocity; Mixtures; Portland cement; Silica fume; Slags; Thermal conductivity; Chloride ion penetration; Eco-friendly; Eco-friendly mortar; Electrical surface resistivity; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Mechanical; Rapid chloride-ion penetration; Surface resistivity; Three mixtures; Ultrasonic pulse velocity; Mortar","","","","Hydraulic Structures, (2007); Wu, Zhongru, Review on hidden trouble detection and health diagnosis of hydraulic concrete structures, Science in China, Series E: Technological Sciences, 50, SUPPL. 1, pp. 34-50, (2007); Li, Yi, Microbial enhanced corrosion of hydraulic concrete structures under hydrodynamic conditions: Microbial community composition and functional prediction, Construction and Building Materials, 248, (2020); Song, Yarong, Distinct microbially induced concrete corrosion at the tidal region of reinforced concrete sewers, Water Research, 150, pp. 392-402, (2019); Maresca, Julia A., Analysis of bacterial communities in and on concrete, Materials and Structures/Materiaux et Constructions, 50, 1, (2017); Mehta, Povindar Kumar, Building durable structures in the 21st century, Indian Concrete Journal, 75, 7, pp. 437-443, (2001); Olivito, Renato Sante, Development of durable cementitious composites using sisal and flax fabrics for reinforcement of masonry structures, Materials and Design, 57, pp. 258-268, (2014); Mirza, Jahangir, Preferred test methods to select suitable surface repair materials in severe climates, Construction and Building Materials, 50, pp. 692-698, (2014); Edwin, Romy Suryaningrat, Effect of secondary copper slag as cementitious material in ultra-high performance mortar, Construction and Building Materials, 119, pp. 31-44, (2016); Wang, Jixiang, Effects of fly ash on the properties and microstructure of alkali-activated FA/BFS repairing mortar, Fuel, 256, (2019)","","Tamkang University","","","","","","27089975; 27089967","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107286682"

The vast majority of cross-cultural studies on happiness have employed a Western-origin, or ""WEIRD"" measure of happiness that conceptualizes it as a self-centered (or ""independent""), high-arousal emotion. However, research from Eastern cultures, particularly Japan, conceptualizes happiness as including an interpersonal aspect emphasizing harmony and connectedness to others. Following a combined emicetic approach (Cheung, van de Vijver & Leong, 2011), we assessed the cross-cultural applicability of a measure of independent happiness developed in the US (Subjective Happiness Scale; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) and a measure of interdependent happiness developed in Japan (Interdependent Happiness Scale; Hitokoto & Uchida, 2015), with data from 63 countries representing 7 sociocultural regions. Results indicate that the schema of independent happiness was more coherent in more WEIRD countries. In contrast, the coherence of interdependent happiness was unrelated to a country's ""WEIRD-ness."" Reliabilities of both happiness measures were lowest in African and Middle Eastern countries, suggesting these two conceptualizations of happiness may not be globally comprehensive. Overall, while the two measures had many similar correlates and properties, the self-focused concept of independent happiness is ""WEIRD-er"" than interdependent happiness, suggesting cross-cultural researchers should attend to both conceptualizations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Happiness; Human; Human Experiment; Japan; Reliability; Female; International Cooperation; Male; Reproducibility; Theoretical Model; Young Adult; Female; Happiness; Humans; Internationality; Male; Models, Theoretical; Reproducibility Of Results; Young Adult","article; happiness; human; human experiment; Japan; reliability; female; international cooperation; male; reproducibility; theoretical model; young adult; Female; Happiness; Humans; Internationality; Male; Models, Theoretical; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult","","","The research was supported by the US National Science Foundation under Grant BCS- 1528131 for the primary authors.

Increased cortisol levels change both the brain morphology and function in MDD patients. The multivariate source-based morphometry (SBM) technique has been applied to investigate neuroanatomical changes in some neuropsychiatric diseases, but not MDD. We aimed to examine the alterations in gray matter (GM) networks and their relationship with serum cortisol levels in first-episode, drug-naïve MDD patients using SBM. Forty-two patients with MDD and 39 controls were recruited via interviews. Morning serum cortisol levels were measured, and high-resolution T1-weighted imaging followed by SBM analysis was performed in all participants. The patients had significantly higher serum cortisol levels than the controls. We found two GM sources, which were significantly different between patients with MDD and controls (prefrontal network, p <.01; insula-temporal network, p <.01). Serum cortisol levels showed a statistically significant negative correlation with the loading coefficients of the prefrontal network (r = − 0.354, p = 0.02). In conclusion, increased serum cortisol levels were associated with reductions in the prefrontal network in the early stage of MDD, and SBM may be a useful approach for analyzing structural MRI data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hydrocortisone; Hydrocortisone; Hydrocortisone; Adult; Blood; Brain; Brain Cortex; Brain Mapping; Diagnostic Imaging; Female; Gray Matter; Human; Hypophysis Adrenal System; Hypothalamus Hypophysis System; Major Depression; Male; Middle Aged; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pathophysiology; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-hypophyseal System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pituitary-adrenal System","hydrocortisone; adult; blood; brain; brain cortex; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; female; gray matter; human; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; major depression; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pituitary-Adrenal System","","hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; Hydrocortisone","This study was supported by a Health and Labor Research Grant in Japan (#1401010101).","Brody, Debra J., Prevalence of Depression Among Adults Aged 20 and Over: United States, 2013-2016, National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, 303, pp. 1-8, (2018); Singhal, Arvind, Risk of self-harm and suicide in people with specific psychiatric and physical disorders: Comparisons between disorders using English national record linkage, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, 107, 5, pp. 194-204, (2014); Fountoulakis, K.

This study aims to enhance the specific surface area (SSA) and pore volumes of biochars derived from the D. linearis by H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> activation and examine electrical properties of the activated biochars and their possible usage for the electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) electrode. The treated raw fern was activated with H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> 85% by the three different mixing ratios 1:0, 1:1, and 1:3 (w/w) and then pyrolysis under N<inf>2</inf> flow maintained at 500 °C for 1 h. The performance as the electrode for an EDLC was evaluated in 1 mol L−1 H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> solution for the H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf>-activated samples. The SSA and pore volumes were drastically increased after activation. The maximum SSA and pore volume were 1212 m2 g−1 and 1.43 cm3 g−1, respectively for the biochar activated at 400 °C with a weight mixing ratio 1:3 (w/w) between the fern and H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> acid while these values of the biochar at 400 °C were 12 m2 g−1 and 0.02 cm3 g−1, respectively. The biochar activated at 600 °C with the mixing ratio 1:1 (w/w) showed the maximum capacitance value, ca. 108 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1. The activation using H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> showed a positive tendency to enhance electrochemical properties and it could be a premise toward a higher performance of EDLC from the D. linearis derived activated biochar. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was supported by the Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under the project code DA163_15062019/ year 2019.

However, elements of its biodiversity remain unclear and highly threatened. In this context, the assessment of rare species is a starting point to develop effective strategies for the conservation of entire ecosystems. In this paper, we report upon cryptic amphibolid gastropods in Vietnamese mangrove forests from the Mekong Delta. The snail fauna in the mangrove forests was previously known from published literature and three museum specimens as three amphibolid species, ‘Amphibola’ burmana, A. quadrasi, Salinator fragilis and ‘S.’ quadrasi. We investigated the identities of such snails using molecular and morphological methods. The amphibolids found in this survey were identified to belong to the genus Naranjia, new for Vietnam fauna. In addition, our phylogenetic analyses suggested that the Vietnamese amphibolids were the same species as Naranjia sp. reported from Thailand, and the amphibolids have both genetic and morphological polymorphisms within the population. These findings add to the great biodiversity of Vietnamese mangrove forests and mudflats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Biodiversity; Fauna; Forest; Genetic Association; Genetic Polymorphism; Information Center; Mangrove; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Snail; Thailand; Viet Nam; Animal; Bayes Theorem; Environmental Protection; Genetics; Geography; Physiology; Species Difference; Wetland; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Geography; Phylogeny; Snails; Species Specificity; Vietnam; Wetlands","article; biodiversity; fauna; forest; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; information center; mangrove; nonhuman; phylogeny; snail; Thailand; Viet Nam; animal; Bayes theorem; environmental protection; genetics; geography; physiology; species difference; wetland; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Geography; Phylogeny; Snails; Species Specificity; Vietnam; Wetlands","","","This study was funded by the Far East Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences Grant Number 17-007 and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology Grant Number VAST.HTQT.NGA.01/17-18 and Grant-in-Aid for Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellow Grant Number 16J04692, 19J00392, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 18H02506 and 20K15866.","A Study on Aid to the Environment Sector in Vietnam, (1999); Myers, Norman, Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities, Nature, 403, 6772, pp. 853-858, (2000); Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, (2005); Iclarm Conference Proceedings, (1997); Ng, Peter K.L., The state of marine biodiversity in the South China Sea, Raffles Bulletin of Zoology, 48, 8 SUPPL., pp. 3-7, (2000); Reefs at Risk in Southeast Asia, (2002); An International Perspective on Wetland Rehabilitation, (1999); Potential for Mangrove Carbon Projects in Vietnam, (2011); Veettil, Bijeesh Kozhikkodan, Mangroves of Vietnam: Historical development, current state of research and future threats, Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 218, pp. 212-236, (2019); Mangroves of the Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve Viet Nam, (2012)","","Nature Research subscriptions@nature.com","","","","","","20452322","","","33127930","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094679762"

Low pathogenic (Low-path LP) AI in chickens caused by less virulent strains of AI viruses (AIVs)—when compared with highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs)—are not even well-described yet or known how they contribute to wider AI and immune system issues. Co-circulation of LPAIVs with HPAIVs suggests their interactions in their ecological aspects. Here we show for the Pacific Rim an international approach how to data mine and model-predict LP AI and its ecological niche with machine learning and open access data sets and geographic information systems (GIS) on a 5 km pixel size for best-possible inference. This is based on the best-available data on the issue (~ 40,827 records of lab-analyzed field data from Japan, Russia, Vietnam, Mongolia, Alaska and Influenza Research Database (IRD) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) database sets, as well as 19 GIS data layers). We sampled 157 hosts and 110 low-path AIVs with 32 species as drivers. The prevalence across low-path AIV subtypes is dominated by Muscovy ducks, Mallards, Whistling Swans and gulls also emphasizing industrial impacts for the human-dominated wildlife contact zone. This investigation sets a good precedent for the study of reservoirs, big data mining, predictions and subsequent outbreaks of HPAI and other pandemics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal; Avian Influenza; Bird; Chicken; Data Mining; Disease Carrier; Duck; Forecasting; Information Processing; Orthomyxoviridae; Pacific Ocean; Pathogenicity; Prevalence; Procedures; Statistical Model; Virology; Animals; Birds; Chickens; Data Mining; Datasets As Topic; Disease Reservoirs; Ducks; Forecasting; Influenza In Birds; Models, Statistical; Prevalence","animal; avian influenza; bird; chicken; data mining; disease carrier; duck; forecasting; information processing; Orthomyxoviridae; Pacific Ocean; pathogenicity; prevalence; procedures; statistical model; virology; Animals; Birds; Chickens; Data Mining; Datasets as Topic; Disease Reservoirs; Ducks; Forecasting; Influenza in Birds; Models, Statistical; Prevalence","","","Funding text 1: Data reported in the Influenza Research Database (IRD) were from samples obtained and submitted under NIH-funded avian influenza surveillance collection efforts (CEIRS) and are publicly available at: www.fludb .org .

The increasing availability of next-generation sequencing, bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) can facilitate a more reliable and faster alternative to traditional phenotyping for the detection and surveillance of AMR. This work proposes a machine learning approach that can predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for a given antibiotic, here ciprofloxacin, on the basis of both genome-wide mutation profiles and profiles of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. We analysed 704 Escherichia coli genomes combined with their respective MIC measurements for ciprofloxacin originating from different countries. The four most important predictors found by the model, mutations in gyrA residues Ser83 and Asp87, a mutation in parC residue Ser80 and presence of the qnrS1 gene, have been experimentally validated before. Using only these four predictors in a linear regression model, 65% and 93% of the test samples’ MIC were correctly predicted within a two- and a four-fold dilution range, respectively. The presented work does not treat machine learning as a black box model concept, but also identifies the genomic features that determine susceptibility. The recent progress in WGS technology in combination with machine learning analysis approaches indicates that in the near future WGS of bacteria might become cheaper and faster than a MIC measurement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ciprofloxacin; Dna Topoisomerase (atp Hydrolysing); Anti-bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Dna Gyrase; Escherichia Coli Proteins; Intracellular Signaling Peptides And Proteins; Qnrs1 Protein, E Coli; Antiinfective Agent; Ciprofloxacin; Dna Topoisomerase (atp Hydrolysing); Escherichia Coli Protein; Qnrs1 Protein, E Coli; Signal Peptide; Antibiotic Resistance; Bacterial Gene; Drug Effect; Escherichia Coli; Genetics; Ic50; Machine Learning; Mutation; Procedures; Toxicity Testing; Anti-bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Dna Gyrase; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia Coli Proteins; Genes, Bacterial; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Intracellular Signaling Peptides And Proteins; Machine Learning; Mutation; Toxicity Tests","antiinfective agent; ciprofloxacin; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); Escherichia coli protein; qnrS1 protein, E coli; signal peptide; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; drug effect; Escherichia coli; genetics; IC50; machine learning; mutation; procedures; toxicity testing; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; DNA Gyrase; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli Proteins; Genes, Bacterial; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Machine Learning; Mutation; Toxicity Tests","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; DNA Gyrase; Escherichia coli Proteins; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; qnrS1 protein, E coli","This study was supported by the COMPARE Consortium, which has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant agreement No. 643476.

While radiological risks have been estimated from the activity concentrations of natural radionuclides in soil, it is important to evaluate the changes of these risks for the built-up environment using these building materials. Based on the direct measurements of absorbed dose rate in air and calculation of absorbed dose rate in air from activity concentrations in soil for all of Vietnam which has undergone significant economic growth in recent decades, the changes of absorbed dose rate in air and radiological risks before and after construction of many artificial structures were investigated. The results showed that the absorbed dose rates in air were clearly changed by the urbanization, and the difference ratio for all of Vietnam ranged from 0.5 to 2.1, meaning that the artificial structures have been acting as shielding materials to terrestrial gamma-rays or radiation sources. However, changes in annual effective dose in the built-up environment were small, and there was no new radiation risk from the built-up environment for Vietnam. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Sources Effects and Risks of Ionizing Radiation, (2018); RAVISANKAR, R., Spatial distribution of gamma radioactivity levels and radiological hazard indices in the East Coastal sediments of Tamilnadu, India with statistical approach, Radiation Physics and Chemistry, 103, pp. 89-98, (2014); Ghiassi-Nejad, Mehdi, Very high background radiation areas of Ramsar, Iran: Preliminary biological studies, Health Physics, 82, 1, pp. 87-93, (2002); Moura, C.

This study aimed to investigate three-dimensional ultrastructural changes in axonal varicosities in the myenteric plexus and the effect thereon of the SGLT inhibitor phlorizin in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Three-dimensional ultrastructural analysis using serial block-face imaging revealed that non-treated HFD-fed mice had fewer axonal varicosities and synaptic vesicles in the myenteric plexus than did normal diet-fed control mice. Furthermore, mitochondrial volume was increased and lysosome number decreased in the axons of non-treated HFD-fed mice when compared to those of control mice. Phlorizin treatment restored the axonal varicosities and organelles in HFD-fed mice. Although HFD did not affect the immunolocalisation of PGP9.5, it reduced synaptophysin immunostaining in the myenteric plexus, which was restored by phlorizin treatment. These results suggest that impairment of the axonal varicosities and their synaptic vesicles underlies the damage to the enteric neurons caused by HFD feeding. SGLT inhibitor treatment could restore axonal varicosities and organelles, which may lead to improved gastrointestinal functions in HFD-induced obesity as well as diabetes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Phlorizin; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Dietary Fats; Phlorhizin; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Uchl1 Protein, Mouse; Phlorizin; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Uchl1 Protein, Mouse; Adverse Event; Animal; Axon; Fat Intake; Metabolism; Mouse; Myenteric Plexus; Obesity; Pathology; Pharmacology; Synapse Vesicle; Animals; Axons; Dietary Fats; Mice; Myenteric Plexus; Obesity; Phlorhizin; Synaptic Vesicles; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","phlorizin; ubiquitin thiolesterase; Uchl1 protein, mouse; adverse event; animal; axon; fat intake; metabolism; mouse; myenteric plexus; obesity; pathology; pharmacology; synapse vesicle; Animals; Axons; Dietary Fats; Mice; Myenteric Plexus; Obesity; Phlorhizin; Synaptic Vesicles; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","","phlorizin, 60-81-1, 7061-54-3; ubiquitin thiolesterase, 86480-67-3; Dietary Fats; Phlorhizin; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Uchl1 protein, mouse","We would like to thank Yuta Sakamoto, Toru Tamaki, Nana Yokota, Seiya Watanabe, Masashi Tanaka and Hiroshi Sakamoto at the Health Science University for technical assistance.

However, evaluation of the spin Hall angle and spin–orbit torque (SOT) of TIs is usually performed on high-quality single-crystalline TI thin films grown on dedicated III-V semiconductor substrates. Here, we report on room-temperature ultralow power SOT magnetization switching of a ferrimagnetic layer by non-epitaxial BiSb TI thin films deposited on Si/SiO<inf>2</inf> substrates. We show that non-epitaxial BiSb thin films outperform heavy metals and other epitaxial TI thin films in terms of the effective spin Hall angle and switching current density by one to nearly two orders of magnitude. The critical SOT switching current density in BiSb is as low as 7 × 104 A/cm2 at room temperature. The robustness of BiSb against crystal defects demonstrate its potential applications to SOT-based spintronic devices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work is supported by JST-CREST (JPMJCR18T5), and partly supported by TDK corporation.

For this purpose, the M5Rules algorithm was combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) in a novel hybrid technique, named M5Rules–GA model, for slope stability estimation and analysis and 450-slope observations in an open-pit mine in Vietnam were modeled using the Geo-Studio software based on essential parameters. The factor of safety was used as the model outcome. Artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and previously introduced models (such as FFA-SVR, ANN-PSO, ANN-ICA, ANN-GA, and ANN-ABC) were also developed for evaluating the proposed M5Rules–GA model. The evaluation of the model performance involved applying and computing the determination coefficient, variance account for, and root mean square error, as well as a general ranking and color scale. The results confirmed that the proposed M5Rules–GA model is a robust tool for analyzing slope stability.

The immobilization is expected to take place through the coordination between Ni(II) and His-tag. The bFGF-immobilized surface was exposed to citrate buffer solution to refold in situ the surface-immobilized bFGF. The secondary structure of immobilized bFGF-His was analyzed by solid-phase circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Immortalized human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were cultured on the bFGF-His-immobilized surface to examine their proliferation. CD spectroscopy revealed that the immobilized bFGF initially exhibited secondary structure rich in α-helix and that the spectrum was gradually transformed to exhibit the formation of β-strands upon exposure to citrate buffer solution, approaching to the spectrum of native bFGF. The rate of hMSC proliferation was 1.2-fold higher on the bFGF-immobilized surface treated with in situ citrate buffer, compared to the polystyrene surface. The immobilized bFGF-His treated in situ with citrate buffer solution seemed to be biologically active because its secondary structure approached its native state. This was well demonstrated by the cell culture experiments. From these results we conclude that immobilization of bFGF on the culture substrate serves to enhance proliferation of hMSCs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Citric Acid; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Histidine; Nickel; Buffers; Citrates; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Histidine; Immobilized Proteins; Nickel; Polystyrenes; Recombinant Proteins; Buffer; Citric Acid; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Glass; Histidine; Immobilized Protein; Nickel; Polystyrene Derivative; Recombinant Protein; Biomedical Engineering; Cell Adhesion; Cell Culture; Cell Culture Technique; Cell Differentiation; Cell Division; Cell Lineage; Circular Dichroism; Cytology; Devices; Flow Cytometry; Human; Mesenchymal Stem Cell; Ph; Procedures; Protein Secondary Structure; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Biomedical Engineering; Buffers; Cell Adhesion; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Cell Division; Cell Lineage; Cells, Cultured; Circular Dichroism; Citrates; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Flow Cytometry; Glass; Histidine; Humans; Hydrogen-ion Concentration; Immobilized Proteins; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Nickel; Polystyrenes; Protein Structure, Secondary; Recombinant Proteins; Surface Plasmon Resonance","buffer; citric acid; fibroblast growth factor 2; glass; histidine; immobilized protein; nickel; polystyrene derivative; recombinant protein; biomedical engineering; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell culture technique; cell differentiation; cell division; cell lineage; circular dichroism; cytology; devices; flow cytometry; human; mesenchymal stem cell; pH; procedures; protein secondary structure; surface plasmon resonance; Biomedical Engineering; Buffers; Cell Adhesion; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Cell Division; Cell Lineage; Cells, Cultured; Circular Dichroism; Citrates; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Flow Cytometry; Glass; Histidine; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Immobilized Proteins; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Nickel; Polystyrenes; Protein Structure, Secondary; Recombinant Proteins; Surface Plasmon Resonance","","citric acid, 126-44-3, 5949-29-1, 77-92-9, 8002-14-0; fibroblast growth factor 2, 106096-93-9; histidine, 645-35-2, 7006-35-1, 71-00-1; nickel, 7440-02-0; Buffers; Citrates; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Histidine; Immobilized Proteins; Nickel; Polystyrenes; Recombinant Proteins","The part of this work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number JP25293403 and JP16H03182.","Wagers, Amy J., Plasticity of adult stem cells, Cell, 116, 5, pp. 639-648, (2004); Aranda, Pablo, Epigenetic signatures associated with different levels of differentiation potential in human stem cells, PLOS ONE, 4, 11, (2009); Prockop, Darwin J., Marrow stromal cells as stem cells for nonhematopoietic tissues, Science, 276, 5309, pp. 71-74, (1997); Pittenger, Mark F., Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells, Science, 284, 5411, pp. 143-147, (1999); Dominici, Massimo, Minimal criteria for defining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells.

However, our new geological reconstruction of 2500-years of delta shoreline changes show that serious coastal erosion actually started much earlier. Data shows the sandy coast bounding river mouths accreted consistently at a rate of +2 to +4 km2/year. In contrast, we identified a variable accretion rate of the muddy deltaic protrusion at Camau; it was < +1 km2/year before 1400 years ago but increased drastically around 600 years ago, forming the entire Camau Peninsula. This high level of mud supply had sharply declined by the early 20th century after a vast canal network was built on the delta. Since then the Peninsula has been eroding, promoted by the conjunction of mud sequestration in the delta plain driven by expansion of rice cultivation, and hysteresis of long-term muddy sedimentation that left the protrusion exposed to wave erosion. Natural mitigation would require substantial increases in sediment supply well above the pre-1990s levels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Hysteresis; Nonhuman; Rice; Sediment; Sedimentation; Viet Nam","article; hysteresis; nonhuman; rice; sediment; sedimentation; Viet Nam","","","This project was funded by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (No. 17H02980) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science to Y.S. and the NAFOSTED Vietnam project 105.03-2018.12 to T.K.O.T., as well as by an internal grant of Geological Survey of Japan, AIST.

This study aimed to elucidate the epidemiological and genetic characteristics and virulence of EV-A71 strains isolated from children diagnosed with HFMD. Rectal and throat swabs were collected from 488 children with HFMD in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2015–2016. From 391 EV-positive patients, 15 EVs, including coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6; 47.1%) and EV-A71 (32.5%, n = 127), were identified. Of the 127 EV-A71 strains, 117 (92.1%) were the B5 subgenotype and 10 (7.9%) were the C4 subgenotype. A whole-genome analysis of EV-A71 strains showed that seven of the eight C4a strains isolated in 2016 formed a new lineage, including two possible recombinants between EV-A71 C4 and CV-A8. The proportion of inpatients among C4-infected children was higher than among B5-infected children (80.0% vs. 27.4%; P = 0.002). The virulence of EV-A71 strains was examined in human scavenger receptor class B2 (hSCARB2)-transgenic mice, and EV-A71 C4 strains exhibited higher mortality than B5 strains (80.0% vs. 30.0%, P = 0.0001). Thus, a new EV-A71 C4a-lineage, including two possible recombinants between EV-A71 C4 and CV-A8, appeared in 2016 in Vietnam. The EV-A71 C4 subgenotype may be more virulent than the B5 subgenotype. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lysosome-associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Receptors, Scavenger; Scarb2 Protein, Human; Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein; Scarb2 Protein, Human; Scavenger Receptor; Animal; Child; Classification; Enterovirus; Epidemic; Female; Genetics; Hand Foot And Mouth Disease; Human; Infant; Isolation And Purification; Male; Mortality; Mouse; Phylogeny; Physiology; Preschool Child; Serotype; Survival Rate; Time Factor; Transgenic Mouse; Viet Nam; Virology; Virus Replication; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Hand, Foot And Mouth Disease; Humans; Infant; Lysosome-associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Phylogeny; Receptors, Scavenger; Serogroup; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Vietnam; Virus Replication","lysosome associated membrane protein; SCARB2 protein, human; scavenger receptor; animal; child; classification; Enterovirus; epidemic; female; genetics; hand foot and mouth disease; human; infant; isolation and purification; male; mortality; mouse; phylogeny; physiology; preschool child; serotype; survival rate; time factor; transgenic mouse; Viet Nam; virology; virus replication; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Infant; Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Phylogeny; Receptors, Scavenger; Serogroup; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Vietnam; Virus Replication","","Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Receptors, Scavenger; SCARB2 protein, human","The authors thank all of the patients that participated in this study.

However, antibiotics are prescribed frequently for children with ARI, often in absence of evidence for bacterial infection. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for mild ARI in paediatric outpatients in relation to available guidelines and detected pathogens, 2) to assess antibiotic use on presentation using questionnaires and detection in urine 3) to assess the carriage rates and proportions of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae before, during and after consultation. Materials and methods Patients were prospectively enrolled in Children’s Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and diagnoses, prescribed therapy and outcome were recorded on first visit and on follow-up after 7 days. Respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens were detected using molecular assays. Antibiotic use before presentation was assessed using questionnaires and urine HPLC. The impact of antibiotic usage on intestinal Enterobacteriaceae was assessed with semi-quantitative culture on agar with and without antibiotics on presentation and after 7 and 28 days. Results A total of 563 patients were enrolled between February 2009 and February 2010. Antibiotics were prescribed for all except 2 of 563 patients. The majority were 2nd and 3rd generation oral cephalosporins and amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid. Respiratory viruses were detected in respiratory specimens of 72.5% of patients. Antibiotic use was considered inappropriate in 90.1% and 67.5%, based on guidelines and detected pathogens, respectively. On presentation parents reported antibiotic use for 22% of patients, 41% of parents did not know and 37% denied antibiotic use. Among these three groups, six commonly used antibiotics were detected with HPLC in patients’ urine in 49%, 40% and 14%, respectively. Temporary selection of 3rd generation cephalosporin resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae during antibiotic use was observed, with co-selection of resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Conclusions We report overuse and overprescription of antibiotics for uncomplicated ARI with selection of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae, posing a risk for community transmission and persistence in a setting of a highly granular healthcare system and unrestricted access to antibiotics through private pharmacies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amoxicillin; Amoxicillin Plus Clavulanic Acid; Cefaclor; Cefixime; Cefpodoxime; Cefuroxime Axetil; Erythromycin; Amoxicillin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Cephalosporins; Amoxicillin; Amoxicillin Plus Clavulanic Acid; Antibiotic Agent; Cefaclor; Cefixime; Cefpodoxime; Cefuroxime Axetil; Erythromycin; Antiinfective Agent; Cephalosporin Derivative; Article; Bacterium Culture; Bacterium Detection; Child; Clinical Effectiveness; Clinical Trial; Consultation; Disease Severity; Drug Effect; Drug Efficacy; Drug Response; Drug Use; Enterobacteriaceae; Female; Follow Up; High Performance Liquid Chromatography; Human; Intestine Flora; Major Clinical Study; Male; Observational Study; Outpatient; Pediatric Hospital; Preschool Child; Prescription; Prospective Study; Respiratory Tract Infection; Treatment Outcome; Urinalysis; Urine; Viet Nam; Antibiotic Resistance; Growth, Development And Aging; Infant; Isolation And Purification; Pathology; Severity Of Illness Index; Amoxicillin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Cephalosporins; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Prescriptions; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Follow-up Studies; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Infant; Male; Outpatients; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Tract Infections; Severity Of Illness Index; Vietnam","amoxicillin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antibiotic agent; cefaclor; cefixime; cefpodoxime; cefuroxime axetil; erythromycin; antiinfective agent; cephalosporin derivative; Article; bacterium culture; bacterium detection; child; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial; consultation; disease severity; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug response; drug use; Enterobacteriaceae; female; follow up; high performance liquid chromatography; human; intestine flora; major clinical study; male; observational study; outpatient; pediatric hospital; preschool child; prescription; prospective study; respiratory tract infection; treatment outcome; urinalysis; urine; Viet Nam; antibiotic resistance; growth, development and aging; infant; isolation and purification; pathology; severity of illness index; Amoxicillin; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cephalosporins; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Prescriptions; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Infant; Male; Outpatients; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Tract Infections; Severity of Illness Index; Vietnam","","amoxicillin, 26787-78-0, 34642-77-8, 61336-70-7; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 74469-00-4, 79198-29-1; cefaclor, 53994-73-3; cefixime, 79350-37-1; cefpodoxime, 82619-04-3; cefuroxime axetil, 64544-07-6; erythromycin, 114-07-8, 70536-18-4; Amoxicillin; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cephalosporins","This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust of Great Britain [077078/Z/05/Z and 089276/Z/09/Z].

The solar cell is classified into three main types: i) solar cells based on bulk silicon materials (monocrystalline, polycrystalline), ii) thin-film solar cells (CIGS, CdTe, DSSC, etc.), and iii) solar cells based on nanostructures and nanomaterials. Nowadays, commercial solar cells are usually made by bulk silicon material, which requires not only high fabrication costs but also limited performance. In this study, the fabrication of high-performance solar cells based on hybrid structure of silicon nanowires/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/graphene (SiNW/PEDOT:PSS/Gr) is focused upon. SiNWs with different lengths of 125, 400, 800 nm, and 2 µm are fabricated by a metal-assisted chemical etching method, and their influence on the performance of the hybrid solar cells is studied and investigated. The experimental results indicate that the suitable SiNW length for the fabrication of the hybrid solar cells is about 400 nm and the best power conversion efficiency obtained is about 9.05%, which is about 2.1 times higher than that of the planar Si solar cell. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conversion Efficiencies; Hybrid Solar Cells; Pedot:pss; Silicon Nanowires","","","","This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 104.06‐2018.34 and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under project ĐLTE00.03/19‐20.","Sarkın, Ali Samet, A review of anti-reflection and self-cleaning coatings on photovoltaic panels, Solar Energy, 199, pp. 63-73, (2020); Goel, Nipun, A review of nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collectors: Design considerations and experiments with hybrid PV/Thermal and direct steam generation collectors, Renewable Energy, 145, pp. 903-913, (2020); Sahoo, Mihir Kumar, Integration of silicon nanowires in solar cell structure for efficiency enhancement: A review, Journal of Materiomics, 5, 1, pp. 34-48, (2019); Khang, Dahlyoung, Recent progress in Si-PEDOT:PSS inorganic-organic hybrid solar cells, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 52, 50, (2019); Tian, Bozhi, Coaxial silicon nanowires as solar cells and nanoelectronic power sources, Nature, 449, 7164, pp. 885-889, (2007); Yuan, Guangbi, Understanding the origin of the low performance of chemically grown silicon nanowires for solar energy conversion, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 50, 10, pp. 2334-2338, (2011); Garnett, Erik Christian, Silicon nanowire radial p-n junction solar cells, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 130, 29, pp. 9224-9225, (2008); Sci Rep, (2015); Yoon, Sung-soo, Ag nanowire/PEDOT:PSS bilayer transparent electrode for high performance Si-PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells, Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, 129, pp. 128-132, (2019); Rui, Yunjun, Improved Performance of Silicon Nanowire-Based Solar Cells with Diallyl Disulfide Passivation, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 123, 8, pp. 4664-4673, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","20566646","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119504658"

However, dietary and behavioural determinants of blood cholesterol are changing rapidly throughout the world3 and countries are using lipid-lowering medications at varying rates. These changes can have distinct effects on the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, which have different effects on human health4,5. However, the trends of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol levels over time have not been previously reported in a global analysis. Here we pooled 1,127 population-based studies that measured blood lipids in 102.6 million individuals aged 18 years and older to estimate trends from 1980 to 2018 in mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol levels for 200 countries. Globally, there was little change in total or non-HDL cholesterol from 1980 to 2018. This was a net effect of increases in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and southeast Asia, and decreases in high-income western countries, especially those in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe. As a result, countries with the highest level of non-HDL cholesterol—which is a marker of cardiovascular risk—changed from those in western Europe such as Belgium, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Malta in 1980 to those in Asia and the Pacific, such as Tokelau, Malaysia, The Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, high non-HDL cholesterol was responsible for an estimated 3.9 million (95% credible interval 3.7 million–4.2 million) worldwide deaths, half of which occurred in east, southeast and south Asia. The global repositioning of lipid-related risk, with non-optimal cholesterol shifting from a distinct feature of high-income countries in northwestern Europe, north America and Australasia to one that affects countries in east and southeast Asia and Oceania should motivate the use of population-based policies and personal interventions to improve nutrition and enhance access to treatment throughout the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cholesterol, Hdl; Cholesterol, Ldl; Triglycerides; High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Triacylglycerol; Blood; Chemical Compound; Lipid; Nutrition; Protein; Public Health; Adult; Age Distribution; Article; Australia And New Zealand; Brain Ischemia; Cardiovascular Mortality; Cardiovascular Risk; Cholesterol Blood Level; Controlled Study; Disease Burden; Europe; Female; Geographic Distribution; High Income Country; Human; Lipid Analysis; Lipid Blood Level; Low Income Country; Male; Middle Income Country; Mortality Rate; North America; Population Research; Priority Journal; Sex Ratio; Southeast Asia; Trend Study; Young Adult; Adolescent; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Cerebrovascular Accident; Heart Muscle Ischemia; Hypercholesterolemia; International Cooperation; Middle Aged; Very Elderly; Arctic; Australasia; Greenland; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Bayes Theorem; Cholesterol, Hdl; Cholesterol, Ldl; Female; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Stroke; Triglycerides; Young Adult","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; blood; chemical compound; lipid; nutrition; protein; public health; adult; age distribution; Article; Australia and New Zealand; brain ischemia; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; disease burden; Europe; female; geographic distribution; high income country; human; lipid analysis; lipid blood level; low income country; male; middle income country; mortality rate; North America; population research; priority journal; sex ratio; Southeast Asia; trend study; young adult; adolescent; aged; Bayes theorem; cerebrovascular accident; heart muscle ischemia; hypercholesterolemia; international cooperation; middle aged; very elderly; Arctic; Australasia; Greenland; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bayes Theorem; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Stroke; Triglycerides; Young Adult","","Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Triglycerides","Funding text 1: Competing interests M.E. reports a charitable grant from the AstraZeneca Young Health Programme, and personal fees from Prudential, Scor and Third Bridge, outside the submitted work.

DNA in historical specimens is generally highly fragmented, complicating the recovery of high-grade genetic material. Furthermore, our understanding of hyperdiverse, wide-spread tree assemblages is obstructed by extensive species ranges, fragmented knowledge of tropical tree diversity and phenology, and a widespread lack of species-level diagnostic characters, prohibiting the collecting of readily identifiable specimens which can be used to build, revise or strengthen taxonomic frameworks. This, in turn, delays the application of downstream conservation action. A sizable component of botanical collections are sterile—thus eluding identification and are slowing down progress in systematic treatments of tropical biodiversity. With rapid advances in genomics and bioinformatic approaches to biodiversity research, museomics is emerging as a new field breathing life into natural collections that have been built up over centuries. Using MIGseq (multiplexed ISSR genotyping by sequencing), we generated 10,000s of short loci, for both freshly collected materials and museum specimens (aged >100 years) of Lithocarpus—a widespread tropical tree genus endemic to the Asian tropics. Loci recovery from historical and recently collected samples was not affected by sample age and preservation history of the study material, underscoring the reliability and flexibility of the MIGseq approach. Phylogenomic inference and biogeographic reconstruction across insular Asia, highlights repeated migration and diversification patterns between continental regions and islands. Results indicate that co-occurring insular species at the extremity of the distribution range are not monophyletic, raising the possibility of multiple independent dispersals along the outer edge of Wallacea. This suggests that dispersal of large seeded tree genera throughout Malesia and across Wallacea may have been less affected by large geographic distances and the presence of marine barriers than generally assumed. We demonstrate the utility of MIGseq in museomic studies using non-model taxa, presenting the first range-wide genomic assessment of Lithocarpus and tropical Fagaceae as a proof-of-concept.

The K6 was translated into the Vietnamese language following a standard procedure. A survey was conducted of nurses in a large general hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, using a questionnaire including the Vietnamese K6, other scales (DASS21, health-related QOL, self-rated health, and psychosocial work environment), and questions about demographic variables. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient) was calculated. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. Eleven hypotheses were tested (as Pearson’s correlations with the K6) to assess the scale’s construct validity. Item response theory (IRT) analysis was conducted to identify the item response characteristics. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.864. The explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a one-factor structure. Most hypotheses tested for construct validity were supported. IRT analysis indicated that response categories were located in order according to severity. K6 provided reliable information regarding higher levels of psychological distress. The findings suggest that the Vietnamese version of the K6 is a reliable and valid instrument to measure psychological distress among hospital nurses in Vietnam. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Confirmatory Factor Analysis; Construct Validity; Cronbach Alpha Coefficient; Demography; General Hospital; Human; Internal Consistency; Language; Mental Stress; Nurse; Quality Of Life; Questionnaire; Viet Nam; Work Environment; Adult; Clinical Trial; Female; Hospital; Male; Middle Aged; Multicenter Study; Psychometry; Self Report; Translating (language); Adult; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Psychometrics; Self Report; Surveys And Questionnaires; Translating; Vietnam","article; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; Cronbach alpha coefficient; demography; general hospital; human; internal consistency; language; mental stress; nurse; quality of life; questionnaire; Viet Nam; work environment; adult; clinical trial; female; hospital; male; middle aged; multicenter study; psychometry; self report; translating (language); Adult; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Psychometrics; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating; Vietnam","","","NK received a grant from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) under Grant Number JP18jk0110014 (https://www.amed.go.jp/).

Violation of this CP symmetry was first observed in 19641, and CP violation in the weak interactions of quarks was soon established2. Sakharov proposed3 that CP violation is necessary to explain the observed imbalance of matter and antimatter abundance in the Universe. However, CP violation in quarks is too small to support this explanation. So far, CP violation has not been observed in non-quark elementary particle systems. It has been shown that CP violation in leptons could generate the matter–antimatter disparity through a process called leptogenesis4. Leptonic mixing, which appears in the standard model’s charged current interactions5,6, provides a potential source of CP violation through a complex phase δ<inf>CP</inf>, which is required by some theoretical models of leptogenesis7–9. This CP violation can be measured in muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations and the corresponding antineutrino oscillations, which are experimentally accessible using accelerator-produced beams as established by the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) and NOvA experiments10,11. Until now, the value of δ<inf>CP</inf> has not been substantially constrained by neutrino oscillation experiments. Here we report a measurement using long-baseline neutrino and antineutrino oscillations observed by the T2K experiment that shows a large increase in the neutrino oscillation probability, excluding values of δ<inf>CP</inf> that result in a large increase in the observed antineutrino oscillation probability at three standard deviations (3σ). The 3σ confidence interval for δ<inf>CP</inf>, which is cyclic and repeats every 2π, is [−3.41, −0.03] for the so-called normal mass ordering and [−2.54, −0.32] for the inverted mass ordering. Our results indicate CP violation in leptons and our method enables sensitive searches for matter–antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations using accelerator-produced neutrino beams. Future measurements with larger datasets will test whether leptonic CP violation is larger than the CP violation in quarks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Confidence Interval; Cosmology; Electron; Experimental Study; Oscillation; Physics; Polarization; Article; Body Weight; Conjugation; Cosmos; Elementary Particle; Lepton; Neutrino; Parity; Probability; Quark; Theoretical Study","confidence interval; cosmology; electron; experimental study; oscillation; physics; polarization; article; body weight; conjugation; cosmos; elementary particle; lepton; neutrino; parity; probability; quark; theoretical study","","","Acknowledgements We thank the J-PARC staff for superb accelerator performance.

Those glands contain powerful cardiotonic steroids known as bufadienolides, which can be deployed as a defense against predators. Bufadienolides otherwise occur only in toads (Bufonidae) and some fireflies (Lampyrinae), which are known or believed to synthesize the toxins. The ancestral diet of Rhabdophis consists of anuran amphibians, and we have shown previously that the bufadienolide toxins of frog-eating species are sequestered from toads consumed as prey. However, one derived clade, the Rhabdophis nuchalis Group, has shifted its primary diet from frogs to earthworms. Here we confirm that the worm-eating snakes possess bufadienolides in their nucho-dorsal glands, although the worms themselves lack such toxins. In addition, we show that the bufadienolides of R. nuchalis Group species are obtained primarily from fireflies. Although few snakes feed on insects, we document through feeding experiments, chemosensory preference tests, and gut contents that lampyrine firefly larvae are regularly consumed by these snakes. Furthermore, members of the R. nuchalis Group contain compounds that resemble the distinctive bufadienolides of fireflies, but not those of toads, in stereochemistry, glycosylation, acetylation, and molecular weight. Thus, the evolutionary shift in primary prey among members of the R. nuchalis Group has been accompanied by a dramatic shift in the source of the species' sequestered defensive toxins. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bufadienolides; Chemical Defense; Firefly; Nuchal Glands; Rhabdophis; Bufadienolide; Bufadienolide; Bufanolides; Cardiac Glycosides; Toxins, Biological; Bufadienolide; Bufadienolide Derivative; Cardiac Glycoside; Toxin; Acetylation; Adult; Animal Experiment; Animal Food; Animal Tissue; Anura; Article; Chemosensitivity; Controlled Study; Dietary Pattern; Dorsal Region; Evolutionary Adaptation; Feeding; Female; Firefly; Glycosylation; Insect Larva; Intestine Content; Male; Molecular Weight; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Rhabdophis Nuchalis; Snake; Stereochemistry; Animal; Bufonidae; Chemistry; Colubridae; Defense Mechanism; Diet; Evolution; Feeding Behavior; Insect; Isolation And Purification; Larva; Oligochaeta; Physiology; Predation; Stereoisomerism; Animals; Biological Evolution; Bufanolides; Cardiac Glycosides; Defense Mechanisms; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Glycosylation; Insecta; Larva; Molecular Weight; Predatory Behavior; Snakes; Stereoisomerism; Toxins, Biological","bufadienolide; bufadienolide derivative; cardiac glycoside; toxin; acetylation; adult; animal experiment; animal food; animal tissue; Anura; Article; chemosensitivity; controlled study; dietary pattern; dorsal region; evolutionary adaptation; feeding; female; firefly; glycosylation; insect larva; intestine content; male; molecular weight; nonhuman; priority journal; Rhabdophis nuchalis; snake; stereochemistry; animal; Bufonidae; chemistry; Colubridae; defense mechanism; diet; evolution; feeding behavior; insect; isolation and purification; larva; Oligochaeta; physiology; predation; stereoisomerism; Animals; Biological Evolution; Bufanolides; Cardiac Glycosides; Defense Mechanisms; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Glycosylation; Insecta; Larva; Molecular Weight; Predatory Behavior; Snakes; Stereoisomerism; Toxins, Biological","","bufadienolide, 29565-35-3; bufadienolide; Bufanolides; Cardiac Glycosides; Toxins, Biological","Funding text 1: We thank Koshiro Eto and Chao-An Tu for field assistance; Tsutomu Hikida and Jean-Jay Mao for providing snakes; many other colleagues for collecting snakes in Japan; and the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan and Department of Wildlife Conservation, Sri Lanka for permission (Permit Nos.

Epidemiological surveillance showed that most human cutaneous anthrax cases occurred in association with animal dissection. Whole-genome sequences were obtained from six B. anthracis strains from human patients with cutaneous anthrax in the endemic area. Comparative genomic analysis showed that the genetic homogeneity among Vietnamese B. anthracis strains was very high. All Vietnamese B. anthracis strains belonged to the canSNP lineage of A.Br.011/009, which mostly consists of strains of the trans-Eurasian (TEA) group, including the most closely related strain, Carbosap. To clarify the genetic diversity of Vietnamese strains and strains belonging to A.Br.011/009 and A. Br.008/011 canSNP lineages, we applied a reference genome-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene-by-gene genomic analysis (whole-genome MLST) strategy. The phylogeny from core genome SNPs revealed that the Vietnamese strains were positioned close to each other; moreover, several SNPs specific to Vietnamese B. anthracis were identified. Whole-genome MLST analysis revealed the differences in the number of SNPs between Vietnamese strains, which could enable discrimination at the strain level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Bacillus Anthracis; Controlled Study; Dissection; Genetic Background; Genetic Variability; Human; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Surgery; Viet Nam; Anthrax; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Skin Disease; Genetics; Genomics; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Physiology; Anthrax; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Humans; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Skin Diseases, Bacterial; Vietnam","adult; article; Bacillus anthracis; controlled study; dissection; genetic background; genetic variability; human; nonhuman; phylogeny; single nucleotide polymorphism; surgery; Viet Nam; anthrax; bacterial genome; bacterial skin disease; genetics; genomics; isolation and purification; microbiology; multilocus sequence typing; physiology; Anthrax; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Humans; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Skin Diseases, Bacterial; Vietnam","","","AO, SI and SM greatly acknowledge financial support by Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED; Grant No. 18fk0108049).

Under pathological conditions, AIRE expression is induced in epidermal cells and promotes skin tumor development. This study aimed to clarify the role of AIRE in the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). AIRE expression was evaluated in six OSCC cell lines and in OSCC tissue specimens. Expression of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and MMP9 was elevated in 293A cells stably expressing AIRE, and conversely, was decreased in AIRE-knockout HSC3 OSCC cells when compared to the respective controls. Upregulation of STAT1, and ICAM in OSCC cells was confirmed in tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry. We provide evidence that AIRE exerts transcriptional control in cooperation with ETS1. Expression of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and MMP9 was increased in 293A cells upon Ets1 transfection, and coexpression of AIRE further increased the expression of these proteins. AIRE coprecipitated with ETS1 in a modified immunoprecipitation assay using formaldehyde crosslinking. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that promoter fragments of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, and MMP9 were enriched in the AIRE precipitates. These results indicate that AIRE is induced in OSCC and supports cancer-related gene expression in cooperation with ETS1. This is a novel function of AIRE in extrathymic tissues under the pathological condition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gamma Interferon Inducible Protein 10; Gelatinase B; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1; Apeced Protein; Ets1 Protein, Human; Proto-oncogene Protein C-ets-1; Transcription Factors; Autoimmune Regulator Protein; Cxcl11 Chemokine; Gamma Interferon Inducible Protein 10; Gelatinase B; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1; Stat1 Protein; Transcription Factor Ets 1; Ets1 Protein, Human; Transcription Factor; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Ca9-22 Cell Line; Cancer Tissue; Carcinogenesis; Cd-1 Mouse; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Controlled Study; Gene Expression; Genetic Transfection; Hek293-a Cell Line; Histopathology; Hsc-3 Cell Line; Human; Human Cell; Human Tissue; Immunohistochemistry; Mouse; Mouth Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Newborn; Nonhuman; Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Line; Promoter Region; Protein Expression; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Stable Expression; Transcription Regulation; Tumor Gene; Upregulation; Autoimmunity; Genetics; Hek293 Cell Line; Mouth Tumor; Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Transcription Initiation; Tumor Cell Line; Autoimmunity; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Gene Expression; Hek293 Cells; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proto-oncogene Protein C-ets-1; Transcription Factors; Transcriptional Activation","autoimmune regulator protein; CXCL11 chemokine; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; gelatinase B; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; STAT1 protein; transcription factor Ets 1; ETS1 protein, human; transcription factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Ca9-22 cell line; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; CD-1 mouse; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; gene expression; genetic transfection; HEK293-A cell line; histopathology; HSC-3 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; mouse; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; newborn; nonhuman; oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line; promoter region; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; stable expression; transcription regulation; tumor gene; upregulation; autoimmunity; genetics; HEK293 cell line; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; transcription initiation; tumor cell line; Autoimmunity; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Gene Expression; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1; Transcription Factors; Transcriptional Activation","","gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; gelatinase B, 146480-36-6; intercellular adhesion molecule 1, 126547-89-5; APECED protein; ETS1 protein, human; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1; Transcription Factors","This work was supported by JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, https://www. jsps.go.jp/english/index.html) KAKENHI [JP25462848 and JP16K11438] to K.S..

Undernourished children are more likely to experience cognitive, physical, and metabolic developmental impairments that can lead to later cardiovascular disease, reduced intellectual ability and school attainment, and reduced economic productivity in adulthood2. Child growth failure (CGF), expressed as stunting, wasting, and underweight in children under five years of age (0–59 months), is a specific subset of undernutrition characterized by insufficient height or weight against age-specific growth reference standards3–5. The prevalence of stunting, wasting, or underweight in children under five is the proportion of children with a height-for-age, weight-for-height, or weight-for-age z-score, respectively, that is more than two standard deviations below the World Health Organization’s median growth reference standards for a healthy population6. Subnational estimates of CGF report substantial heterogeneity within countries, but are available primarily at the first administrative level (for example, states or provinces)7; the uneven geographical distribution of CGF has motivated further calls for assessments that can match the local scale of many public health programmes8. Building from our previous work mapping CGF in Africa9, here we provide the first, to our knowledge, mapped high-spatial-resolution estimates of CGF indicators from 2000 to 2017 across 105 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 99% of affected children live1, aggregated to policy-relevant first and second (for example, districts or counties) administrative-level units and national levels. Despite remarkable declines over the study period, many LMICs remain far from the ambitious World Health Organization Global Nutrition Targets to reduce stunting by 40% and wasting to less than 5% by 2025. Large disparities in prevalence and progress exist across and within countries; our maps identify high-prevalence areas even within nations otherwise succeeding in reducing overall CGF prevalence. By highlighting where the highest-need populations reside, these geospatial estimates can support policy-makers in planning interventions that are adapted locally and in efficiently directing resources towards reducing CGF and its health implications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cardiovascular Disease; Child Health; Disease Prevalence; Geographical Distribution; Growth; Malnutrition; Morbidity; Mortality; Policy Making; Public Health; World Health Organization; Article; Child; Child Growth; Child Growth Failure; Geographic Distribution; Geographic Mapping; Growth Disorder; Health Care Disparity; Health Care Policy; Health Program; Health Status Indicator; Human; Infant; Low Income Country; Middle Income Country; Practice Guideline; Prevalence; Priority Journal; Risk Reduction; Underweight; Wasting Syndrome; Africa; Body Weight; Developing Country; Developmental Disorder; Newborn; Nutritional Disorder; Nutritional Status; Preschool Child; Time Factor; Body Weight; Child Nutrition Disorders; Child, Preschool; Developing Countries; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Nutritional Status; Time Factors","cardiovascular disease; child health; disease prevalence; geographical distribution; growth; malnutrition; morbidity; mortality; policy making; public health; World Health Organization; Article; child; child growth; child growth failure; geographic distribution; geographic mapping; growth disorder; health care disparity; health care policy; health program; health status indicator; human; infant; low income country; middle income country; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; risk reduction; underweight; wasting syndrome; Africa; body weight; developing country; developmental disorder; newborn; nutritional disorder; nutritional status; preschool child; time factor; Body Weight; Child Nutrition Disorders; Child, Preschool; Developing Countries; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Nutritional Status; Time Factors","","","Funding text 1: 1Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. 2Department of Health Metrics Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. 3Human Nutrition Department, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia. 4Department of Global Health, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa. 5Cochrane South Africa, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa. 6School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK. 7Lincoln Medical School, Universities of Nottingham & Lincoln, Lincoln, UK. 8School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA. 9National Malaria Elimination Program, Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja, Nigeria. 10Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 11Department of Family and Community Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 12Evidence Based Practice Center, Mayo Clinic Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Rochester, MN, USA. 13Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, Iran. 14Health Economics Department, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 15Health Management and Economics Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 16King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 17Health Services Management Department, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran. 18Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania. 19Department of Health Policy & Administration, University of the Philippines Manila, Manila, The Philippines. 20Department of Applied Social Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China. 21School of Health Sciences, Birmingham City University, Birmingham, UK. 22Preventive Medicine and Public Health Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 23Department of Health Informatics, University of Ha’il, Ha’il, Saudi Arabia. 24School of Business, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK. 25Department of Statistics and Econometrics, Bucharest University of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania. 26Center for Research in Evaluation and Surveys, National Public Health Institute, Cuernavaca, Mexico. 27Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, India. 28Public Health Foundation of India, Gurugram, India. 29The Judith Lumley Centre, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 30General Office for Research and Technological Transfer, Peruvian National Institute of Health, Lima, Peru. 31Public Health Risk Sciences Division, Public Health Agency of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 32Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 33Heidelberg Institute of Global Health (HIGH), Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany. 34T.

As a tool for promoting gender equity, it has gained increasing traction in popular media, international aid strategies, and global agenda-setting4–6. The global health agenda is increasingly focused on evidence of precision public health, which illustrates the subnational distribution of disease and illness7,8; however, an agenda focused on future equity must integrate comparable evidence on the distribution of social determinants of health9–11. Here we expand on the available precision SDG evidence by estimating the subnational distribution of educational attainment, including the proportions of individuals who have completed key levels of schooling, across all low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017. Previous analyses have focused on geographical disparities in average attainment across Africa or for specific countries, but—to our knowledge—no analysis has examined the subnational proportions of individuals who completed specific levels of education across all low- and middle-income countries12–14. By geolocating subnational data for more than 184 million person-years across 528 data sources, we precisely identify inequalities across geography as well as within populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Detection Method; Education; Educational Attainment; Equity; Gender; International Aid; Mapping Method; Public Health; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Africa; Article; Clinical Outcome; Educational Status; Evidence Based Practice; Geographic Distribution; Global Health; Health Care Disparity; Health Care Policy; Health Equity; Human; Low Income Country; Middle Income Country; Priority Journal; Sex Ratio; Social Determinants Of Health; Bayes Theorem; Developing Country; Female; Health Status; Male; Socioeconomics; Bayes Theorem; Developing Countries; Education; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Socioeconomic Factors","detection method; education; educational attainment; equity; gender; international aid; mapping method; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; Africa; Article; clinical outcome; educational status; evidence based practice; geographic distribution; global health; health care disparity; health care policy; health equity; human; low income country; middle income country; priority journal; sex ratio; social determinants of health; Bayes theorem; developing country; female; health status; male; socioeconomics; Bayes Theorem; Developing Countries; Education; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Socioeconomic Factors","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements This work was primarily supported by grant OPP1132415 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

We found that persulfidation (CysSSH) protects Cys from irreversible oxidative loss of function by the formation of CysSSO<inf>1-3</inf>H derivatives that can subsequently be reduced back to native thiols. Reductive reactivation of oxidized persulfides by the thioredoxin system was demonstrated in albumin, Prx2, and PTP1B. In cells, this mechanism protects and regulates key proteins of signaling pathways, including Prx2, PTEN, PTP1B, HSP90, and KEAP1. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that (i) CysSSH and CysSSO<inf>3</inf>H species are abundant in mouse liver and enzymatically regulated by the glutathione and thioredoxin systems and (ii) deletion of the thioredoxin-related protein TRP14 in mice altered CysSSH levels on a subset of proteins, predicting a role for TRP14 in persulfide signaling. Furthermore, selenium supplementation, polysulfide treatment, or knockdown of TRP14 mediated cellular responses to EGF, suggesting a role for TrxR1/TRP14-regulated oxidative persulfidation in growth factor responsiveness. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cysteine;

Forty-one shoulders of 41 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were examined. We evaluated synovitis, erosion and bone marrow edema, by counting the numbers of each positive site, and rotator cuff tears on shoulder MRI. The association between the shoulder tenderness and the MRI findings were statistically analyzed. Twenty-three of 41 patients had tenderness in the shoulder joints. There were 20 shoulders (48.8%) with rotator cuff tear, and no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of rotator cuff tear between the tenderness group and non-tenderness group (p = 0.080). There were no significant differences in the demographic data between these two groups. In MRI findings, we found significant difference for the synovitis (p = 0.001) and bone marrow edema (p = 0.021). Synovitis was strongly associated with the shoulder tenderness (OR: 3.996, 95% CI: 1.651–9.671). Synovitis was the factor most associated with shoulder tenderness. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bone Marrow; Complication; Cross-sectional Study; Diagnostic Imaging; Female; Human; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pain; Pathology; Retrospective Study; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injury; Shoulder; Synovitis; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Bone Marrow; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Retrospective Studies; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Shoulder; Synovitis; Young Adult","adolescent; adult; aged; bone marrow; complication; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; female; human; inflammation; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; pathology; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; rotator cuff; rotator cuff injury; shoulder; synovitis; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Bone Marrow; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Retrospective Studies; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Shoulder; Synovitis; Young Adult","","","","Pincus, Theodore, Severe functional declines, work disability, and increased mortality in seventy‐five rheumatoid arthritis patients studied over nine years, Arthritis and Rheumatism, 27, 8, pp. 864-872, (1984); Scott, David L., LONG-TERM OUTCOME OF TREATING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: RESULTS AFTER 20 YEARS, The Lancet, 329, 8542, pp. 1108-1111, (1987); Pathological Basis of the Connective Tissue Diseases, (1992); Olofsson, Yvonne, Shoulder joint involvement in patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, Scandinavian Journal of Rheumatology, 32, 1, pp. 25-32, (2003); Goldhahn, Jörg, Functional staging and surgical intervention of the elbow and shoulder joints in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, Nature Clinical Practice Rheumatology, 3, 2, pp. 112-117, (2007); Petersson, Claes J., Painful shoulders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Prevalence, clinical and radiological features, Scandinavian Journal of Rheumatology, 15, 3, pp. 275-279, (1986); Larsen, Arvi, Radiographic evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions by standard reference films, Acta Radiologica - Series Diagnosis, 18, 4, pp. 481-491, (1977); Sperling, John W., Total shoulder arthroplasty versus hemiarthroplasty for rheumatoid arthritis of the shoulder: Results of 303 consecutive cases, Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery, 16, 6, pp. 683-690, (2007); McQueen, Fiona, Bone marrow edema and osteitis in rheumatoid arthritis: the imaging perspective, Arthritis Research and Therapy, 14, 5, (2012); Amin, Mohammed Farghally, The Role of Ultrasonography in Early Detection and Monitoring of Shoulder Erosions, and Disease Activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients; Comparison with MRI Examination, Academic Radiology, 19, 6, pp. 693-700, (2012)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","31862930","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076913098"

Previous studies highlighted that upstream hydro-infrastructure developments impact flow regime, sediment and nutrient transport, bed and bank stability, fish productivity, biodiversity and biology of the basin. Here, we show that tidal amplification and saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta develop with alarming paces. While offshore M<inf>2</inf> tidal amplitude increases by 1.2–2 mm yr−1 due to sea level rise, tidal amplitude within the delta is increasing by 2 cm yr−1 and salinity in the channels is increasing by 0.2–0.5 PSU yr−1. We relate these changes to 2–3 m bed level incisions in response to sediment starvation, caused by reduced upstream sediment supply and downstream sand mining, which seems to be four times more than previous estimates. The observed trends cannot be explained by deeper channels due to relative sea level rise; while climate change poses grave natural hazards in the coming decades, anthropogenic forces drive short-term trends that already outstrip climate change effects. Considering the detrimental trends identified, it is imperative that the Mekong basin governments converge to effective transboundary management of the natural resources, before irreversible damage is made to the Mekong and its population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Special thanks to the personnel of the Southern Institute for Water Resources Planning (Ho Chi minh City, Vietnam), for openly supporting the project during its development.

The prevalences of women with preterm birth delivered by CS were 31.0% and 36.7% in GS and MCS, respectively. Compared with VB, CS was associated with significantly increased odds of maternal intensive care unit admission, maternal near miss, and neonatal intensive care unit admission but significantly decreased odds of fresh stillbirth, and perinatal death. However, since the information on justification for mode of delivery (MOD) were not available, our results of the potential benefits and harms of CS should be carefully considered when deciding MOD in preterm births. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Cesarean Section; Clinical Trial; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Female; Human; Multicenter Study; Newborn; Perinatal Death; Perinatal Mortality; Pregnancy; Prematurity; Prevalence; Randomized Controlled Trial; Stillbirth; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Perinatal Death; Perinatal Mortality; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Prevalence; Stillbirth","adult; cesarean section; clinical trial; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; multicenter study; newborn; perinatal death; perinatal mortality; pregnancy; prematurity; prevalence; randomized controlled trial; stillbirth; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Perinatal Death; Perinatal Mortality; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Prevalence; Stillbirth","","","This work was supported in part by M.

We performed whole genome sequencing of 332 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates collected from patients newly diagnosed with smear-positive pulmonary TB in Hanoi, Vietnam. Using a bacterial genome-wide approach based on linear mixed models, we investigated the associations between 31-bp k-mers and clustered strains harboring katG-S315T, a major INH-resistance mutation in the present cohort and in the second panel previously published in South Africa. Five statistically significant genes, namely, PPE18/19, gid, emrB, Rv1588c, and pncA, were shared by the two panels. We further identified variants of the genes responsible for these k-mers, which are relevant to the spread of INH-resistant strains. Phylogenetic convergence test showed that variants relevant to PPE46/47-like chimeric genes were significantly associated with the same phenotype in Hanoi. The associations were further confirmed after adjustment for the confounders. These findings suggest that genomic variations of the pathogen facilitate the expansion of INH-resistance TB, at least in part, and our study provides a new insight into the mechanisms by which drug-resistant Mtb maintains fitness and spreads in Asia and Africa. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Antibiotic Resistance; Bacterial Gene; Genetics; Genome-wide Association Study; Human; Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis; Mutation; Mutation Rate; Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; Prevalence; Statistical Model; Viet Nam; Whole Genome Sequencing; Adult; Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Genome-wide Association Study; Humans; Logistic Models; Mutation; Mutation Rate; Prevalence; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-resistant; Vietnam; Whole Genome Sequencing","adult; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; genetics; genome-wide association study; human; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; mutation; mutation rate; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; prevalence; statistical model; Viet Nam; whole genome sequencing; Adult; Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Logistic Models; Mutation; Mutation Rate; Prevalence; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; Vietnam; Whole Genome Sequencing","","","The authors would like to thank Dr. Luu Thi Lien for her leadership and Dr. Shinsaku Sakurada for his monitoring of the on-site implementation of the original cohort study, and Ms. Ikumi Matsushita for her technical support and resource contribution.

Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that foliar application of AA under control conditions improved mung bean growth, which was interlinked to enhanced levels of photosynthetic rate and pigments, improved water status and increased uptake of K+, in comparison with water-sprayed control. Mung bean plants exposed to salinity exhibited reduced growth and biomass production, which was emphatically correlated with increased accumulations of Na+, reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and impaired photosynthesis, as evidenced by PCA and heatmap clustering. AA supplementation ameliorated the toxic effects of seawater, and improved the growth performance of salinity-exposed mung bean. AA potentiated several physio-biochemical mechanisms that were connected to increased uptake of Ca2+ and Mg2+, reduced accumulation of toxic Na+, improved water use efficiency, enhanced accumulations of proline, total free amino acids and soluble sugars, increased catalase activity, and heightened levels of phenolics and flavonoids. Collectively, our results provided new insights into AA-mediated protective mechanisms against salinity in mung bean, thereby proposing AA as a potential and cost-effective chemical for the management of salt-induced toxicity in mung bean, and perhaps in other cash crops. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetic Acid; Potassium; Sodium; Water; Acetic Acid; Gases; Minerals; Pigments, Biological; Potassium; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sodium; Water; Acetic Acid; Mineral; Pigment; Potassium; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Sea Water; Sodium; Water; Biomass; Chemistry; Cost Benefit Analysis; Drug Effect; Economics; Evapotranspiration; Gas; Metabolism; Osmosis; Oxidative Stress; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Plant Leaf; Plant Stoma; Principal Component Analysis; Salinity; Vigna; Acetic Acid; Biomass; Cost-benefit Analysis; Gases; Minerals; Osmosis; Oxidative Stress; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Pigments, Biological; Plant Leaves; Plant Stomata; Plant Transpiration; Potassium; Principal Component Analysis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Salinity; Seawater; Sodium; Water","acetic acid; mineral; pigment; potassium; reactive oxygen metabolite; sea water; sodium; water; biomass; chemistry; cost benefit analysis; drug effect; economics; evapotranspiration; gas; metabolism; osmosis; oxidative stress; phenotype; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant stoma; principal component analysis; salinity; Vigna; Acetic Acid; Biomass; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Gases; Minerals; Osmosis; Oxidative Stress; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Pigments, Biological; Plant Leaves; Plant Stomata; Plant Transpiration; Potassium; Principal Component Analysis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Salinity; Seawater; Sodium; Water","","acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; water, 7732-18-5; Acetic Acid; Gases; Minerals; Pigments, Biological; Potassium; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sodium; Water","","Soil Pollution an Emerging Threat to Agriculture, (2017); El-Ashry, Mohamed T., Salinity pollution from irrigated agriculture., Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 40, 1, pp. 48-52, (1985); Cañedo-Argüelles, Miguel, Salinisation of rivers: An urgent ecological issue, Environmental Pollution, 173, pp. 157-167, (2013); Singh, Ajay, Soil salinization and waterlogging: A threat to environment and agricultural sustainability, Ecological Indicators, 57, pp. 128-130, (2015); Farooq, Muhammad Omer, Effects, tolerance mechanisms and management of salt stress in grain legumes, Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 118, pp. 199-217, (2017); Abdel Latef, Arafat Abdel Hamed, Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Improve Growth and Enhance Tolerance of Broad Bean Plants under Saline Soil Conditions, Land Degradation and Development, 29, 4, pp. 1065-1073, (2018); Cao, Dong, Adaptive Mechanisms of Soybean Grown on Salt-Affected Soils, Land Degradation and Development, 29, 4, pp. 1054-1064, (2018); Abiala, Moses Akindele, Salt stress tolerance mechanisms and potential applications of legumes for sustainable reclamation of salt-degraded soils, Land Degradation and Development, 29, 10, pp. 3812-3822, (2018); Bindumadhava, Hanumantharao, Salinity and high temperature tolerance in mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.)

The cotton blue-stained samples observed under light microscope revealed the formation of zoospores with germ tubes, appressoria and initiation of haustorium into the host cells, while the environmental scanning electron microscopy showed the rapid emergence of sporangiophores with dispersed sporangia around the stomata. For fluorescence microscopy, the infected leaf samples were stained with Fluorescent Brightener 28 and Calcofluor White, which react with β-glucans present in the mycelial walls, sporangiophores and sporangia. Calcoflour White was found to be the most suitable for studying the structural morphology of the pathogen. Therefore, samples observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were pre-treated with Calcofluor White, as well as with Syto-13 that can stain the cell nuclei. Among the four microscopic techniques, CLSM is ideal for observing live host-pathogen interaction and studying the developmental processes of the pathogen in the host tissues. The use of different microscopic bioimaging techniques to study pathogenesis will enhance our understanding of the morphological features and development of the infectious propagules in the host. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioassay; Cell Survival; Cytology; Microbiology; Microscopy; Pennisetum; Peronospora; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Three-dimensional Imaging; Ultrastructure; Biological Assay; Cell Survival; Imaging, Three-dimensional; Microscopy; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves","bioassay; cell survival; cytology; microbiology; microscopy; Pennisetum; Peronospora; plant disease; plant leaf; three-dimensional imaging; ultrastructure; Biological Assay; Cell Survival; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microscopy; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves","","","This research work has been carried out in the project Systemic Acquired Resistance funded by Danish International Development Agency under the Enhancement of Research Capacity Program (DANIDA-ENRECA).

Several hypotheses have proposed coastal, estuarine and riparian areas as sites of the transition. Here, we report the ecology of an amphibious fish Periophthalmodon septemradiatus, which we presume is in the process of niche expansion into terrestrial habitats from estuarine to freshwater environments along the Mekong River, Vietnam. Adult fish are highly terrestrial and have not been observed to venture into water during our survey. Courtship behaviour was observed, and fertilised eggs were recovered from burrows in both brackish and freshwater environments. The smallest fish collected at 12, 96, and 148 km from the river mouth were juveniles shortly after starting an amphibious life. These findings suggest reproduction in both brackish and freshwater environments. In contrast, otolith Sr:Ca ratio indicates larval hatching only in brackish water. Analysis of a 940-base pair (bp) segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II and a 934-bp segment of the mitochondrial D-loop demonstrated no genetic segregation between populations. The fish may provide a unique opportunity to study how ambient salinity affects the biology and ecology of a living vertebrate during transition from water to land. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cytochrome C Oxidase; Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit Ii; Dna, Mitochondrial; Electron Transport Complex Iv; Cytochrome C Oxidase; Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit Ii; Fresh Water; Mitochondrial Dna; Salt Water; Adaptation; Animal; Animal Behavior; Animal Dispersal; Body Size; Courtship; Ecosystem; Egg; Estuary; Female; Fish; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Male; Physiology; River; Salinity; Viet Nam; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Distribution; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Courtship; Dna, Mitochondrial; Ecosystem; Eggs; Electron Transport Complex Iv; Estuaries; Female; Fishes; Fresh Water; Male; Rivers; Saline Waters; Salinity; Vietnam","cytochrome c oxidase; cytochrome C oxidase subunit II; fresh water; mitochondrial DNA; salt water; adaptation; animal; animal behavior; animal dispersal; body size; courtship; ecosystem; egg; estuary; female; fish; genetics; growth, development and aging; male; physiology; river; salinity; Viet Nam; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Distribution; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Courtship; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ecosystem; Eggs; Electron Transport Complex IV; Estuaries; Female; Fishes; Fresh Water; Male; Rivers; Saline Waters; Salinity; Vietnam","","cytochrome c oxidase, 72841-18-0, 9001-16-5; cytochrome C oxidase subunit II; DNA, Mitochondrial; Electron Transport Complex IV","We are grateful to Dr. Natsumi Kudo at Marine Ecology Research Institute (Chiba, Japan) for her help in the determination of Sr concentration, to Rei Amano at AORI for EPMA analysis, and to Tomohiro Okamura at NU for ICP analysis.

In this work, we have employed this mechanism to destruct tumor spheroids. We first loaded gadolinium onto the surface of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) producing gadolinium-loaded MSN (Gd-MSN). When Gd-MSN was added to the tumor spheroids, we observed efficient uptake and uniform distribution of Gd-MSN. Gd-MSN also can be taken up into cancer cells and localize to a site just outside of the cell nucleus. Exposure of the Gd-MSN containing tumor spheroids to monochromatic X-ray beams resulted in almost complete destruction. Importantly, this effect was observed at an energy level of 50.25 keV, but not with 50.0 keV. These results suggest that it is possible to use precisely tuned monochromatic X-rays to destruct tumor mass loaded with high Z materials, while sparing other cells. Our experiments point to the importance of nanoparticles to facilitate loading of gadolinium to tumor spheroids and to localize at a site close to the nucleus. Because the nanoparticles can target to tumor, our study opens up the possibility of developing a new type of radiation therapy for cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gadolinium; Gadolinium; Gadolinium; Metal Nanoparticle; Chemistry; Female; Human; Metabolism; Multicellular Spheroid; Ovary Tumor; Pathology; Tumor Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Gadolinium; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Ovarian Neoplasms; Spheroids, Cellular; X-ray Therapy","gadolinium; metal nanoparticle; chemistry; female; human; metabolism; multicellular spheroid; ovary tumor; pathology; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Gadolinium; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Ovarian Neoplasms; Spheroids, Cellular; X-Ray Therapy","","gadolinium, 7440-54-2; Gadolinium","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. JP15K21764 (to FT).

Here, we report that strain application can change a direction of a heat current generated by magneto-thermoelectric effects. For demonstration, we used metallic magnets in a thin-film form, wherein the anomalous Ettingshausen effect mainly determines the direction of the heat flow. Strain application can alter the magnetization direction owing to the magnetoelastic effect. As a result, the heat current, which is in the direction of the cross product of the charge current and the magnetization vector, can be switched or rotated simply by applying a tensile strain to the metallic magnets. We demonstrate 180° switching and 90° rotation of the heat currents in an in-plane magnetized Ni sample on a rigid sapphire substrate and a perpendicularly magnetized TbFeCo film on a flexible substrate, respectively. An active thermography technique was used to capture the strain-induced change in the heat current direction. The method presented here provides a novel method for controlling thermal energy in electronic devices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank Tomohiro Koyama, Yuki Hibino, Takahiro Namazu, Taishi Takenobu, and Shimpei Ono for their technical help.

When activated, Ire1 splices and matures the HAC1 mRNA which encodes a transcription-factor protein that is responsible for the gene induction of the UPR. Here we propose that this signaling pathway is also used in cellular adaptation upon diauxic shift, in which cells shift from fermentative phase (fast growth) to mitochondrial respiration phase (slower growth). Splicing of the HAC1 mRNA was induced upon diauxic shift of cells cultured in glucose-based media or in cells transferred from glucose-based medium to non-fermentable glycerol-based medium. Activation of Ire1 in this situation was not due to ER accumulation of unfolded proteins, and was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are byproducts of aerobic respiration. Here we also show that the UPR induced by diauxic shift causes enlargement of the mitochondria, and thus contributes to cellular growth under non-fermentative conditions, in addition to transcriptional induction of the canonical UPR target genes, which includes those encoding ER-located molecular chaperones and protein-folding enzymes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein Serine Threonine Kinase; Basic-leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Hac1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Ire1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Membrane Glycoproteins; Protein-serine-threonine Kinases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Proteins; Basic Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor; Hac1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Ire1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Membrane Protein; Protein Serine Threonine Kinase; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Repressor Protein; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Protein; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Mitochondrion; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Unfolded Protein Response; Basic-leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mitochondria; Protein-serine-threonine Kinases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Proteins; Unfolded Protein Response","basic leucine zipper transcription factor; HAC1 protein, S cerevisiae; IRE1 protein, S cerevisiae; membrane protein; protein serine threonine kinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; repressor protein; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; endoplasmic reticulum; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mitochondrion; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; unfolded protein response; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mitochondria; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Unfolded Protein Response","","protein serine threonine kinase; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; HAC1 protein, S cerevisiae; IRE1 protein, S cerevisiae; Membrane Glycoproteins; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins","We deeply thank to Prof. Kenji Kohno and Prof. Hiroshi Takagi (Nara Inst.

However, their influence on landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) remains poorly constrained. This work determined the scale dependency of DEM-derived geomorphometric factors in LSM using a 5 m LiDAR DEM, LiDAR resampled 30 m DEM, and a 30 m ASTER DEM. To verify the validity of our approach, we first compiled an inventory map comprising of 267 landslides for Sihjhong watershed, Taiwan, from 2004 to 2014. Twelve landslide causative factors were then generated from the DEMs and ancillary data. Afterward, popular statistical and machine learning techniques, namely, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented to produce the LSM. The accuracies of models were evaluated by overall accuracy, kappa index and the receiver operating characteristic curve indicators. The highest accuracy was attained from the resampled 30 m LiDAR DEM derivatives, indicating a fine-resolution topographic data does not necessarily achieve the best performance. Additionally, RF attained superior performance between the three presented models. Our findings could contribute to opt for an appropriate DEM resolution for mapping landslide hazard in vulnerable areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Landslide; Random Forest; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Support Vector Machine; Taiwan; Validity; Watershed","article; landslide; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; support vector machine; Taiwan; validity; watershed","","","This research is partially supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

We investigated the effects of BBR on the mechanisms of mucosal CD4+T cell activation in vitro and on the inflammatory responses in T cell transfer mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the favorable effects of BBR in vitro, using lamina propria (LP) CD4+ T cells in T cell transfer IBD models in which SCID mice had been injected with CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells. BBR suppressed the frequency of IFN-γ- and Il-17A-producing LP CD4+ T cells. This effect was found to be regulated by AMPK activation possibly induced by oxidative phosphorylation inhibition. We then examined the effects of BBR on the same IBD models in vivo. BBR-fed mice showed AMPK activation in the LPCD4+ T cells and an improvement of colitis. Our study newly showed that the BBR-induced AMPK activation of mucosal CD4+ T cells resulted in an improvement of IBD and underscored the importance of AMPK activity in colonic inflammation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adenosine Triphosphate; Berberine; Gamma Interferon; Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Kinase; Adenosine Triphosphate; Amp-activated Protein Kinases; Berberine; Cytokines; Inflammation Mediators; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-17; Adenosine Triphosphate; Autacoid; Berberine; Cytokine; Gamma Interferon; Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Kinase; Interleukin 17; Animal; Bagg Albino Mouse; Biosynthesis; Cd4+ T Lymphocyte; Chronic Disease; Colitis; Drug Effect; Enzyme Activation; Immunology; Intestine Flora; Metabolism; Microbiology; Mucosa; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Phylogeny; Scid Mouse; Signal Transduction; Th1 Cell; Th17 Cell; Adenosine Triphosphate; Amp-activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Berberine; Cd4-positive T-lymphocytes; Chronic Disease; Colitis; Cytokines; Enzyme Activation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Inflammation Mediators; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-17; Mice, Inbred Balb C; Mice, Scid; Mucous Membrane; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Phylogeny; Signal Transduction; Th1 Cells; Th17 Cells","adenosine triphosphate; autacoid; berberine; cytokine; gamma interferon; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; interleukin 17; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; chronic disease; colitis; drug effect; enzyme activation; immunology; intestine flora; metabolism; microbiology; mucosa; oxidative phosphorylation; phylogeny; SCID mouse; signal transduction; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Adenosine Triphosphate; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Berberine; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Chronic Disease; Colitis; Cytokines; Enzyme Activation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Inflammation Mediators; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-17; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, SCID; Mucous Membrane; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Phylogeny; Signal Transduction; Th1 Cells; Th17 Cells","","adenosine triphosphate, 15237-44-2, 56-65-5, 987-65-5; berberine, 2086-83-1, 633-65-8; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase, 172522-01-9, 72060-32-3; Adenosine Triphosphate; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Berberine; Cytokines; Inflammation Mediators; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-17","","Kaser, Arthur, Inflammatory bowel disease, Annual Review of Immunology, 28, pp. 573-621, (2010); Totsuka, Teruji, Immunosenescent colitogenic CD4+ T cells convert to regulatory cells and suppress colitis, European Journal of Immunology, 38, 5, pp. 1275-1286, (2008); Imenshahidi, Mohsen, Pharmacological and therapeutic effects of Berberis vulgaris and its active constituent, berberine, Phytotherapy Research, 22, 8, pp. 999-1012, (2008); Akkol, Esra Kupeli, A comparative study on the anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antipyretic effects of isoquinoline alkaloids from the roots of Turkish Berberis species, Life Sciences, 72, 6, pp. 645-657, (2002); Kong, Weijia, Berberine reduces insulin resistance through protein kinase C-dependent up-regulation of insulin receptor expression, Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental, 58, 1, pp. 109-119, (2009); Nishino, Hoyoku, Berberine sulfate inhibits tumor-promoting activity of teleocidin in two-stage carcinogenesis on mouse skin, Oncology (Switzerland), 43, 2, pp. 131-134, (1986); Cui, Guoliang, Berberine differentially modulates the activities of ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK to suppress Th17 and Th1 T cell differentiation in type 1 diabetic mice, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 284, 41, pp. 28420-28429, (2009); Qin, Xia, Regulation of Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation and amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by natural product compound berberine, Journal of Immunology, 185, 3, pp. 1855-1863, (2010); Jin, Yingli, Berberine enhances the AMPK activation and autophagy and mitigates high glucose-induced apoptosis of mouse podocytes, European Journal of Pharmacology, 794, pp. 106-114, (2017); Lee, Yunsok, Berberine, a natural plant product, activates AMP-activated protein kinase with beneficial metabolic effects in diabetic and insulin-resistant states, Diabetes, 55, 8, pp. 2256-2264, (2006)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","31417110","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070768696"

The spin-polarized SCAN + rVV10 method with an 8-atom primitive unit cell provides lattice parameters consistent with the experimental results over the entire pressure range, including the epsilon-zeta structural phase transition at high pressure, but does not provide accurate values of the intermolecular distances d<inf>1</inf> and d<inf>2</inf> at low pressure. The agreement between the intermolecular distances and the experimental values is greatly improved when a 16-atom conventional unit cell is used. Therefore, the SCAN + rVV10 method with a 16-atom unit cell can be considered the most suitable model for the epsilon phase of solid oxygen. The spin-polarized SCAN + rVV10 model predicts a magnetic phase at low pressure. Since the lattice parameters of the predicted magnetic structure are consistent with the experimental lattice parameters measured at room temperature, our results may suggest that the epsilon phase is magnetic even at room temperature. The GGA + vdW-D + U (with an ad hoc value of U<inf>eff</inf> = 2 eV at low pressure instead of the first-principles value of Ulr<inf>eff</inf> ~ 9 eV) and hybrid functional methods provide similar results to the SCAN + rVV10 method; however, they do not provide reasonable values for the intermolecular distances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research was supported by MEXT through the “Exploratory Challenge on Post-K computer” (Frontiers of Basic Science: Challenging the Limits) and the RIKEN iTHES Project.

Epidemiologically, H5 HPAIVs were frequently detected in apparently healthy domestic and Muscovy ducks and therefore these are preferred species for H5 HPAIV detection in active surveillance. Virologically, clade 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs were predominant and exhibited distinct phylogeographic evolution. Clade 2.3.2.1c viruses clustered phylogenetically in North, Central and South regions, whilst clade 2.3.4.4 viruses only detected in North and Central regions formed small groups. These viruses underwent diverse reassortment with existence of at least 12 genotypes and retained typical avian-specific motifs. These H5 HPAIVs exhibited large antigenic distance from progenitor viruses and commercial vaccines currently used in poultry. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis inferred that clade 2.3.2.1c viruses detected during 2014–2017 were likely descended from homologous clade viruses imported to Vietnam previously and/or preexisting Chinese viruses during 2012–2013. Vietnamese clade 2.3.4.4 viruses closely shared genetic traits with contemporary foreign spillovers, suggesting that there existed multiple transboundary virus dispersals to Vietnam. This study provides insights into the evolution of Vietnamese H5 HPAIVs and highlights the necessity of strengthening control measures such as, preventive surveillance and poultry vaccination. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibodies, Viral; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Hemagglutinin, Avian Influenza A Virus; Hemagglutinin, Avian Influenza A Virus; Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin; Virus Antibody; Animal; Antigenic Variation; Avian Influenza; Bird Disease; Chicken; Classification; Cross Reaction; Duck; Genetic Variation; Genetics; Health Survey; Immunology; Influenza A Virus; Isolation And Purification; Medical Geography; Molecular Evolution; Phylogeny; Vaccination; Viet Nam; Virology; Virus Gene; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Antigenic Variation; Chickens; Cross Reactions; Ducks; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Viral; Genetic Variation; Geography, Medical; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza In Birds; Phylogeny; Population Surveillance; Poultry Diseases; Vaccination; Vietnam","hemagglutinin, avian influenza A virus; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; virus antibody; animal; antigenic variation; avian influenza; bird disease; chicken; classification; cross reaction; duck; genetic variation; genetics; health survey; immunology; Influenza A virus; isolation and purification; medical geography; molecular evolution; phylogeny; vaccination; Viet Nam; virology; virus gene; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Antigenic Variation; Chickens; Cross Reactions; Ducks; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Viral; Genetic Variation; Geography, Medical; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza in Birds; Phylogeny; Population Surveillance; Poultry Diseases; Vaccination; Vietnam","","Antibodies, Viral; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; hemagglutinin, avian influenza A virus","We are sincerely grateful to the Vietnam DAH, especially Drs.

Recent progress in molecular phylogenomics has provided detailed and important information for evolutionary biology and taxonomy. Here we focused on the freshwater viviparid snails (Cipangopaludina chinensis chinensis and C. c. laeta) of East Asia. We conducted phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimation using two mitochondrial markers. We also performed population genetic analyses using genome-wide SNPs. We investigated how and which phylogenetic patterns reflect shell morphology. The results showed these two species could be separated into four major mitochondrial clades, whereas the nuclear clusters supported two groups. The phylogenetic patterns of both mtDNA and nDNA largely reflected the geographical distribution. Shell morphology reflected the phylogenetic clusters based on nDNA. The findings also showed these two species diversified in the Pliocene to early Pleistocene era, and occurred introgressive hybridisation. The results also raise the taxonomic issue of the two species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Mitochondrial; Mitochondrial Dna; Anatomy And Histology; Animal; Animal Shell; Cell Nucleus; Classification; Dna Sequence; Far East; Gene Locus; Genetics; High Throughput Sequencing; Mitochondrion; Molecular Evolution; Phylogeny; Population Genetics; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Snail; Animal Shells; Animals; Cell Nucleus; Dna, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Loci; Genetics, Population; High-throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Mitochondria; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, Dna; Snails","mitochondrial DNA; anatomy and histology; animal; animal shell; cell nucleus; classification; DNA sequence; Far East; gene locus; genetics; high throughput sequencing; mitochondrion; molecular evolution; phylogeny; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; snail; Animal Shells; Animals; Cell Nucleus; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Loci; Genetics, Population; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Mitochondria; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Snails","","DNA, Mitochondrial","We thank C.

The odds ratios of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema for anthropometric factors were estimated using logistic regression analysis. In total, 1202 children participated in the follow-up survey. The proportions of children who had current asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema were 5.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9–6.5%), 11.5% (9.7–13.4%), and 6.7% (5.3–8.2%), respectively. Low birthweight (adjusted odds ratio 5.12, 95% CI 1.92–13.64) was independently associated with increased risk of eczema. Further studies are necessary to understand the involved mechanism. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age; Allergic Conjunctivitis; Asthma; Child; Disease Predisposition; Eczema; Female; Follow Up; Health Survey; Human; Hypersensitivity; Male; Morphometry; Newborn; Pregnancy; Risk Assessment; Risk Factor; Viet Nam; Age Factors; Asthma; Body Weights And Measures; Child; Conjunctivitis, Allergic; Disease Susceptibility; Eczema; Female; Follow-up Studies; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pregnancy; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Vietnam","age; allergic conjunctivitis; asthma; child; disease predisposition; eczema; female; follow up; health survey; human; hypersensitivity; male; morphometry; newborn; pregnancy; risk assessment; risk factor; Viet Nam; Age Factors; Asthma; Body Weights and Measures; Child; Conjunctivitis, Allergic; Disease Susceptibility; Eczema; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pregnancy; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Vietnam","","","This was a collaborative research effort between Nagasaki University (Japan), National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (Vietnam), and Khanh Hoa Provincial Public Health Service (Vietnam).

Results suggest that an initial “first layer” of AMH had related closely to ancestral Andaman, Australian, Papuan, and Jomon groups who likely entered this region via the Southeast Asian landmass, prior to 65–50 kya. A later “second layer” shared strong cranial affinities with Siberians, implying a Northeast Asian source, evidenced by 9 kya in central China and then followed by expansions of descendant groups into Southeast Asia after 4 kya. These two populations shared limited initial exchange, and the second layer grew at a faster rate and in greater numbers, linked with contexts of farming that may have supported increased population densities. Clear dichotomization between the two layers implies a temporally deep divergence of distinct migration routes for AMH through both southern and northern Eurasia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Worker; Article; Brain; China; Controlled Study; Craniometry; Human; Major Clinical Study; Population Density; Progeny; Southeast Asia; Anatomy And Histology; Archeology; Far East; History; Migration; Skull; Archaeology; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Skull","agricultural worker; article; brain; China; controlled study; craniometry; human; major clinical study; population density; progeny; Southeast Asia; anatomy and histology; archeology; Far East; history; migration; skull; Archaeology; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Skull","","","This study was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JPS 16H02527) and the Australian Research Council (DP 110101097 and 150104458).

We developed an open collaborative forecasting challenge to assess probabilistic forecasts for seasonal epidemics of dengue, a major global public health problem. Sixteen teams used a variety of methods and data to generate forecasts for 3 epidemiological targets (peak incidence, the week of the peak, and total incidence) over 8 dengue seasons in Iquitos, Peru and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Forecast skill was highly variable across teams and targets. While numerous forecasts showed high skill for midseason situational awareness, early season skill was low, and skill was generally lowest for high incidence seasons, those for which forecasts would be most valuable. A comparison of modeling approaches revealed that average forecast skill was lower for models including biologically meaningful data and mechanisms and that both multimodel and multiteam ensemble forecasts consistently outperformed individual model forecasts. Leveraging these insights, data, and the forecasting framework will be critical to improve forecast skill and the application of forecasts in real time for epidemic preparedness and response. Moreover, key components of this project-integration with public health needs, a common forecasting framework, shared and standardized data, and open participation-can help advance infectious disease forecasting beyond dengue. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dengue; Epidemic; Forecast; Peru; Puerto Rico; Article; Demography; Dengue; Epidemic; Health Care Need; Human; Incidence; Peru; Prediction And Forecasting; Primary Prevention; Priority Journal; Probability; Public Health Problem; Puerto Rico; Seasonal Variation; Secondary Prevention; Tropic Climate","Article; demography; dengue; epidemic; health care need; human; incidence; Peru; prediction and forecasting; primary prevention; priority journal; probability; public health problem; Puerto Rico; seasonal variation; secondary prevention; tropic climate","","","Funding text 1: T.K.Y. and J.S. were supported by National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Grant GM110748 and Defense Threat Reduction Agency Contract HDTRA1-15-C-0018.

The present study demonstrates that the transition energies (Pi*, Sigma*, and the continuum) increase with compression, and the slopes of the pressure dependences then change at 94 GPa. The change in the slopes indicates that the electronic structure changes at the metallic transition. The change in the Pi* and Sigma* bands implies metallic characteristics of dense solid oxygen not only in the crystal a–b plane but also parallel to the c axis. The pressure evolution of the spectra also changes at ∼40 GPa. The experimental results are qualitatively reproduced in the calculations, indicating that dense solid oxygen transforms from insulator to metal via the semimetallic transition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dense Solid Oxygen; Dft Calculation; Electronic Structure; Insulator–metal Transition; X-ray Raman Scattering; Oxygen; Oxygen; Ab Initio Calculation; Article; Compression; Controlled Study; Crystal Structure; Density Functional Theory; Phase Transition; Pressure; Priority Journal; Raman Spectrometry; X Ray Raman Scattering Spectroscopy","oxygen; ab initio calculation; Article; compression; controlled study; crystal structure; density functional theory; phase transition; pressure; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; X ray Raman scattering spectroscopy","","oxygen, 7782-44-7","Funding text 1: The authors thank Takahiro Matsuoka and Jun-ichi Yamada for fruitful discussions.

To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2—to end preventable child deaths by 2030—we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000–2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mapping Method; Mortality; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Survival; United Nations; Article; Child; Child Death; Controlled Study; Human; Infant; Investment; Live Birth; Middle Income Country; Mortality Rate; Newborn; Childhood Mortality; Geography; Global Health; Infant Mortality; Organization; Public Health; Socioeconomics; Child; Child Mortality; Geography; Global Health; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Organizational Objectives; Public Health; Socioeconomic Factors","mapping method; mortality; spatiotemporal analysis; survival; United Nations; article; child; child death; controlled study; human; infant; investment; live birth; middle income country; mortality rate; newborn; childhood mortality; geography; global health; infant mortality; organization; public health; socioeconomics; Child; Child Mortality; Geography; Global Health; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Organizational Objectives; Public Health; Socioeconomic Factors","","","Funding text 1: Competing interests This study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates; Funding text 2: 593Medical Parasitology Department, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. 594Global Health Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. 595Department of Health Management and Economics, A.C.S.

It was found that the aggregation number increased with the decreasing carbon chain length. Furthermore, Br− significantly enhanced the micellar formation over Cl−. However, the aggregation number and ionization degree remain similar for both anions. The modelling results validate that the counter-anions affect micellar formation via equilibrium constants, instead of their hydration size. In particular, the association constants between surfactant (both monomer and micelle) and Br− are significantly higher than Cl−. This is consistent with the qualitative description of hydrated Br− in the literature. The experimental and modelling results confirm that micelles are formed via “ion-paring/hydration” structure, instead of the conventional “packing” concept. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemical Engineering; Conductivity; Micelles; Physical Chemistry; Surfactants","","","","","Rosen, Milton J., Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena: Fourth Edition, (2012); McBain, James William, CCXV. - Studies of the constitution of soap in solution: Sodium myristate and sodium laurate, Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions, 101, pp. 2042-2056, (1912); Aqueous Solutions of Paraffin Chain Salts, (1936); Tanford, Charles, Micelle shape and size, Journal of Physical Chemistry, 76, 21, pp. 3020-3024, (1972); Long, Joshua A., Micelle Structure and Hydrophobic Hydration, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 137, 33, pp. 10809-10815, (2015); Maibaum, Lutz, Micelle formation and the hydrophobic effect, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 108, 21, pp. 6778-6781, (2004); Geng, Yan, Specific ion pairing and interfacial hydration as controlling factors in gemini micelle morphology.

The core sample included 110 adult (aged ≥ 18 years) individuals, while comparisons are made with an additional six skeletal series from Neolithic through to Iron Age Vietnam, Thailand, and Mongolia. All post cranial skeletal elements were assessed for signs of healed trauma and identified cases were further x-rayed. Crude trauma prevalence (14/110, 12.7%) was not significantly different between males (8/52) and females (5/37) (χ2 = 0.061, p = 0.805). Nor were there significant differences in the prevalence of fractured limbs, although males displayed greater rates of lower limb bone trauma than females. Further, distinct from females, half the injured males suffered vertebral fractures, consistent with high-energy trauma. The first hypothesis is supported, while some support for the sexual divisions of labour was found. The prevalence and pattern of fractured limbs at CCN when compared with other Southeast and East Asian sites is most similar to the agropastoral site of Lamadong, China. The potential for skeletal trauma to assess animal trapping and herding practices prior to domestication in the past is discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Adult; Animal Trapping; Article; Bone Injury; Bone Radiography; Child; Controlled Study; Domestication; Female; Geographic Distribution; Human; Hunter-gatherer; Infant; Iron Age; Limb Fracture; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Aged; Nonhuman; Prevalence; School Child; Sex Difference; Social Behavior; Spine Fracture; Viet Nam; Wild Animal; Animal; Environment; Fracture; Human Activities; Leisure; Animals; Animals, Wild; Domestication; Environment; Female; Fractures, Bone; Hobbies; Human Activities; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Vietnam","adolescent; adult; animal trapping; Article; bone injury; bone radiography; child; controlled study; domestication; female; geographic distribution; human; hunter-gatherer; infant; Iron Age; limb fracture; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonhuman; prevalence; school child; sex difference; social behavior; spine fracture; Viet Nam; wild animal; animal; environment; fracture; human activities; leisure; Animals; Animals, Wild; Domestication; Environment; Female; Fractures, Bone; Hobbies; Human Activities; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Vietnam","","","Grant sponsors were: Australian Research Council DP110101097; FT 120100299 awarded to MO; Institute of Advanced Study (IAS), Durham University and the COFUND’Durham International Fellowships for Research and Enterprise’ scheme.

Despite their importance for ecosystem functioning, few quantitative, spatially explicit models of the active belowground community currently exist. In particular, nematodes are the most abundant animals on Earth, filling all trophic levels in the soil food web. Here we use 6,759 georeferenced samples to generate a mechanistic understanding of the patterns of the global abundance of nematodes in the soil and the composition of their functional groups. The resulting maps show that 4.4 ± 0.64 × 1020 nematodes (with a total biomass of approximately 0.3 gigatonnes) inhabit surface soils across the world, with higher abundances in sub-Arctic regions (38% of total) than in temperate (24%) or tropical (21%) regions. Regional variations in these global trends also provide insights into local patterns of soil fertility and functioning. These high-resolution models provide the first steps towards representing soil ecological processes in global biogeochemical models and will enable the prediction of elemental cycling under current and future climate scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Carbon; Soil; Organic Carbon; Soil Organic Carbon; Unclassified Drug; Carbon; Abundance; Biomass; Biosphere; Community Composition; Ecosystem Function; Food Web; Functional Group; Global Perspective; Soil Ecosystem; Soil Fauna; Soil Fertility; Subarctic Region; Trophic Level; Article; Bacterivore; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Climate Change; Herbivore; Machine Learning; Measurement Accuracy; Microbial Biomass; Mycophage; Nematode; Nonhuman; Omnivore; Ph; Population Abundance; Precipitation; Predator; Prediction; Priority Journal; Soil Moisture; Species Composition; Trend Study; Animal; Chemistry; Classification; Geographic Mapping; Isolation And Purification; Metabolism; Parasitology; Phylogeography; Reproducibility; Soil; Uncertainty; Animalia; Nematoda; Animals; Biomass; Carbon; Geographic Mapping; Phylogeography; Reproducibility Of Results; Soil; Uncertainty","organic carbon; soil organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; abundance; biomass; biosphere; community composition; ecosystem function; food web; functional group; global perspective; soil ecosystem; soil fauna; soil fertility; subarctic region; trophic level; Article; bacterivore; biodiversity; biogeochemistry; climate change; herbivore; machine learning; measurement accuracy; microbial biomass; mycophage; nematode; nonhuman; omnivore; pH; population abundance; precipitation; predator; prediction; priority journal; soil moisture; species composition; trend study; animal; chemistry; classification; geographic mapping; isolation and purification; metabolism; parasitology; phylogeography; reproducibility; soil; uncertainty; Animalia; Nematoda; Animals; Biomass; Carbon; Geographic Mapping; Phylogeography; Reproducibility of Results; Soil; Uncertainty","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Soil","Acknowledgements This research was supported by a grant from DOB Ecology to T.W.C., a grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (grant 016.Veni.181.078) to S.G., grants from NSF (OPP 1115245, 1341736, 0840979) to B.J.A., by a Ramon y Cajal fellow award (RYC-2016-19939) to R.C.H., a grant from UNEP & Global Environment Facility to J.E.C., a grant from NERC (NE/M017036/1) to T.C., a grant from FAPEMIG/FAPESP/VALE S.A.(CRA-RDP-00136-10) to L.B.C., through the strategic programme UID/ BIA/04050/2013 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007569) awarded to S.R.C., a grant from CNPq PROTAX (562346/2010-4) to J.M.d.C.C., a grant from DFG (CRC990) to V.K. and S.S., a grant from the MSHE of Russia (AAAA-A17-117112850234-5) to A.A.K., grants from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB15010402) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877047) to Q.L., grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31330011, 31170484) to W.L., grants from NERC (NE/M017036/1) to M.M., grants from the Spanish Ministry of Innovation (CGL2009-14686-C02-01/ 02, CGL2013-43675-P) to J.A.R.M., grants from NSF (DEB-0450537, DEB-1145440) to P.M., T.O.P. and K.

Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study at a national tertiary hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Participants were adult patients (age 18 years) who were admitted and diagnosed with ARDS during 2015–2017. Data on patients’ general and clinical conditions, radiographic findings, ventilator settings, gas exchange, and treatment methods were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Risk factors for mortality were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Results Among 126 eligible patients with ARDS admitted to the central tertiary hospital in Vietnam, we observed high mortality (57.1%). Of the total patients, 91.3% were transferred from local hospitals with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia and then diagnosed with ARDS at the central hospital. At the time of admission, 53.2% of patients had severe ARDS, 37.3% had moderate ARDS, and 9.5% had mild ARDS. The mean (standard deviation) sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 9.5 (3.4) in non-survivors and 7.4 (3.4) in survivors (p = 0.002). Although there was no significant difference in PaO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> on admission between non-survivors and survivors, that on day 3 after admission was significantly different (p = 0.002). Logistic regression revealed that PaO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> on day 3 [odds ratio (OR), 1.010; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.003–1.017], length of stay in a local hospital before admission to the central hospital (OR, 1.122; 95% CI, 1.042–1.210) due to stable condition, and SOFA score on Day 1 (OR, 0.842; 95% CI, 0.708–1.002) were independent factors in patient survival. Conclusions Patients with ARDS admitted the central tertiary hospital had severe illness and high mortality. Most patients were transferred from local hospitals. Improvements in human, medical, and sociological resources in local will contribute to reducing the mortality of ARDS in Vietnam. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Article; Disease Severity; Female; Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen; Hospital Admission; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mortality Rate; Observational Study; Oxygen Tension; Pneumonia; Respiratory Tract Parameters; Retrospective Study; Risk Factor; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; Survival Rate; Tertiary Care Center; Trend Study; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Disease Free Survival; Epidemiology; Middle Aged; Mortality; Adolescent; Adult; Disease-free Survival; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Vietnam","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; disease severity; female; fraction of inspired oxygen; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; observational study; oxygen tension; pneumonia; respiratory tract parameters; retrospective study; risk factor; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; survival rate; tertiary care center; trend study; Viet Nam; adolescent; disease free survival; epidemiology; middle aged; mortality; Adolescent; Adult; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Vietnam","","","Funding text 1: Funding:ThisstudywassupportedbytheJapan SocietyforthePromotionofScience(JSPS)grant KAKENHI26293115.Thefunderhadnorolein studydesign,datacollectionandanalysis,decision topublish,orpreparationofthemanuscript.; Funding text 2: This study was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) grant KAKENHI26293115.

In the present study, we used an improved Cre (iCre) gene to enhance the efficiency of Cre expression in mammalian cells. We established a new transgenic Krt19-iCre bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mouse model using the BAC recombineering strategy. Site-specific iCre expression pattern was examined in embryos, adults, and elderly Krt19-iCre mice crossed with Tomato or LacZ reporter mice. Both iCre and reporter protein expressions in adult Krt19-iCre;Toma-toflox/+ (Krt19-iCre Tomato reporter) mice were observed mainly in the epithelial cells of the GI tract, hepatobiliary tissues, and pancreas. However, the expression in the intrahepatic and small pancreatic duct were lower than those in the common bile and large pancreatic duct. In the Krt19-iCre; LacZ reporter embryos, β-galactosidase for the LacZ reporter was expressed in the glandular epithelial cells of the GI tract in 9.5-day embryos, 12-day embryos, and newborn mice.

Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables—in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition—are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers—which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)—are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rain; Biodiversity; Biogeography; Concentration (parameter); Decomposition; Ectomycorrhiza; Forest; Latitude; Letter; Nitrogen Availability; Nitrogen Fixation; Nonhuman; Photosynthesis; Plant Root; Positive Feedback; Precipitation; Prediction; Priority Journal; Seasonal Variation; Soil Acidity; Symbiosis; Temperature Measurement; Climate; Geographic Mapping; Metabolism; Microbiology; Mycorrhiza; Physiology; Season; Tree; Fungi; Climate; Forests; Geographic Mapping; Mycorrhizae; Nitrogen Fixation; Rain; Seasons; Symbiosis; Trees","nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; biodiversity; biogeography; concentration (parameter); decomposition; ectomycorrhiza; forest; latitude; Letter; nitrogen availability; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant root; positive feedback; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil acidity; symbiosis; temperature measurement; climate; geographic mapping; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; season; tree; Fungi; Climate; Forests; Geographic Mapping; Mycorrhizae; Nitrogen Fixation; Rain; Seasons; Symbiosis; Trees","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0","","Batterman, Sarah A., Key role of symbiotic dinitrogen fixation in tropical forest secondary succession, Nature, 502, 7470, pp. 224-227, (2013); Shah, Firoz, Ectomycorrhizal fungi decompose soil organic matter using oxidative mechanisms adapted from saprotrophic ancestors, New Phytologist, 209, 4, pp. 1705-1719, (2016); Averill, Colin, Mycorrhiza-mediated competition between plants and decomposers drives soil carbon storage, Nature, 505, 7484, pp. 543-545, (2014); Clemmensen, Karina Engelbrecht, Roots and associated fungi drive long-term carbon sequestration in boreal forest, Science, 340, 6127, pp. 1615-1618, (2013); Cheeke, Tanya E., Dominant mycorrhizal association of trees alters carbon and nutrient cycling by selecting for microbial groups with distinct enzyme function, New Phytologist, 214, 1, pp. 432-442, (2017); Terrer, César, Mycorrhizal association as a primary control of the CO2 fertilization effect, Science, 353, 6294, pp. 72-74, (2016); Brundrett, Mark C., Evolutionary history of mycorrhizal symbioses and global host plant diversity, New Phytologist, 220, 4, pp. 1108-1115, (2018); Averill, Colin, Ectomycorrhizal fungi slow soil carbon cycling, Ecology Letters, 19, 8, pp. 937-947, (2016); Bennett, Jonathan A., Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics, Science, 355, 6321, (2017); Phillips, Richard P., The mycorrhizal-associated nutrient economy: A new framework for predicting carbon-nutrient couplings in temperate forests, New Phytologist, 199, 1, pp. 41-51, (2013)","","Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","14764687; 00280836","9780203448410; 0203448413","NATUA","31092941","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065790614"

This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity3–6. Here we use 2,009 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017—and more than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions—was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing—and in some countries reversal—of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Africa South Of The Sahara; Aged; Body Height; Body Mass; Body Weight; Controlled Study; Developed Country; Epidemic; Female; Health Care Access; High Income Country; Human; Letter; Low Income Country; Male; Middle Income Country; Nutrition Education; Obesity; Prevalence; Priority Journal; Rural Area; Urban Area; Adolescent; Age; Developing Country; Geographic Mapping; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Rural Health; Rural Population; Sex Factor; Urban Health; Urban Population; Very Elderly; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Body Mass Index; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diet, Healthy; Female; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Rural Health; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Urban Health; Urban Population; Young Adult","adult; Africa south of the Sahara; aged; body height; body mass; body weight; controlled study; developed country; epidemic; female; health care access; high income country; human; Letter; low income country; male; middle income country; nutrition education; obesity; prevalence; priority journal; rural area; urban area; adolescent; age; developing country; geographic mapping; middle aged; nutritional status; rural health; rural population; sex factor; urban health; urban population; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diet, Healthy; Female; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Rural Health; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Urban Health; Urban Population; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements This study was funded by the Wellcome Trust.

Doubly magic nuclei, with magic numbers for both protons and neutrons, are spherical and extremely rare across the nuclear landscape. Although the sequence of magic numbers is well established for stable nuclei, experimental evidence has revealed modifications for nuclei with a large asymmetry between proton and neutron numbers. Here we provide a spectroscopic study of the doubly magic nucleus 78 Ni, which contains fourteen neutrons more than the heaviest stable nickel isotope. We provide direct evidence of its doubly magic nature, which is also predicted by ab initio calculations based on chiral effective-field theory interactions and the quasi-particle random-phase approximation. Our results also indicate the breakdown of the neutron magic number 50 and proton magic number 28 beyond this stronghold, caused by a competing deformed structure. State-of-the-art phenomenological shell-model calculations reproduce this shape coexistence, predicting a rapid transition from spherical to deformed ground states, with 78 Ni as the turning point. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nickel; Proton; Isotope; Nickel; Nickel 78; Proton; Unclassified Drug; Asymmetry; Detection Method; Electron; Experimental Study; Isotopic Analysis; Spectroscopy; Article; Calculation; Chemical Structure; Neutron; Nuclear Deformation; Nuclear Energy And Related Phenomena; Prediction; Priority Journal; Theory","isotope; nickel; nickel 78; proton; unclassified drug; asymmetry; detection method; electron; experimental study; isotopic analysis; spectroscopy; Article; calculation; chemical structure; neutron; nuclear deformation; nuclear energy and related phenomena; prediction; priority journal; theory","","nickel, 7440-02-0; proton, 12408-02-5, 12586-59-3","Acknowledgements We thank the staff of the RIKEN Nishina Center accelerator complex for providing a stable and high-intensity uranium beam and the BigRIPS team for the smooth operation of the secondary beams.

Through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we compared the composition of microbiota in the saliva, vaginal mucus, and feces of pigs, and in swabs of feeder troughs and water dispensers collected from pig farms in Vietnam. The composition of the microbiota differed between samples in each sample group. Streptococcus, Actinobacillus, Moraxella, and Rothia were the most abundant genera and significantly discriminative in saliva samples, regardless of the plasticity and changeability of the composition of microbiota in saliva. Moreover, species assignment of the genus Streptococcus revealed that Streptococcus suis was exceptional in the salivary microbiota, due to being most abundant among the streptococcal species and sharing estimated proportions of 5.7%–9.4% of the total bacteria in saliva. Thus, pig oral microbiota showed unique characteristics in which the major species was the pig pathogen. On the other hand, β-diversity analysis showed that the microbiota in saliva was distinct from those in the others. From the above results, pig saliva was shown to be the major natural habitat of S. suis, and is suggested to be the most probable source of S. suis infection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Rna 16s; 16s Rrna Gene; Actinobacillus; Amplicon; Animal Tissue; Article; Bacterial Gene; Controlled Study; Dna Sequence; Feces Analysis; Gene Sequence; Microbial Diversity; Moraxella; Nonhuman; Oral Biopsy; Pig; Population Abundance; Rothia; Saliva Analysis; Sequence Analysis; Species Composition; Species Habitat; Streptococcus Infection; Streptococcus Suis; Vagina Smear; Viet Nam; Animal; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Feces; Female; Genetics; Microbiology; Microflora; Nucleotide Sequence; Phylogeny; Physiology; Saliva; Species Difference; Vagina; Animals; Base Sequence; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Feces; Female; Microbiota; Phylogeny; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Saliva; Species Specificity; Swine; Vagina","RNA 16S; 16S rRNA gene; Actinobacillus; amplicon; animal tissue; Article; bacterial gene; controlled study; DNA sequence; feces analysis; gene sequence; microbial diversity; Moraxella; nonhuman; oral biopsy; pig; population abundance; Rothia; saliva analysis; sequence analysis; species composition; species habitat; Streptococcus infection; Streptococcus suis; vagina smear; Viet Nam; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; feces; female; genetics; microbiology; microflora; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; saliva; species difference; vagina; Animals; Base Sequence; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Feces; Female; Microbiota; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Saliva; Species Specificity; Swine; Vagina","","RNA, Ribosomal, 16S","Funded by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) - 16K08015 [T.W].

Pop2 regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally by shortening the poly(A) tail of mRNA. A previous study has shown that Pop2 is phosphorylated at threonine 97 (T97) by Yak1 protein kinase in response to glucose limitation. However, the physiological importance of Pop2 phosphorylation remains unknown. In this study, we found that Pop2 is phosphorylated at serine 39 (S39) under unstressed conditions. The dephosphorylation of S39 was occurred rapidly after glucose depletion, and the addition of glucose to the glucose-deprived culture recovered this phosphorylation, suggesting that Pop2 phosphorylation at S39 is regulated by glucose. This glucose-regulated phosphorylation of Pop2 at S39 is dependent on Pho85 kinase. We previously reported that Pop2 takes a part in the cell wall integrity pathway by regulating LRG1 mRNA; however, S39 phosphorylation of Pop2 is not involved in LRG1 expression. On the other hand, Pop2 phosphorylation at S39 is involved in the expression of HSP12 and HSP26, which encode a small heat shock protein. In the medium supplemented with glucose, Pop2 might be phosphorylated at S39 by Pho85 kinase, and this phosphorylation contributes to repress the expression of HSP12 and HSP26. Glucose starvation inactivated Pho85, which resulted in the derepression of HSP12 and HSP26, together with other glucose sensing mechanisms. Our results suggest that Pho85-dependent phosphorylation of Pop2 is a part of the glucose sensing system in yeast. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exonuclease; Glucose; Serine; Ribonuclease; Glucose; Glycoproteins; Gtpase-activating Proteins; Heat-shock Proteins; Hsp12 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Hsp26 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Lrg1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Pir3 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Pop2 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Ribonucleases; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Proteins; Serine; Exonuclease; Glucose; Guanosine Triphosphatase Activating Protein; Heat Shock Protein 26; Lrg1 Protein; Messenger Rna; Pir3 Protein; Pop2 Protein; Repressor Protein; Serine; Unclassified Drug; Glycoprotein; Heat Shock Protein; Hsp12 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Hsp26 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Lrg1 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Pir3 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Pop2 Protein, S Cerevisiae; Ribonuclease; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Protein; Article; Cell Wall; Controlled Study; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Repression; Hsp12 Gene; Hsp26 Gene; Protein Dephosphorylation; Protein Phosphorylation; Catabolite Repression; Chemistry; Drug Effect; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Metabolism; Phosphorylation; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Catabolite Repression; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glucose; Glycoproteins; Gtpase-activating Proteins; Heat-shock Proteins; Phosphorylation; Ribonucleases; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Proteins; Serine","exonuclease; glucose; guanosine triphosphatase activating protein; heat shock protein 26; LRG1 protein; messenger RNA; PIR3 protein; Pop2 protein; repressor protein; serine; unclassified drug; glycoprotein; heat shock protein; HSP12 protein, S cerevisiae; HSP26 protein, S cerevisiae; LRG1 protein, S cerevisiae; Pir3 protein, S cerevisiae; POP2 protein, S cerevisiae; ribonuclease; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; Article; cell wall; controlled study; gene; gene expression; gene repression; HSP12 gene; HSP26 gene; protein dephosphorylation; protein phosphorylation; catabolite repression; chemistry; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; phosphorylation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Catabolite Repression; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glucose; Glycoproteins; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Heat-Shock Proteins; Phosphorylation; Ribonucleases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Serine","","exonuclease, 37228-74-3; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; serine, 56-45-1, 6898-95-9; ribonuclease, 59794-03-5, 9001-99-4; Glucose; Glycoproteins; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Heat-Shock Proteins; HSP12 protein, S cerevisiae; HSP26 protein, S cerevisiae; LRG1 protein, S cerevisiae; Pir3 protein, S cerevisiae; POP2 protein, S cerevisiae; Ribonucleases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Serine","","Parker, Roy R., RNA degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisae, Genetics, 191, 3, pp. 671-702, (2012); Collart, Martine A., Global control of gene expression in yeast by the Ccr4-Not complex, Gene, 313, 1-2, pp. 1-16, (2003); Sakai, Akira, Molecular analysis of POP2gene, a gene required for glucose-derepression of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nucleic Acids Research, 20, 23, pp. 6227-6233, (1992); Li, Xia, Different regulations of ROM2 and LRG1 expression by Ccr4, Pop2, and Dhh1 in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall integrity pathway, mSphere, 1, 5, (2016); Hata, Hiroaki, Dhh1p, a putative RNA helicase, associates with the general transcription factors Pop2p and Ccr4p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Genetics, 148, 2, pp. 571-579, (1998); Moriya, Hisao, Yak1p, a DYRK family kinase, translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates yeast Pop2p in response to a glucose signal, Genes and Development, 15, 10, pp. 1217-1228, (2001); Ueda, Yoshinami, Isolation and characterization of recessive, constitutive mutations for repressible acid phosphatase synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Journal of Bacteriology, 122, 3, pp. 911-922, (1975); Kaffman, Arie, Phosphorylation of the transcription factor PHO4 by a cyclin-CDK complex, PHO80-PHO85, Science, 263, 5150, pp. 1153-1156, (1994); Measday, Vivien, A family of cyclin-like proteins that interact with the Pho85 cyclin- dependent kinase, Molecular and Cellular Biology, 17, 3, pp. 1212-1223, (1997); Carroll, Adam S., Pho85 and signaling environmental conditions, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 27, 2, pp. 87-93, (2002)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","30973945","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064406079"

In Arabidopsis, the AP2 family transcription factor PUCHI controls cell proliferation in lateral root primordia. To identify potential targets of PUCHI, we analyzed a time course transcriptomic dataset of lateral root formation. We report that multiple genes coding for very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthesis enzymes are induced during lateral root development in a PUCHI-dependent manner. Significantly, several mutants perturbed in VLCFA biosynthesis show similar lateral root developmental defects as puchi-1. Moreover, puchi-1 roots display the same disorganized callus formation phenotype as VLCFA biosynthesis-deficient mutants when grown on auxin-rich callus-inducing medium. Lipidomic profiling of puchi-1 roots revealed reduced VLCFA content compared with WT. We conclude that PUCHI-regulated VLCFA biosynthesis is part of a pathway controlling cell proliferation during lateral root and callus formation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Callus Formation; Cell Division; Lateral Root Formation; Morphogenesis; Vlcfa; Arabidopsis Proteins; Fatty Acids; Indoleacetic Acids; Puchi Protein, Arabidopsis; Transcription Factors; Very Long Chain Fatty Acid; Arabidopsis Protein; Fatty Acid; Indoleacetic Acid Derivative; Puchi Protein, Arabidopsis; Transcription Factor; Arabidopsis; Article; Callus (plant); Cell Proliferation; Controlled Study; Enzyme Synthesis; Fatty Acid Synthesis; Gene; Gene Function; Gene Identification; Genetic Code; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Plant Development; Plant Root; Priority Journal; Promoter Region; Puchi Gene; Root Development; Transcriptomics; Biosynthesis; Callus; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Arabidopsis Proteins; Bony Callus; Cell Proliferation; Fatty Acids; Indoleacetic Acids; Plant Development; Plant Roots; Transcription Factors","very long chain fatty acid; Arabidopsis protein; fatty acid; indoleacetic acid derivative; Puchi protein, Arabidopsis; transcription factor; Arabidopsis; Article; callus (plant); cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme synthesis; fatty acid synthesis; gene; gene function; gene identification; genetic code; nonhuman; phenotype; plant development; plant root; priority journal; promoter region; PUCHI gene; root development; transcriptomics; biosynthesis; callus; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Arabidopsis Proteins; Bony Callus; Cell Proliferation; Fatty Acids; Indoleacetic Acids; Plant Development; Plant Roots; Transcription Factors","","Arabidopsis Proteins; Fatty Acids; Indoleacetic Acids; Puchi protein, Arabidopsis; Transcription Factors","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

Characterization of fly ashes can be helpful to evaluate their use potentials. This study aimed to investigate the physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of fly ashes from five thermal power stations in Northern Vietnam in relation to use as sandy soil amendments. The results showed that the fly ashes were dominated by silt-sized and spherical particles and had low bulk densities. There was almost not significant difference in the surface charges among the fly ashes; however, their surface areas varied widely. The fly ashes were alkaline. The electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity in the fly ashes were higher than those in the sandy soil. The concentrations of extractable K, P, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the fly ashes were higher compared with the sandy soil. The major matrix elements in the fly ashes were Si, Al, and Fe together with significant percentages of K, Mg, Ca and Ti. Quartz was the most predominant mineral present in the fly ashes. Several radioactive elements were found in the fly ashes with very low concentrations. The potential to release trace elements from the fly ashes was below the regulatory guidelines. The amendment of fly ashes to the sandy soil led to the substantial decrease in the hydraulic conductivity but the increase in the plant-available water contents of the sandy soil. It is recommended to use the fly ashes as soil amendments for sandy soil amelioration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fly Ash; Sandy Soil; Soil Amelioration; Soil Amendment; Thermal Power Station; Concentration (composition); Electrical Conductivity; Fly Ash; Ion Exchange; Power Plant; Sandy Soil; Soil Amendment; Thermal Power; Viet Nam","concentration (composition); electrical conductivity; fly ash; ion exchange; power plant; sandy soil; soil amendment; thermal power; Viet Nam","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number: 105.08-2014.31.","Adriano, Domy C., UTILIZATION AND DISPOSAL OF FLY ASH AND OTHER COAL RESIDUES IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS: A REVIEW., Journal of Environmental Quality, 9, 3, pp. 333-344, (1980); Ahmaruzzaman, Mohammed, A review on the utilization of fly ash, Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 36, 3, pp. 327-363, (2010); Aitken, R.

However, the ability of the mammalian brain to regenerate neuronal circuits for functional recovery is quite limited. Here, using a mouse model for ischemic stroke, we show that neuroblast migration is restricted by reactive astrocytes in and around the lesion. To migrate, the neuroblasts use Slit1-Robo2 signaling to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton in reactive astrocytes at the site of contact. Slit1-overexpressing neuroblasts transplanted into the poststroke brain migrated closer to the lesion than did control neuroblasts. These neuroblasts matured into striatal neurons and efficiently regenerated neuronal circuits, resulting in functional recovery in the poststroke mice. These results suggest that the positioning of new neurons will be critical for functional neuronal regeneration in stem/progenitor cell–based therapies for brain injury. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cdc42 Gtp-binding Protein; Intercellular Signaling Peptides And Proteins; Receptors, Immunologic; Brain; Mammals; Proteins; Stem Cells; Actin Cytoskeleton; Functional Recovery; Functional Regeneration; Ischemic Strokes; Neural Stem Cell; Neuronal Circuits; Neuronal Regenerations; Striatal Neurons; Neurons; Immunoglobulin Receptor; Protein Binding; Protein Cdc42; Signal Peptide; Actin Filament; Animal; Astrocyte; Brain; Cell Motion; Chemistry; Genetics; Glia; Knockout Mouse; Male; Metabolism; Mouse; Nerve Cell; Nervous System Development; Protein Multimerization; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Actin Cytoskeleton; Animals; Astrocytes; Cdc42 Gtp-binding Protein; Cell Movement; Intercellular Signaling Peptides And Proteins; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neurogenesis; Neuroglia; Protein Binding; Protein Multimerization; Receptors, Immunologic; Regeneration; Signal Transduction","Brain; Mammals; Proteins; Stem cells; Actin cytoskeleton; Functional recovery; Functional regeneration; Ischemic strokes; Neural stem cell; Neuronal circuits; Neuronal regenerations; Striatal neurons; Neurons; immunoglobulin receptor; protein binding; protein Cdc42; signal peptide; actin filament; animal; astrocyte; brain; cell motion; chemistry; genetics; glia; knockout mouse; male; metabolism; mouse; nerve cell; nervous system development; protein multimerization; regeneration; signal transduction; Actin Cytoskeleton; Animals; Astrocytes; cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein; Cell Movement; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neurogenesis; Neuroglia; Protein Binding; Protein Multimerization; Receptors, Immunologic; Regeneration; Signal Transduction","","cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Receptors, Immunologic","","Ihrie, Rebecca A., Lake-Front Property: A Unique Germinal Niche by the Lateral Ventricles of the Adult Brain, Neuron, 70, 4, pp. 674-686, (2011); Kaneko, Naoko, Mechanisms of neuronal migration in the adult brain, Journal of Neurochemistry, 141, 6, pp. 835-847, (2017); Lim, Daniel A., The adult ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis, Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, 8, 5, (2016); Arvidsson, Andreas, Neuronal replacement from endogenous precursors in the adult brain after stroke, Nature Medicine, 8, 9, pp. 963-970, (2002); Parent, Jack M., Rat forebrain neurogenesis and striatal neuron replacement after focal stroke, Annals of Neurology, 52, 6, pp. 802-813, (2002); Yamashita, Tohru, Subventricular zone-derived neuroblasts migrate and differentiate into mature neurons in the post-stroke adult striatum, Journal of Neuroscience, 26, 24, pp. 6627-6636, (2006); Khakh, Baljit Singh, Diversity of astrocyte functions and phenotypes in neural circuits, Nature Neuroscience, 18, 7, pp. 942-952, (2015); Sofronïew, Michael V., Astrogliosis, Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, 7, 2, (2015); Li, Yi, The role of astrocytes in mediating exogenous cell-based restorative therapy for stroke, GLIA, 62, 1, pp. 1-16, (2014); Gengatharan, Archana, The role of astrocytes in the generation, migration, and integration of new neurons in the adult olfactory bulb, Frontiers in Neuroscience, 10, APR, (2016)","","American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","","","23752548","","","30547091","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058754235"

Administration of a single dose (50 mg/kg) of thioacetamide (TAA) in Cygb-TG mice resulted in lower levels of alanine transaminase and oxidative stress than those in WT mice. After 10 weeks of TAA administration, Cygb-TG livers exhibited reduced neutrophil accumulation, cytokine expression and fibrosis but high levels of quiescent HSCs. Primary HSCs isolated from Cygb-TG mice (HSCCygb-TG) exhibited significantly decreased mRNA levels of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), collagen 1α1, and transforming growth factor β-3 after 4 days in culture relative to WT cells. HSCsCygb-TG were resistant to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced αSMA expression. Thus, cell-specific overexpression of Cygb attenuates HSC activation and protects mice against TAA-induced liver fibrosis presumably by maintaining HSC quiescence. Cygb is a potential new target for antifibrotic approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Red Fluorescent Protein; Thioacetamide; Cytoglobin; Luminescent Proteins; Red Fluorescent Protein; Thioacetamide; Cytoglobin; Photoprotein; Red Fluorescent Protein; Thioacetamide; Animal; Biosynthesis; Enzymology; Gene Expression; Gene Fusion; Genetics; Hepatic Stellate Cell; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Metabolism; Mouse; Pathology; Promoter Region; Reporter Gene; Transgenic Mouse; Animals; Artificial Gene Fusion; Cytoglobin; Gene Expression; Genes, Reporter; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Luminescent Proteins; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Thioacetamide","cytoglobin; photoprotein; red fluorescent protein; thioacetamide; animal; biosynthesis; enzymology; gene expression; gene fusion; genetics; hepatic stellate cell; liver; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; mouse; pathology; promoter region; reporter gene; transgenic mouse; Animals; Artificial Gene Fusion; Cytoglobin; Gene Expression; Genes, Reporter; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Luminescent Proteins; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Thioacetamide","","red fluorescent protein, 251925-26-5; thioacetamide, 62-55-5; Cytoglobin; Luminescent Proteins; red fluorescent protein; Thioacetamide","We thank Drs.

We found that soil-N, -C, -Al, -K and -Ca contents significantly differed due to the fallow durations/types. Subsequently, the effects of fallow types and soil depths on the diversity, species richness and community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi were examined. A higher AM species richness was identified in the cropping than in forest fallow fields, suggesting a positive cropping feedback on the AM community composition. Distribution of the AM species was positively related to soil properties, specifically soil-pH, and soil-Pi, -Ca and -Mg contents. The soil properties conjointly accounted for 78.5% of explained variation in the AM community composition, signifying that the main factors altering the community structure under different fallow and cropping systems were the soil properties. Among the soil chemical characteristics, the soil-pH disclosed a significant explained variation in the AM community composition in the topsoil layer under the short fallow. Structural modeling equation to understand multiple predictive pathways that connect soil properties, fallow practices and AM community structures indicated that soil-C, -N and -Ca contents were highlighted as important factors influencing the AM community compositions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Soil; Agriculture; Chemistry; Classification; Forest; Microbiology; Mycobiome; Mycorrhiza; Physiology; Plant Root; Procedures; Season; Soil; Agriculture; Forests; Mycobiome; Mycorrhizae; Plant Roots; Seasons; Soil","agriculture; chemistry; classification; forest; microbiology; mycobiome; mycorrhiza; physiology; plant root; procedures; season; soil; Agriculture; Forests; Mycobiome; Mycorrhizae; Plant Roots; Seasons; Soil","","Soil","The Network for International Development and Cooperation (NIDECO) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich are appreciated for jointly funding this project.

It is systematically found that the encapsulation of methanol enhances the mechanical stability of MOF-901 as the elastic tensors C<inf>ij</inf> of MOF-901∙nMeOH are higher than the corresponding C<inf>ij</inf> quantities reported for solvent-free MOF-901. Moreover, the 2D characteristics of MOF-901 is confirmed by verifying the negative values of C<inf>33</inf>. At the same time, the band gap of MOF-901 is observed to be solvent-dependent. In its pure form, MOF-901 possesses a direct gap (E<inf>g</inf>) of 2.07 eV, with the valence and conduction bands mainly constituted by electrons of 4-aminobenzoate linkers. Introducing methanol into MOF-901 causes distortion to the 4-aminobenzoate geometry, thereby induces electronic degeneracy to the conduction bands. Consequently, E<inf>g</inf> is narrowed to 1.84 eV with 5.7 wt% MeOH or 1.63 eV with 11.4 wt% MeOH. Hence, it is possible to tailor the band gap of MOF-901 by controlling methanol guest, which only acquires van der Waals interaction to the framework. In addition, our theoretical prediction shows a Ti(IV) site can undergo electronic hopping to become Ti(III) under the effect of visible light (~440–443 nm). Then, Ti(III) is capable of breaking the C-Br bond in ethyl α-bromophenylacetate spontaneously, which in turn activates the polymerization of methyl methacrylate with an energy barrier of 0.30 eV. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We are grateful for computational support from the High-Performance Computing Laboratory, Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Technology, Vietnam National University and the Institute for Material Research, Tohoku University.

In this processing, the clays are used as a source for aluminum and silicon, and it is important to get a well-mixed homogenous solution by the aid of some heat and pressure. The present method proposes the use of ethylene glycol as a solvent, rather than water. It has been found that one can obtain crystalline pollucite by heating up to 350 °C in a high-pressure container (~15 MPa), mixed with montmorillonite – an abundant natural clay and ethylene glycol. It has been found that the reduction of the amount of water helps to achieve very high confinement rate in a reasonable time of few~20 h. This will be fairly important in processing contaminated water in the nuclear power plant. The influence of seawater has been also examined. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","of the authors (N.D.Q.) wishes to thank the Nuclear Researcher Exchange Program of the Japanese government for financial support.

However, there may be additional, currently unknown, human adaptation polymerase mutations. Here, we used a database search of influenza virus H5N1 clade 1.1, clade 2.3.2.1 and clade 2.3.4 strains isolated from 2008–2012 in Southern China, Vietnam and Cambodia to identify polymerase adaptation mutations that had been selected in infected patients. Several of these mutations acted either alone or together to increase viral polymerase activity in human airway cells to levels similar to the PB2-D701N and PB2-E627K single mutations and to increase progeny virus yields in infected mouse lungs to levels similar to the PB2-D701N single mutation. In particular, specific mutations acted synergistically with the PB2-D701N mutation and showed synergistic effects on viral replication both in human airway cells and mice compared with the corresponding single mutations.

Floods in urban areas cause significant damage to infrastructure, communities and the environment. Numerical modelling of flood inundation offers detailed information necessary for managing flood risk in such contexts. This study presents a calibrated flood inundation model using referenced photos, an assessment of the influence of four extreme rainfall events on water depth and inundation area in the Hanoi central area. Four types of historical and extreme rainfall were input into the inundation model. The modeled results for a 2008 flood event with 9 referenced stations resulted in an R2 of 0.6 compared to observations. The water depth at the different locations was simulated under the four extreme rainfall types. The flood inundation under the Probable Maximum Precipitation presents the highest risk in terms of water depth and inundation area. These results provide insights into managing flood risk, designing flood prevention measures, and appropriately locating pump stations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Financial support came from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (300102298302), One Hundred Talent Plan of Shaanxi Province, and National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant Number 41302207, Sophia University Research Branding Project (adopted in 2016): Transdisciplinary and Trans-national Research Program for Achieving Regional Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through River Basin Environment Conservation and Management.

We used the chicken egg CAM assay to evaluate efficacy of anticancer drug delivery using recently developed biodegradable PMO (periodic mesoporous organosilica) nanoparticles. Human ovarian cancer cells were transplanted onto the CAM membrane of fertilized eggs, resulting in rapid tumor formation. The tumor closely resembles cancer patient tumor and contains extracellular matrix as well as stromal cells and extensive vasculature. PMO nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin were injected intravenously into the chicken egg resulting in elimination of the tumor. No significant damage to various organs in the chicken embryo occurred. In contrast, injection of free doxorubicin caused widespread organ damage, even when less amount was administered. The lack of toxic effect of nanoparticle loaded doxorubicin was associated with specific delivery of doxorubicin to the tumor. Furthermore, we observed excellent tumor accumulation of the nanoparticles. Lastly, a tumor could be established in the egg using tumor samples from ovarian cancer patients and that our nanoparticles were effective in eliminating the tumor. These results point to the remarkable efficacy of our nanoparticle based drug delivery system and suggests the value of the chicken egg tumor model for testing novel therapies for ovarian cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Doxorubicin; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Doxorubicin; Drug Carrier; Nanoparticle; Animal; Bioassay; Biological Model; Chemistry; Chick Embryo; Chorioallantois; Female; Human; Metabolism; Ovary Tumor; Pathology; Tumor Cell Line; Animals; Biological Assay; Cell Line, Tumor; Chick Embryo; Chorioallantoic Membrane; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Female; Humans; Models, Biological; Nanoparticles; Ovarian Neoplasms","doxorubicin; drug carrier; nanoparticle; animal; bioassay; biological model; chemistry; chick embryo; chorioallantois; female; human; metabolism; ovary tumor; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Biological Assay; Cell Line, Tumor; Chick Embryo; Chorioallantoic Membrane; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Female; Humans; Models, Biological; Nanoparticles; Ovarian Neoplasms","","doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers","This work was supported by a grant from JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP15K21764 (to FT) and City of Hope Women’s Cancer Award P30-CA33572 (to CAG).

In the present study, an amplicon mixture of nine representative genes causing resistance to anti-malaria drugs is diagnosed. First, we developed the procedure for four laboratory strains (3D7, Dd2, 7G8, and K1), and then applied the developed procedure to ten clinical samples. We sequenced and re-sequenced the samples using the obsolete flow cell R7.3 and the most recent flow cell R9.4. Although the average base-call accuracy of the MinION sequencer was 74.3%, performing >50 reads at a given position improves the accuracy of the SNP call, yielding a precision and recall rate of 0.92 and 0.8, respectively, with flow cell R7.3. These numbers increased significantly with flow cell R9.4, in which the precision and recall are 1 and 0.97, respectively. Based on the SNP information, the drug resistance status in ten clinical samples was inferred. We also analyzed K13 gene mutations from 54 additional clinical samples as a proof of concept. We found that a novel amino-acid changing variation is dominant in this area. In addition, we performed a small population-based analysis using 3 and 5 cases (K13) and 10 and 5 cases (PfCRT) from Thailand and Vietnam, respectively. We identified distinct genotypes from the respective regions.

Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is also known to be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. We herein modeled the study of UCHL1 in Drosophila melanogaster and investigated its functions in PD. The specific knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog of UCHL1 (dUCH) in dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) led to the underdevelopment and/or degeneration of these neurons, specifically in DL1 DA neuron cluster in the larval brain lobe and PPM2, PPM3, PPL2ab, and VUM DA neuron clusters in the adult brain. These defects were followed by a shortage of dopamine in the brain, which subsequently resulted in locomotor dysfunction. The degeneration of DA neurons in dUCH knockdown adult brain, which occurred progressively and severely during the course of aging, mimics the epidemiology of PD. DA neuron and locomotor defects were rescued when dUCH knockdown flies were treated with vitamin C, a well-known antioxidant. These results suggest that dUCH knockdown fly is a promising model for studying the pathogenesis and epidemiology of PD as well as the screening of potential antioxidants for PD therapeutics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ascorbic Acid; Dopamine; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Dopamine; Drosophila Proteins; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Uch Protein, Drosophila; Antioxidant; Ascorbic Acid; Dopamine; Drosophila Protein; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Uch Protein, Drosophila; Animal; Disease Model; Dopaminergic Nerve Cell; Drosophila Melanogaster; Drug Effect; Gene Knockdown; Genetics; Human; Male; Metabolism; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Pathology; Animals; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine; Dopaminergic Neurons; Drosophila Proteins; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Male; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","antioxidant; ascorbic acid; dopamine; Drosophila protein; ubiquitin thiolesterase; UCH protein, Drosophila; animal; disease model; dopaminergic nerve cell; Drosophila melanogaster; drug effect; gene knockdown; genetics; human; male; metabolism; oxidative stress; Parkinson disease; pathology; Animals; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine; Dopaminergic Neurons; Drosophila Proteins; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Male; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","","ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; ubiquitin thiolesterase, 86480-67-3; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Dopamine; Drosophila Proteins; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; UCH protein, Drosophila","We thank all members of the Fly Biomedical Research Group for fly food, their technical support, and helpful discussions.

Here, we clarify the expression and timing of the plasticity in nodal root elongation through the hardpan under SMF and its contribution to shoot growth using a shallow-rooting IR64 and its deep-rooting introgression line, YTH304. Under SMF, soil moisture content had negative relationship with soil penetration resistance, regardless of hardpan bulk densities. YTH304 had greater root system below the hardpan than IR64 in hardpan with 1.50 but not in 1.70 g cm-3 bulk density (BD). YTH304 had greater plasticity in nodal root elongation through the hardpan than IR64 under SMF, which was clearly expressed during rewatering. YTH304 also had greater soil water uptake below the hardpan during drought and greater shoot growth than IR64. The results imply that deep root system development during SMF was due to the plasticity in nodal root elongation through the hardpan expressed during rewatering rather than during drought periods. This is against the long standing belief that active root elongation through the hardpan happens during drought. This also implies a need to revisit current root screening methods to identify rice lines with good hardpan penetration ability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Water; Clay; Water; Water; Adaptation; Clay; Drought; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Nodulation; Oryza; Physiological Stress; Plant Development; Adaptation, Physiological; Clay; Droughts; Plant Development; Root Nodules, Plant; Stress, Physiological; Water","water; adaptation; clay; drought; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nodulation; Oryza; physiological stress; plant development; Adaptation, Physiological; Clay; Droughts; Plant Development; Root Nodules, Plant; Stress, Physiological; Water","","water, 7732-18-5; Clay; Water","This research was funded by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 15H02644) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and partially supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS).","Henry, Amelia, Variation in root system architecture and drought response in rice (Oryza sativa): Phenotyping of the OryzaSNP panel in rainfed lowland fields, Field Crops Research, 120, 2, pp. 205-214, (2011); Nishiuchi, Shunsaku, Mechanisms for coping with submergence andwaterlogging in rice, Rice, 5, 1, pp. 1-14, (2012); Suralta, Roel Rodriguez, Dry matter production in relation to root plastic development, oxygen transport, and water uptake of rice under transient soil moisture stresses, Plant and Soil, 332, 1, pp. 87-104, (2010); Niones, Jonathan Manito, Field evaluation on functional roles of root plastic responses on dry matter production and grain yield of rice under cycles of transient soil moisture stresses using chromosome segment substitution lines, Plant and Soil, 359, 1-2, pp. 107-120, (2012); Boling, Anita A., Yield constraints of rainfed lowland rice in Central Java, Indonesia, Field Crops Research, 90, 2-3, pp. 351-360, (2004); Boling, Anita A., Modelling the effect of groundwater depth on yield-increasing interventions in rainfed lowland rice in Central Java, Indonesia, Agricultural Systems, 92, 1-3, pp. 115-139, (2007); McDonald, Andrew James, Water balance and rice growth responses to direct seeding, deep tillage, and landscape placement: Findings from a valley terrace in Nepal, Field Crops Research, 95, 2-3, pp. 367-382, (2006); Agric Sci, (2013); O'Toole, John C., Genotypic variation in crop plant root systems, Advances in Agronomy, 41, C, pp. 91-145, (1987); Sandhu, Nitika, Rice root architectural plasticity traits and genetic regions for adaptability to variable cultivation and stress conditions, Plant Physiology, 171, 4, pp. 2562-2576, (2016)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","29531273","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044142134"

To examine the basis of these differences, global gene expression in mature leaf tissue for all five trisomies and in diploids, triploids, and tetraploids of Arabidopsis thaliana was studied. The trisomies displayed a greater spread of expression modulation than the ploidy series. In general, expression of genes on the varied chromosome ranged from compensation to dosage effect, whereas genes from the remainder of the genome ranged from no effect to reduced expression approaching the inverse level of chromosomal imbalance (2/3). Genome-wide DNA methylation was examined in each genotype and found to shift most prominently with trisomy 4 but otherwise exhibited little change, indicating that genetic imbalance is generally mechanistically unrelated to DNA methylation. Independent analysis of gene functional classes demonstrated that ribosomal, proteasomal, and gene body methylated genes were less modulated compared with all classes of genes, whereas transcription factors, signal transduction components, and organelle-targeted protein genes were more tightly inversely affected. Comparing transcription factors and their targets in the trisomies and in expression networks revealed considerable discordance, illustrating that altered regulatory stoichiometry is a major contributor to genetic imbalance. Reanalysis of published data on gene expression in disomic yeast and trisomic mouse cells detected similar stoichiometric effects across broad phylogenetic taxa, and indicated that these effects reflect normal gene regulatory processes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aneuploidy; Dosage Compensation; Gene Balance Hypothesis; Polyploidy; Trisomy; Plant Dna; Transcription Factor; Aneuploidy; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Article; Dna Methylation; Gene Expression; Genomics; Nonhuman; Plant Chromosome; Plant Gene; Priority Journal; Trisomy; Animal; Arabidopsis; Chromosome; Drosophila; Genetics; Mouse; Polyploidy; Yeast; Aneuploidy; Animals; Chromosomes; Chromosomes, Plant; Dna Methylation; Gene Expression; Mice; Polyploidy; Trisomy; Yeasts","plant DNA; transcription factor; aneuploidy; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; DNA methylation; gene expression; genomics; nonhuman; plant chromosome; plant gene; priority journal; trisomy; animal; Arabidopsis; chromosome; Drosophila; genetics; mouse; polyploidy; yeast; Aneuploidy; Animals; Chromosomes; Chromosomes, Plant; DNA Methylation; Gene Expression; Mice; Polyploidy; Trisomy; Yeasts","","","","Blakeslee, Albert Francis, Chromosomal duplication and mendelian phenomena in Datura mutants, Science, 52, 1347, pp. 388-390, (1920); Blakeslee, Albert Francis, New jimson weeds from old chromosomes, Journal of Heredity, 25, 3, pp. 81-108, (1934); Am Nat, (1925); Genetics, (1979); Genetics, (1981); Guo, Mei, Trans-acting dosage effects on the expression of model gene systems in maize aneuploids, Science, 266, 5193, pp. 1999-2002, (1994); Sun, Lin, Dosage compensation and inverse effects in triple X metafemales of Drosophila, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 18, pp. 7383-7388, (2013); Sun, Lin, Differential effect of aneuploidy on the X chromosome and genes with sex-biased expression in Drosophila, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 41, pp. 16514-16519, (2013); Sheltzer, Jason M., Transcriptional consequences of aneuploidy, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 109, 31, pp. 12644-12649, (2012); Dürrbaum, Milena, Effects of aneuploidy on gene expression: Implications for cancer, FEBS Journal, 283, 5, pp. 791-802, (2016)","","National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","30429332","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057226717"

Some bacteria produce enzymes to inactivate the AHL signals of pathogenic bacteria via a phenomenon known as quorum quenching. One hundred bacterial isolates from potato tubers were screened for AHL-degrading activity using biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. Of these isolates, 20 were able to inactivate AHLs from the pathogenic bacteria in vitro. Of the 20 isolates, 6 attenuated tissue maceration of potato tubers by Pc. Suppression of tuber soft rot was observed even when these isolates were applied 24 h after the pathogen was introduced. Their colonization in tubers was approximately 103-104 cfu/g tuber, 7 days after inoculation. These isolates were identified as Bacillus sp., Variovorax sp., Variovorax paradoxus and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Four of these isolates showed putative AHL-lactonase activity and provided the most significant protection against Pc. Therefore, AHL-degrading endophytic bacteria can be utilized as a novel biocontrol agent of potato tuber soft rot in Vietnam. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ahl; Pectobacterium Carotovorum; Potato Tuber Soft Rot; Quorum Quenching; Quorum Sensing","","","","Funding text 1: This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 106.03-2012.61.

However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a win–win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agroecology; Biodiversity; Biological Control; Ecosystem Services; Natural Enemies; Agricultural Worker; Article; Biodiversity; Biology; Crop Pest; Habitat; Human; Landscape; Natural Enemy; Nonhuman; Predator; Prediction; Animal; Biological Model; Biological Pest Control; Crop; Ecosystem; Growth, Development And Aging; Parasitology; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Pest Control, Biological","agricultural worker; article; biodiversity; biology; crop pest; habitat; human; landscape; natural enemy; nonhuman; predator; prediction; animal; biological model; biological pest control; crop; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; parasitology; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Pest Control, Biological","","","Funding text 1: We thank the many growers, field assistants, pest-control advisors, funders, agricultural experiment stations, and researchers who provided access to study sites, technical expertise, labor, and other types of investment underlying the studies in our database.

Ostruthin increased whole-cell TREK-1 channel currents in 293T cells at a low concentration (EC<inf>50</inf> = 5.3 μM), and also activity of the TREK-2 channel (EC<inf>50</inf> = 3.7 mM). In contrast, ostruthin inhibited other K+ channels, e.g. human ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG1), inward-rectifier (Kir2.1), voltage-gated (Kv1.4), and two-pore domain (TASK-1) at higher concentrations, without affecting voltage-gated potassium channel (KCNQ1 and 3). We tested the effect of this compound on mouse anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and found anxiolytic activity in the open-field, elevated plus maze, and light/dark box tests. Of note, ostruthin also showed antidepressive effects in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, although previous studies reported that inhibition of TREK-1 channels resulted in an antidepressive effect. The anxiolytic and antidepressive effect was diminished by co-administration of a TREK-1 blocker, amlodipine, indicating the involvement of TREK-1 channels. Administration of ostruthin suppressed the stress-induced increase in anti-c-Fos immunoreactivity in the lateral septum, without affecting immunoreactivity in other mood disorder-related nuclei, e.g. the amygdala, paraventricular nuclei, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Ostruthin may exert its anxiolytic and antidepressive effects through a different mechanism from current drugs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amlodipine; Amlodipine; Anti-anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Ether-a-go-go Potassium Channels; Kcna4 Protein, Human; Kcnh1 Protein, Human; Kcnj2 Protein, Human; Kcnk10 Protein, Human; Kv1.4 Potassium Channel; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurotransmitter Agents; Ostruthin; Phytochemicals; Potassium Channel Protein Trek-1; Potassium Channel Subfamily K Member 3; Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain; Umbelliferones; Amlodipine; Antidepressant Agent; Anxiolytic Agent; Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channel Subunit Kir2.1; Ostruthin; Potassium Channel Herg; Potassium Channel Kcnq1; Potassium Channel Kcnq3; Potassium Channel Kv1.4; Protein C Fos; Unclassified Drug; Agents Interacting With Transmitter, Hormone Or Drug Receptors; Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channel; Kcna4 Protein, Human; Kcnh1 Protein, Human; Kcnj2 Protein, Human; Kcnk10 Protein, Human; Nerve Protein; Phytochemical; Potassium Channel Protein Trek-1; Potassium Channel Subfamily K Member 3; Tandem Pore Domain Potassium Channel; Umbelliferone Derivative; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Anxiety Disorder; Article; Concentration Response; Controlled Study; Depression; Drug Megadose; Elevated Plus Maze Test; Forced Swim Test; Human; Human Cell; Immunoreactivity; Light Dark Cycle; Low Drug Dose; Male; Medicinal Plant; Mouse; Nonhuman; Open Field Test; Paramignya Trimera; Patch Clamp Technique; Potassium Current; Tail Suspension Test; Agonists; Animal; Antagonists And Inhibitors; Anxiety; Brain; Dose Response; Drug Effect; Hek293 Cell Line; Institute For Cancer Research Mouse; Metabolism; Preclinical Study; Amlodipine; Animals; Anti-anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Anxiety; Brain; Depression; Dose-response Relationship, Drug; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Ether-a-go-go Potassium Channels; Hek293 Cells; Humans; Kv1.4 Potassium Channel; Male; Mice, Inbred Icr; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurotransmitter Agents; Phytochemicals; Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain; Umbelliferones","amlodipine; antidepressant agent; anxiolytic agent; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir2.1; ostruthin; potassium channel HERG; potassium channel KCNQ1; potassium channel KCNQ3; potassium channel Kv1.4; protein c fos; unclassified drug; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; inwardly rectifying potassium channel; KCNA4 protein, human; KCNH1 protein, human; KCNJ2 protein, human; KCNK10 protein, human; nerve protein; phytochemical; potassium channel protein TREK-1; potassium channel subfamily K member 3; tandem pore domain potassium channel; umbelliferone derivative; animal experiment; animal model; anxiety disorder; Article; concentration response; controlled study; depression; drug megadose; elevated plus maze test; forced swim test; human; human cell; immunoreactivity; light dark cycle; low drug dose; male; medicinal plant; mouse; nonhuman; open field test; Paramignya trimera; patch clamp technique; potassium current; tail suspension test; agonists; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; anxiety; brain; dose response; drug effect; HEK293 cell line; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; preclinical study; Amlodipine; Animals; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Anxiety; Brain; Depression; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Kv1.4 Potassium Channel; Male; Mice, Inbred ICR; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurotransmitter Agents; Phytochemicals; Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain; Umbelliferones","","amlodipine, 88150-42-9, 103129-82-4, 736178-83-9; Amlodipine; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels; KCNA4 protein, human; KCNH1 protein, human; KCNJ2 protein, human; KCNK10 protein, human; Kv1.4 Potassium Channel; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurotransmitter Agents; ostruthin; Phytochemicals; potassium channel protein TREK-1; potassium channel subfamily K member 3; Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain; Umbelliferones","This study was supported by KAKENHI (25460323 to MO) from the JSPS, the SICP from the JST, the Heiwa Nakajima Foundation, the Ryobi Memorial Foundation, Wesco Scientific Promotion Foundation (to MO), and the Fujii Memorial Foundation (to AJ).

Current evidence suggests that SEA was occupied by Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers until ~4000 years ago, when farming economies developed and expanded, restricting foraging groups to remote habitats. Some argue that agricultural development was indigenous; others favor the “two-layer” hypothesis that posits a southward expansion of farmers giving rise to present-day Southeast Asian genetic diversity. By sequencing 26 ancient human genomes (25 from SEA, 1 Japanese Jōmon), we show that neither interpretation fits the complexity of Southeast Asian history: Both Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers and East Asian farmers contributed to current Southeast Asian diversity, with further migrations affecting island SEA and Vietnam.

The static nonlinear elasticity of this framework under a uniaxial load is modelled with the two angular variables specifying the rotation and distortion of the linked square components. Numerically exploring the equilibrium paths then reveals a transition state of the structure at a critical value of the internal stiffness.

Authors are recommended to use flow diagrams to present the review process, allowing for better understanding among readers. However, no studies as of yet have assessed the quality of flow diagrams in systematic review/meta-analyses. Our study aims to evaluate the quality of systematic review/meta-analyses over a period of ten years, by assessing the quality of the flow diagrams, and the correlation to the methodological quality. Two hundred articles of “systematic review” and/or “meta-analysis” from January 2004 to August 2015 were randomly retrieved in Pubmed to be assessed for the flow diagram and methodological qualities. The flow diagrams were evaluated using a 16-grade scale corresponding to the four stages of PRISMA flow diagram. It composes four parts: Identification, Screening, Eligibility and Inclusion. Of the 200 articles screened, 154 articles were included and were assessed with AMSTAR checklist. Among them, 78 articles (50.6%) had the flow diagram. Over ten years, the proportion of papers with flow diagram available had been increasing significantly with regression coefficient beta = 5.649 (p = 0.002). However, the improvement in quality of the flow diagram increased slightly but not significantly (regression coefficient beta = 0.177, p = 0.133). Our analysis showed high variation in the proportion of articles that reported flow diagram components. The lowest proportions were 1% for reporting methods of duplicates removal in screening phase, followed by 6% for manual search in identification phase, 22% for number of studies for each specific/subgroup analysis, 27% for number of articles retrieved from each database, and 31% for number of studies included in © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Checklist; Controlled Study; Human; Human Experiment; Medical Research; Medline; Meta Analysis; Systematic Review; Literature; Measurement Accuracy; Meta Analysis (topic); Data Accuracy; Meta-analysis As Topic; Pubmed; Review Literature As Topic","article; checklist; controlled study; human; human experiment; medical research; Medline; meta analysis; systematic review; literature; measurement accuracy; meta analysis (topic); Data Accuracy; Meta-Analysis as Topic; PubMed; Review Literature as Topic","","","The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.

While it seems clear that the remote ancestors of Austronesian speakers originated in Southern China, and migrated to Taiwan with the development of rice farming by c. 5500 BP and onto the northern Philippines by c. 4000 BP (the Austronesian Dispersal Hypothesis or ADH), we know very little about the origins and emergence of Austronesian speakers in the Indonesian Archipelago. Using a combination of cranial morphometric and ancient mtDNA analyses on a new dataset from Gua Hairmau, that spans the pre-Neolithic through to Metal Period (5712—5591cal BP to 1864—1719 cal BP), we rigorously test the validity of the ADH in ISEA. A morphometric analysis of 23 adult male crania, using 16 of Martin’s standard measurements, was carried out with results compared to an East and Southeast Asian dataset of 30 sample populations spanning the Late Pleistocene through to Metal Period, in addition to 39 modern samples from East and Southeast Asia, near Oceania and Australia. Further, 20 samples were analyzed for ancient mtDNA and assigned to identified haplogroups. We demonstrate that the archaeological human remains from Gua Harimau cave, Sumatra, Indonesia provide clear evidence for at least two (cranio-morphometrically defined) and perhaps even three (in the context of the ancient mtDNA results) distinct populations from two separate time periods.

In this review, we aim to investigate the reporting practices and quality of both web- and non-web-based survey studies to enhance the quality of reporting medical evidence that is derived from survey studies and to maximize the efficiency of its consumption. Methods Reporting practices and quality of 100 random web- and 100 random non-web-based articles published from 2004 to 2016 were assessed using the SUrvey Reporting GuidelinE (SURGE). The CHERRIES guideline was also used to assess the reporting quality of Web-based studies. Results Our results revealed a potential gap in the reporting of many necessary checklist items in both web-based and non-web-based survey studies including development, description and testing of the questionnaire, the advertisement and administration of the questionnaire, sample representativeness and response rates, incentives, informed consent, and methods of statistical analysis. Conclusion Our findings confirm the presence of major discrepancies in reporting results of survey-based studies. This can be attributed to the lack of availability of updated universal checklists for quality of reporting standards. We have summarized our findings in a table that may serve as a roadmap for future guidelines and checklists, which will hopefully include all types and all aspects of survey research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advertising; Article; Checklist; Cherry; Consumer; Human; Human Experiment; Informed Consent; Nonhuman; Practice Guideline; Questionnaire; Statistical Analysis; Data Mining; Evidence Based Medicine; Internet; Data Mining; Evidence-based Medicine; Humans","advertising; article; checklist; cherry; consumer; human; human experiment; informed consent; nonhuman; practice guideline; questionnaire; statistical analysis; data mining; evidence based medicine; Internet; Data Mining; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans","","","This study was supported in part by a ""Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)"" (16H05844, 2016–2019 for Nguyen Tien Huy) from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.

However, evidence to support the need for inoculation to facilitate PPMS composting has only been demonstrated in one instance. In this study, we aimed to: screen and identify PPMS digesting thermophilic bacterial strains; investigate effects of the mixture of selected thermophilic bacterial strains on PPMS digestion; and utilize this mixture as start inoculum in PPMS composting and assess the quality of compost product. The results showed that eleven thermophilic bacterial strains were isolated from Bai Bang PPMS by the enrichment culture method. Among these, three strains which reflected high growth rates on the plates of Minimal Media Agar supplemented with Bai Bang PPMS and showed hydrolytic and ligninolytic activities on the agar plates containing appropriate inductive substrates were selected. Based on the morphological, biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, they were identified as Bacillus subtilis. The inoculation with the mixture of selected strains enhanced remarkably Bai Bang PPMS digestion. The dry weight decrease, volatile suspended solids removal, dehydrogenase and protease activities in the inoculated sludge were 2.1-, 1.5-, 1.3- and 1.2-fold higher, respectively, compared to the non-inoculated sludge. The assessment of compost quality based on stability using the alkaline trap method and maturity using the germination and root elongation test showed that the inoculated compost was stable and mature while the non-inoculated compost was unstable and immature. These thermophilic bacterial strains therefore have great potential for Bai Bang PPMS composting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacillus Subtilis; Composting; Paper Mill Sludge; Pulp; Thermophilic Bacteria; Biochemistry; Compost; Composting; Morphology; Pollutant Removal; Pulp And Paper Industry; Sludge; Substrate; Thermophilic Bacterium; Bacillus Subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms)","biochemistry; compost; composting; morphology; pollutant removal; pulp and paper industry; sludge; substrate; thermophilic bacterium; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms)","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number: 106-NN.04-2014.","Altschul, Stephen F., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs, Nucleic Acids Research, 25, 17, pp. 3389-3402, (1997); Compost Maturity Index, (2001); Campbell, Alton G., Composting and evaluating a pulp and paper sludge for use as a soil amendment/mulch, Compost Science and Utilization, 3, 1, pp. 84-95, (1995); Agronomic Benefits of Pulp and Paper Biosolids, (1998); Soil Science Society of America Journal, (1953); Fang, Min, Digestion activity of thermophilic bacteria isolated from ash-amended sewage sludge compost, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 126, 1-2, pp. 1-12, (2001); Evanylo, Gregory K., Paper mill sludge composting and compost utilization, Compost Science and Utilization, 7, 2, pp. 30-39, (1999); Hasegawa, S., Solubilization of organic sludge by thermophilic aerobic bacteria as a pretreatment for anaerobic digestion, Water Science and Technology, 41, 3, pp. 163-169, (2000); Jackson, Mark J., Organic Composition of a Pulp and Paper Mill Sludge Determined by FTIR, 13C CP MAS NMR, and Chemical Extraction Techniques, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 45, 6, pp. 2354-2358, (1997); Kim, Young-kee, Enhancement of proteolytic enzyme activity excreted from Bacillus stearothermophilus for a thermophilic aerobic digestion process, Bioresource Technology, 82, 2, pp. 157-164, (2002)","","Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia penerbit@ukm.my","","","","","","01266039","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049149379"

This study aims to investigate the association between depressive symptoms, particularly those in each domain of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, and related factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a random sample of 1319 medical students at Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy in 2016. The CES-D scale and a self-reported questionnaire were used to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms and related risk factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to assess the risk factors associated with depressive symptoms and the score for each structure factor. Depressive symptoms were observed in 514 (39%) students, including more males than females (44.2% vs 36.9%, p = 0.015). Students whose mothers’ highest education level was primary school had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than students whose mothers had higher education levels (p = 0.038). There was a significant relationship between depressive symptoms and stressful life events, especially a decline in personal health. A higher correlation was found between the somatic complaints and depressive affect domains. The impacts of risk factors differed for each domain of the depression scale. Only the factor of achieving excellence showed no statistically significant associations with depressive symptoms and the scores on the four domains considered in this study. The high prevalence of depressive symptoms among medical students with risk factors and the impact of these risk factors on each domain of depression scale need further clarification to alleviate depression in students during their medical training. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Center For Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Cross-sectional Study; Depression; Educational Status; Female; Human; Life Event; Male; Medical Student; Mother; Observational Study; Prevalence; Random Sample; Self Report; Sex Ratio; Viet Nam; Young Adult; Complication; Health Status; Mental Stress; Psychological Model; Psychological Rating Scale; Psychology; Risk Factor; Statistics And Numerical Data; Adult; Cross-sectional Studies; Depression; Educational Status; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Mothers; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Self Report; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Vietnam; Young Adult","adult; Article; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; cross-sectional study; depression; educational status; female; human; life event; male; medical student; mother; observational study; prevalence; random sample; self report; sex ratio; Viet Nam; young adult; complication; health status; mental stress; psychological model; psychological rating scale; psychology; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Educational Status; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Mothers; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Self Report; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Vietnam; Young Adult","","","","Depression and Other Common Mental Disorders Global Health Estimates, (2017); Vos, Theo, Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, The Lancet, 388, 10053, pp. 1545-1602, (2016); Depression Lets Talk, (2017); Ahn, Woo-kyoung, Mental health clinicians' beliefs about the biological, psychological, and environmental bases of mental disorders, Cognitive Science, 33, 2, pp. 147-182, (2009); Al-Sughayr, Abdulrhman M., Prevalence of mental disorders among high school students in National Guard Housing, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Journal of Family and Community Medicine, 19, 1, pp. 47-51, (2012); Int J Nurs Sci, (2015); Kunwar, Dipak, Study of depression, anxiety and stress among the medical students in two medical colleges of Nepal, Kathmandu University Medical Journal, 14, 53, pp. 22-26, (2016); Mental Health of Students in Higher Education, (2003); Dyrbye, Liselotte N., Systematic review of depression, anxiety, and other indicators of psychological distress among U.S. and Canadian medical students, Academic Medicine, 81, 4, pp. 354-373, (2006); Haldorsen, Hilde, Stress and symptoms of depression among medical students at the University of Copenhagen, Scandinavian Journal of Public Health, 42, 1, pp. 89-95, (2014)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","29566050","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044330484"

Such understanding will enable anticipation of region-specific responses to global environmental change. Modern phylogenies, in combination with broad coverage of species inventory data, now allow for global biogeographic analyses that take species evolutionary distance into account. Here we present a classification of the world's tropical forests based on their phylogenetic similarity. We identify five principal floristic regions and their floristic relationships: (i) Indo-Pacific, (ii) Subtropical, (iii) African, (iv) American, and (v) Dry forests. Our results do not support the traditional neo- versus paleotropical forest division but instead separate the combined American and African forests from their Indo-Pacific counterparts. We also find indications for the existence of a global dry forest region, with representatives in America, Africa, Madagascar, and India. Additionally, a northern-hemisphere Subtropical forest region was identified with representatives in Asia and America, providing support for a link between Asian and American northernhemisphere forests. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogeographic Legacies; Forest Classification; Forest Functional Similarity; Phylogenetic Community Distance; Tropical Forests; Article; Asia; Biogeography; Cladistics; Climate Change; Forest Dynamics; Forest Structure; India; Information Processing; Madagascar; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Priority Journal; Species Composition; Tropical Rain Forest; Western Hemisphere; Biodiversity; Classification; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Protection; Forest; Genetics; Plant; Tropic Climate; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Phylogeny; Plants; Tropical Climate","Article; Asia; biogeography; cladistics; climate change; forest dynamics; forest structure; India; information processing; Madagascar; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; species composition; tropical rain forest; Western Hemisphere; biodiversity; classification; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; genetics; plant; tropic climate; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Phylogeny; Plants; Tropical Climate","","","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

However, besides the sensitivity, a high selectivity is critically important to distinguish the true signal from interference signals in a non-controlled environment. This work presents the first demonstration of the successful integration of a novel peptide aptamer with a liquid-gated SWCNT FET to achieve highly sensitive and specific detection of Cathepsin E (CatE), a useful prognostic biomarker for cancer diagnosis. Novel peptide aptamers that specifically recognize CatE are engineered by systemic in vitro evolution. The SWCNTs were firstly grown using the thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and then were employed as a channel to fabricate a SWCNT FET device. Next, the SWCNTs were functionalized by noncovalent immobilization of the peptide aptamer using 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBASE) linker. The resulting FET sensors exhibited a high selectivity (no response to bovine serum albumin and cathepsin K) and label-free detection of CatE at unprecedentedly low concentrations in both phosphate-buffered saline (2.3 pM) and human serum (0.23 nM). Our results highlight the use of peptide aptamer-modified SWCNT FET sensors as a promising platform for near-patient testing and point-of-care testing applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cathepsin E; 1-pyrenebutyrate; Aptamers, Peptide; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cathepsin E; Nanotubes, Carbon; Pyrenes; Serum Albumin, Bovine; 1-pyrenebutyrate; Bovine Serum Albumin; Carbon Nanotube; Cathepsin E; Peptide Aptamer; Pyrene Derivative; Tumor Marker; Chemistry; Genetic Procedures; Human; Metabolism; Procedures; Prognosis; Sensitivity And Specificity; Transistor; Aptamers, Peptide; Biomarkers, Tumor; Biosensing Techniques; Cathepsin E; Humans; Nanotubes, Carbon; Prognosis; Pyrenes; Sensitivity And Specificity; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Transistors, Electronic","1-pyrenebutyrate; bovine serum albumin; carbon nanotube; cathepsin E; peptide aptamer; pyrene derivative; tumor marker; chemistry; genetic procedures; human; metabolism; procedures; prognosis; sensitivity and specificity; transistor; Aptamers, Peptide; Biomarkers, Tumor; Biosensing Techniques; Cathepsin E; Humans; Nanotubes, Carbon; Prognosis; Pyrenes; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Transistors, Electronic","","cathepsin E; 1-pyrenebutyrate; Aptamers, Peptide; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cathepsin E; Nanotubes, Carbon; Pyrenes; Serum Albumin, Bovine","The authors greatly appreciate the assistance of Prof. Mikio Koyano for his expert help in performing Raman spectroscopy of SWCNTs.

Among them, the endolithic community is the least studied. Its main function was considered to be translocation of photo-assimilates to the coral host, particularly during bleaching. Here, we hypothesize that (i) endolithic algae may show similar primary production rates in healthy or bleached corals by changing their pigment ratios, and therefore that similar production and translocation of organic matter may occur at both conditions and (ii) diazotrophs are components of the endolithic community; therefore, N<inf>2</inf> fixation and translocation of organic nitrogen may occur. We tested these hypotheses in incubation of Porites lutea with13 C and15 N tracers to measure primary production and N<inf>2</inf> fixation in coral tissues and endoliths. Assimilation of the13 C atom (%) was observed in healthy and bleached corals when the tracer was injected in the endolithic band, showing translocation in both conditions. N<inf>2</inf> fixation was found in coral tissues and endolithic communities with translocation of organic nitrogen. Thus, the endolithic community plays an important role in supporting the C and N metabolism of the holobiont, which may be crucial under changing environmental conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Endolithic Algae; Nitrogen Fixation; Ostreobium Quekettii; Porites Lutea; Primary Production; Translocation","","","","This study was supported by the Environmental Leaders Program of Shizuoka University (ELSU) through Research Promotion Grant of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT); grant-in-aid for Scientific Research No. 20121003 of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Japan; and 50th Anniversary Grant of the Mitsubishi Corporation on ‘Global Coral Reef Conservation Project (GCRCP).","Rohwer, Forest L., Diversity and distribution of coral-associated bacteria, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 243, pp. 1-10, (2002); Koren, Omry, Bacteria associated with mucus and tissues of the coral Oculina patagonica in summer and winter, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 72, 8, pp. 5254-5259, (2006); Rosenberg, Eugene, The role of microorganisms in coral health, disease and evolution, Nature Reviews Microbiology, 5, 5, pp. 355-362, (2007); Bourne, David G., Microbial disease and the coral holobiont, Trends in Microbiology, 17, 12, pp. 554-562, (2009); Rosenberg, Eugene, Symbiosis and development: The hologenome concept, Birth Defects Research Part C - Embryo Today: Reviews, 93, 1, pp. 56-66, (2011); Shashar, Nadav, Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) in stony corals - Evidence for coral-bacteria interactions, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 111, 3, pp. 259-264, (1994); Lesser, Michael P., Discovery of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in corals, Science, 305, 5686, pp. 997-1000, (2004); Ritchie, Kim B., Regulation of microbial populations by coral surface mucus and mucus-associated bacteria, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 322, pp. 1-14, (2006); Shnit-Orland, Maya, Coral mucus-associated bacteria: A possible first line of defense, FEMS Microbiology Ecology, 67, 3, pp. 371-380, (2009); Thompson, Janelle R., Microbes in the coral holobiont: Partners through evolution, development, and ecological interactions, Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, 4, DEC, (2014)","","Royal Society Publishing","","","","","","20545703","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037645039"

Vaccinations studied comprised Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, Triple vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), Polio, Measles, Rubella, Mumps, trivalent MMR vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (HiB) vaccine. We observed a protective association between any vaccination in the first year of life and risk of childhood leukemia (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.91]). When individual vaccines were analysed, some evidence of an association was seen only for BCG (summary OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.50-1.08]). In conclusion, early vaccination appears to be associated with a reduced risk of childhood leukemia. This finding may be underpinned by the association observed for BCG. Given the relatively imprecise nature of the results of this meta-analysis, our findings should be interpreted cautiously and replicated in future studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Haemophilus Vaccines; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Measles-mumps-rubella Vaccine; Vaccines, Combined; Haemophilus Vaccine; Hepatitis B Vaccine; Measles Mumps Rubella Vaccine; Vaccine; Human; Immunology; Leukemia; Meta Analysis; Procedures; Vaccination; Haemophilus Vaccines; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Humans; Leukemia; Measles-mumps-rubella Vaccine; Vaccination; Vaccines, Combined","Haemophilus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; vaccine; human; immunology; leukemia; meta analysis; procedures; vaccination; Haemophilus Vaccines; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Humans; Leukemia; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; Vaccination; Vaccines, Combined","","Haemophilus Vaccines; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; Vaccines, Combined","This work was supported in part by a “Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)” (16H05844, 2016–2019 for Nguyen Tien Huy) from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan and by the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (J-GRID) for Kenji Hirayama.

We carried out a cross-sectional survey on 1,503 HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy at two HIV clinics in Hanoi in 2016. Depression was prevalent in 26.2% of participants. Higher score of social support, especially emotional/informational support and positive social interaction, showed significant association with lower depression rate. Although family was primary source of all types of social support, receiving emotional/informational support not only from family but also from outside of family correlated with a lower proportion of depression. In countries with constrained social resources and/or with family-oriented social structures, as in Vietnam, expanding social networks between HIV populations and society is a potentially important option for reducing depression. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-hiv Agents; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy; Female; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Major Clinical Study; Male; Multicenter Study; Social Interaction; Social Network; Social Structure; Social Support; Viet Nam; Cohort Analysis; Cross-sectional Study; Depression; Family; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Outpatient Department; Pilot Study; Prevalence; Psychology; Quality Of Life; Self Report; Statistics And Numerical Data; Anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus Agent; Adult; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Anti-hiv Agents; Cohort Studies; Cross-sectional Studies; Depression; Family; Female; Hiv Infections; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Prevalence; Quality Of Life; Self Report; Social Networking; Social Support; Vietnam","adult; antiretroviral therapy; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; social interaction; social network; social structure; social support; Viet Nam; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; depression; family; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; outpatient department; pilot study; prevalence; psychology; quality of life; self report; statistics and numerical data; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; Adult; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Anti-HIV Agents; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Family; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Self Report; Social Networking; Social Support; Vietnam","","Anti-HIV Agents","We wish to thank Ms. Huyen Thi Nguyen, Ms. Yen Thi Nguyen, Ms. Mika Sata, and Ms. Keito Kawasaki for their help and support in data collection.

While we are well informed about forest growth under recent conditions, it is unclear if this knowledge can be simply transferred to urban environments. Based on tree ring analyses in ten metropolises worldwide, we show that, in general, urban trees have undergone accelerated growth since the 1960s. In addition, urban trees tend to grow more quickly than their counterparts in the rural surroundings. However, our analysis shows that climate change seems to enhance the growth of rural trees more than that of urban trees. The benefits of growing in an urban environment seem to outweigh known negative effects, however, accelerated growth may also mean more rapid ageing and shortened lifetime. Thus, city planners should adapt to the changed dynamics in order to secure the ecosystem services provided by urban trees. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aging; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Urban Area; City; City Planning; Growth, Development And Aging; Time Factor; Tree; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; Time Factors; Trees","aging; climate change; ecosystem; urban area; city; city planning; growth, development and aging; time factor; tree; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; Time Factors; Trees","","","The authors would like to thank the AUDI environmental foundation for funding the project “Response of urban trees on climate change” and the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection for funding the project TUF01UF-64971 “Urban trees under climate change: growth, functions & services, and perspectives”.

Under control conditions, Sar and Jan extracts improved chickpea growth which was attributed to their potential for increasing photosynthetic pigments, K+ and amino acids, particularly proline, in comparison with water-sprayed control. Upon stress imposition, chickpea growth was reduced in NaCl concentration-dependent manner, and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed Na+ accumulation and oxidative damage as major determinants of sensitivity at high salinity. Furthermore, amino acid quantification indicated activation/deactivation of overall metabolism in roots/shoots, as an adaptive strategy, for maintaining plant growth under salt stress. Sar and Jan extract supplementations provided stress amelioration, and PCA confirmed that improved growth parameters at high salinity were associated with enhanced activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. Besides, four key amino acids, including serine, threonine, proline and aspartic acids, were identified from roots which maximally contribute to Sar- and Jan-mediated stress amelioration. Sar showed higher effectiveness than Jan under both control and salt stress conditions.

The transgenic Tg2576 Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice were used to investigate the effect of chronic ad libitum drinking of RNPN solution for 6 months, including memory and learning functions, antioxidant activity, and amyloid plaque aggregation. The results showed that RNPN-treated mice had significantly attenuated cognitive deficits of both spatial and non-spatial memories, reduced oxidative stress of lipid peroxide, and DNA oxidation. RNPN treatment increased the percent inhibition of superoxide anion and glutathione peroxidase activity, neuronal densities in the cortex and hippocampus, decreased Aβ(1-40), Aβ(1-42) and gamma (γ)-secretase levels, and reduced Aβ plaque observed using immunohistochemistry analysis and thioflavin S staining. Our results suggest that RNPN may be a promising candidate for AD therapy because of its antioxidant properties and reduction in Aβ aggregation, thereby suppressing its adverse side effect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amyloid Beta Protein; Amyloid Beta-peptides; Amyloid Beta-protein (1-40); Amyloid Beta-protein (1-42); Antioxidants; Peptide Fragments; Amyloid Beta Protein; Amyloid Beta Protein[1-40]; Amyloid Beta-protein (1-42); Antioxidant; Nanoparticle; Peptide Fragment; Alzheimer Disease; Animal; Disease Model; Drug Effect; Female; Genetics; Hippocampus; Human; Lipid Peroxidation; Metabolism; Mouse; Pathology; Transgenic Mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Beta-peptides; Animals; Antioxidants; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Nanoparticles; Peptide Fragments","amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); antioxidant; nanoparticle; peptide fragment; Alzheimer disease; animal; disease model; drug effect; female; genetics; hippocampus; human; lipid peroxidation; metabolism; mouse; pathology; transgenic mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Antioxidants; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Nanoparticles; Peptide Fragments","","amyloid beta protein, 109770-29-8; Amyloid beta-Peptides; amyloid beta-protein (1-40); amyloid beta-protein (1-42); Antioxidants; Peptide Fragments","","Abbott, Alison C., Dementia: A problem for our age, Nature, 475, 7355 SUPPL., pp. S2-S4, (2011); Canter, Rebecca G., The road to restoring neural circuits for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Nature, 539, 7628, pp. 187-196, (2016); Ahmed, Mahiuddin Shamsuddin Mohamed, Structural conversion of neurotoxic amyloid-Β 1-42 oligomers to fibrils, Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, 17, 5, pp. 561-567, (2010); Glabe, Charles G., Structural classification of toxic amyloid oligomers, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 283, 44, pp. 29639-29643, (2008); Glabe, Charles G., Common mechanisms of amyloid oligomer pathogenesis in degenerative disease, Neurobiology of Aging, 27, 4, pp. 570-575, (2006); Kayed, Rakez, Permeabilization of lipid bilayers is a common conformation-dependent activity of soluble amyloid oligomers in protein misfolding diseases, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 279, 45, pp. 46363-46366, (2004); Camilleri, Angelique, Mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation by amyloid aggregates and protection by polyphenols, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Biomembranes, 1828, 11, pp. 2532-2543, (2013); Gauci, Alison J., Identification of polyphenolic compounds and black tea extract as potent inhibitors of lipid membrane destabilization by Aβ42 aggregates, Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 27, 4, pp. 767-779, (2011); Ladiwala, Ali Reza A., Polyphenolic Glycosides and Aglycones Utilize Opposing Pathways To Selectively Remodel and Inactivate Toxic Oligomers of Amyloid β, ChemBioChem, 12, 11, pp. 1749-1758, (2011); Ansari, Mubeen Ahmad, Protective effect of quercetin in primary neurons against Aβ(1-42): relevance to Alzheimer's disease, Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, 20, 4, pp. 269-275, (2009)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","28630497","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021086943"

We can perform sequencing directly in the field, where we collect the samples. Here, we report the development of a novel method to detect and genotype tropical disease pathogens, using dengue fever as a model. By combining the sequencer with isothermal amplification that only requires a water bath, we were able to amplify and sequence target viral genomes with ease. Starting from a serum sample, the entire procedure could be finished in a single day. The analysis of blood samples collected from 141 Indonesian patients demonstrated that this method enables the clinical identification and serotyping of the dengue virus with high sensitivity and specificity. The overall successful detection rate was 79%, and a total of 58 SNVs were detected. Similar analyses were conducted on 80 Vietnamese and 12 Thai samples with similar performance.

Initially, signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) expressed on immune cells has been identified as a crucial cellular receptor for CDV. Currently, nectin-4 expressed in epithelia has been shown to be another receptor for CDV. Our previous study demonstrated that neurons express nectin-4 and are infected with CDV. In this study, we investigated the distribution pattern of nectin-4 in various cell types in the canine central nervous system and showed its relation to CDV infection to further clarify the pathology of disease. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses were done using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of CDV-infected dogs. Dual staining of nectin-4 and CDV antigen or nectin-4 and brain cell markers was performed. Nectin-4 was detected in ependymal cells, epithelia of choroid plexus, meningeal cells, neurons, granular cells, and Purkinje's cells. CDV antigens were detected in these nectin-4-positive cells, further suggesting contribution of nectin-4 for the CDV neurovirulence. On the other hand, astrocytes did not express nectin-4, although they were frequently infected with CDV. Since astrocytes are negative for SLAM expression, they must express an unidentified CDV receptor, which also contributes to CDV neurovirulence. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nectins; Receptors, Virus; Nectin; Virus Receptor; Animal; Antibody Specificity; Astrocyte; Canine Distemper; Canine Distemper Virus; Central Nervous System; Dog; Metabolism; Nerve Cell; Pathology; Virology; Animals; Astrocytes; Central Nervous System; Distemper; Distemper Virus, Canine; Dogs; Nectins; Neurons; Organ Specificity; Receptors, Virus","nectin; virus receptor; animal; antibody specificity; astrocyte; canine distemper; Canine distemper virus; central nervous system; dog; metabolism; nerve cell; pathology; virology; Animals; Astrocytes; Central Nervous System; Distemper; Distemper Virus, Canine; Dogs; Nectins; Neurons; Organ Specificity; Receptors, Virus","","Nectins; Receptors, Virus","","Seki, Fumio, Efficient isolation of wild strains of canine distemper virus in Vero cells expressing canine SLAM (CD150) and their adaptability to marmoset B95a cells, Journal of Virology, 77, 18, pp. 9943-9950, (2003); Kumagai, Kazuyoshi, Lymphoid apoptosis in acute canine distemper, Journal of Veterinary Medical Science, 66, 2, pp. 175-181, (2004); Schobesberger, Martina, Canine distemper virus-induced depletion of uninfected lymphocytes is associated with apoptosis, Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology, 104, 1-2, pp. 33-44, (2005); Kajita, Masahiro, Canine distemper virus induces apoptosis through caspase-3 and -8 activation in vero cells, Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series B: Infectious Diseases and Veterinary Public Health, 53, 6, pp. 273-277, (2006); Beineke, Andreas, Pathogenesis and immunopathology of systemic and nervous canine distemper, Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology, 127, 1-2, pp. 1-18, (2009); Tan, Bin, Pathogenesis and phylogenetic analyses of canine distemper virus strain ZJ7 isolate from domestic dogs in China, Virology Journal, 8, (2011); Lempp, Charlotte, New aspects of the pathogenesis of canine distemper leukoencephalitis, Viruses, 6, 7, pp. 2571-2601, (2014); Pratakpiriya, Watanyoo, Nectin4 is an epithelial cell receptor for canine distemper virus and involved in neurovirulence, Journal of Virology, 86, 18, pp. 10207-10210, (2012); Appel, Max J.G., Distemper pathogenesis in dogs., Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, 156, 12, pp. 1681-1684, (1970); Von Messling, Veronika Al, Tropism illuminated: Lymphocyte-based pathways blazed by lethal morbillivirus through the host immune system, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101, 39, pp. 14216-14221, (2004)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","28336928","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016940905"

Of the seven major MTBC lineages in the world, lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic) mostly corresponds to the East African–Indian (EAI) spoligotype family in East Africa and Southeast Asia. Objectives: We investigated the genomic features of Vietnamese lineage 1 strains, comparing spoligotype patterns using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Methods: M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Da Nang, Vietnam were subjected to conventional spoligotyping, followed by WGS analysis using a high-throughput sequencer. Vietnamese lineage 1 strains were further analyzed with other lineage 1 strains obtained from a public database. Results: Indicating a major spoligotype in Da Nang, 86 (46.2%) of the 186 isolates belonged to the EAI family or lineage 1. Although typical EAI4-VNM strains are characterized by the deletion of spacers 26 and 27, 65 (75.6%) showed ambiguous signals on spacer 26. De novo assembly of the entire DR region and in silico spoligotyping analysis suggested the absence of spacer 26, and direct sequencing revealed that the 17th spacer sequence not used for conventional typing, was cross-hybridized to the spacer 26 probe. Vietnamese EAI4-VNM, other EAI-like strains, and those showing a non-EAI pattern lacking many spacers formed a monophyletic group separate from other EAI families in the world. Conclusion: Information about the alignment of spacers in the entire DR region obtained from WGS data provides a clue for the determination of experimentally ambiguous spoligo patterns. WGS data also helped to analyze the hidden relationships between apparently distinct spoligo patterns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna Probes; Article; Bacterial Strain; Bacteriophage Typing; Bacterium Isolate; Controlled Study; Cross Hybridization; Dna Sequence; High Throughput Sequencing; Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Spacer Oligonucleotide Typing; Viet Nam; Whole Genome Sequencing; Bacterial Genome; Classification; Dna Probe; Genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Dna Probes; Genome, Bacterial; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Vietnam","Article; bacterial strain; bacteriophage typing; bacterium isolate; controlled study; cross hybridization; DNA sequence; high throughput sequencing; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; phylogeny; spacer oligonucleotide typing; Viet Nam; whole genome sequencing; bacterial genome; classification; DNA probe; genetics; polymerase chain reaction; DNA Probes; Genome, Bacterial; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Vietnam","","DNA Probes","","Kato-Maeda, Midori, Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Application in epidemiologic studies, Future Microbiology, 6, 2, pp. 203-216, (2011); Coll, Francesc, A robust SNP barcode for typing Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains, Nature Communications, 5, (2014); Gagneux, Sébastien P., Variable host-pathogen compatibility in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 103, 8, pp. 2869-2873, (2006); Firdessa, Rebuma, Mycobacterial lineages causing pulmonary and extrapulmonary Tuberculosis, Ethiopia, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 19, 3, pp. 460-463, (2013); Kamerbeek, Judith, Simultaneous detection and strain differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for diagnosis and epidemiology, Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 35, 4, pp. 907-914, (1997); Van-Embden, Jan D.A., Strain identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by DNA fingerprinting: Recommendations for a standardized methodology, Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 31, 2, pp. 406-409, (1993); Van-Embden, Jan D.A., Genetic variation and evolutionary origin of the direct repeat locus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacteria, Journal of Bacteriology, 182, 9, pp. 2393-2401, (2000); Cowan, Lauren Steinlein, Transfer of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genotyping Method, Spoligotyping, from a Reverse Line-Blot Hybridization, Membrane-Based Assay to the Luminex Multianalyte Profiling System, Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 42, 1, pp. 474-477, (2004); Zhang, Jianmin, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex CRISPR genotyping: Improving efficiency, throughput and discriminative power of 'spoligotyping' with new spacers and a microbead-based hybridization assay, Journal of Medical Microbiology, 59, 3, pp. 285-294, (2010); Brudey, Karine, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genetic diversity: Mining the fourth international spoligotyping database (SpolDB4) for classification, population genetics and epidemiology, BMC Microbiology, 6, (2006)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","29049400","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031747559"

In this study, we report anti-inflammatory and wound healing activities of the major calophyllolide (CP) compound isolated from Calophyllum inophyllum Linn. The results showed that CP had no effect on HaCaT cell viability over a range of concentrations. CP reduced fibrosis formation and effectively promoted wound closure in mouse model without causing body weight loss. The underlying molecular mechanisms of wound repair by CP was investigated. CP markedly reduced MPO activity, and increased M2 macrophage skewing, as shown by up-regulation of M2-related gene expression, which is beneficial to the wound healing process. CP treatment prevented a prolonged inflammatory process by down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines—IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, but up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. This study is the first to indicate a plausible role for CP in accelerating the process of wound healing through anti-inflammatory activity mechanisms, namely, by regulation of inflammatory cytokines, reduction in MPO, and switching of macrophages to an M2 phenotype. These findings may enable the utilization of CP as a potent therapeutic for cutaneous wound healing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Myeloperoxidase; Dodecyl Sulfate Sodium; Peroxidase; Anti-inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; Calophyllolid; Coumarins; Cytokines; Inflammation Mediators; Peroxidase; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Antiinflammatory Agent; Calophyllolide; Interleukin 10; Interleukin 1beta; Interleukin 6; Myeloperoxidase; Plant Medicinal Product; Tumor Necrosis Factor; Unclassified Drug; Wound Healing Promoting Agent; Autacoid; Biological Marker; Calophyllolid; Coumarin Derivative; Cytokine; Dodecyl Sulfate Sodium; Peroxidase; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Antiinflammatory Activity; Article; Blood Sampling; Calophyllum; Calophyllum Inophyllum; Cell Viability; Concentration (parameters); Controlled Study; Down Regulation; Drug Efficacy; Drug Isolation; Enzyme Activity; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fibrosis; Gene Expression; Hacat Cell Line; Histology; Human; Human Cell; Macrophage; Male; Molecular Mechanics; Mouse; Nonhuman; Plant Seed; Quantitative Analysis; Raw 264.7 Cell Line; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Spleen; Upregulation; Wound Closure; Wound Healing; Animal; Cell Survival; Chemistry; Drug Effects; Gene Expression Regulation; Isolation And Purification; Metabolism; Pathology; Skin; Animals; Anti-inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; Cell Survival; Coumarins; Cytokines; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Peroxidase; Raw 264.7 Cells; Seeds; Skin; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Spleen; Wound Healing","antiinflammatory agent; calophyllolide; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; myeloperoxidase; plant medicinal product; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; wound healing promoting agent; autacoid; biological marker; calophyllolid; coumarin derivative; cytokine; dodecyl sulfate sodium; peroxidase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; blood sampling; Calophyllum; Calophyllum inophyllum; cell viability; concentration (parameters); controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug isolation; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fibrosis; gene expression; HaCat cell line; histology; human; human cell; macrophage; male; molecular mechanics; mouse; nonhuman; plant seed; quantitative analysis; RAW 264.7 cell line; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; spleen; upregulation; wound closure; wound healing; animal; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; gene expression regulation; isolation and purification; metabolism; pathology; skin; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; Cell Survival; Coumarins; Cytokines; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Peroxidase; RAW 264.7 Cells; Seeds; Skin; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Spleen; Wound Healing","","myeloperoxidase; dodecyl sulfate sodium, 151-21-3; peroxidase, 9003-99-0; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; calophyllolid; Coumarins; Cytokines; Inflammation Mediators; Peroxidase; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate","","Johnstone, Carolyn Catherine, The physiological basics of wound healing., Nursing Standard, 19, 43, pp. 59-66, (2005); Han, Dongoh, Wound healing activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in rats, Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology, 17, 10, pp. 1661-1669, (2007); Strodtbeck, Frances, Physiology of wound healing, Newborn and Infant Nursing Reviews, 1, 1, pp. 43-52, (2001); Pazyar, Nader, Skin wound healing and phytomedicine: A review, Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, 27, 6, pp. 303-310, (2014); Guo, Shujuan, Critical review in oral biology & medicine: Factors affecting wound healing, Journal of Dental Research, 89, 3, pp. 219-229, (2010); Demidova-Rice, Tatiana N., Acute and impaired wound healing: Pathophysiology and current methods for drug delivery, part 1: Normal and chronic wounds: Biology, causes, and approaches to care, Advances in Skin and Wound Care, 25, 7, pp. 304-314, (2012); Abdoli, Amir, Wound healing in cutaneous leishmaniasis: A double edged sword of IL-10 and TGF-β, Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, 51, pp. 15-26, (2017); Bielefeld, Kirsten Adele, Cutaneous wound healing: Recruiting developmental pathways for regeneration, Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, 70, 12, pp. 2059-2081, (2013); Young, Alistair, The physiology of wound healing, Surgery (United Kingdom), 29, 10, pp. 475-479, (2011); Zhang, Junming, Cytokines, inflammation, and pain, International Anesthesiology Clinics, 45, 2, pp. 27-37, (2007)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","29020015","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031004599"

A solution of the nonlinear cable equation modified for fissured intracellular medium with a source term representing charge ‘soakage’ is used to show how intracellular capacitive effects of bound electrical charges within mitochondrial membranes can influence electrotonic signals expressed as solitary waves. The elastic collision resulting from a head-on collision of two solitary waves results in localized and non-dispersing electrical solitons created by the nonlinearity of the source term. It has been shown that solitons in neurons with mitochondrial membrane and quasi-electrostatic interactions of charges held by the microstructure (i.e., charge ‘soakage’) have a slower velocity of propagation compared with solitons in neurons with microstructure, but without endoplasmic membranes. When the equilibrium potential is a small deviation from rest, the nonohmic conductance acts as a leaky channel and the solitons are small compared when the equilibrium potential is large and the outer mitochondrial membrane acts as an amplifier, boosting the amplitude of the endogenously generated solitons. These findings demonstrate a functional role of quasi-electrostatic interactions of bound electrical charges held by microstructure for sustaining solitons with robust self-regulation in their amplitude through changes in the mitochondrial membrane equilibrium potential. The implication of our results indicate that a phenomenological description of ionic current can be successfully modeled with displacement current in Maxwell’s equations as a conduction process involving quasi-electrostatic interactions without the inclusion of diffusive current. This is the first study in which solitonic conduction of electrotonic potentials are generated by polarization-induced capacitive current in microstructure and nonohmic mitochondrial membrane current. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amplitude Modulation; Article; Controlled Study; Depolarization; Diffusion; Dispersion; Electric Capacitance; Electric Conductivity; Electrochemical Analysis; Electromagnetism; Ion Current; Mitochondrial Membrane Potential; Polarization; Static Electricity; Action Potential; Biological Model; Metabolism; Mitochondrial Membrane; Nerve Cell; Physiology; Action Potentials; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mitochondrial Membranes; Models, Neurological; Neurons","amplitude modulation; Article; controlled study; depolarization; diffusion; dispersion; electric capacitance; electric conductivity; electrochemical analysis; electromagnetism; ion current; mitochondrial membrane potential; polarization; static electricity; action potential; biological model; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane; nerve cell; physiology; Action Potentials; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mitochondrial Membranes; Models, Neurological; Neurons","","","","Hodgkin, Alan L., A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve, Journal of Physiology, 117, 4, pp. 500-544, (1952); Frankenhaeuser, Bernhard, The action potential in the myelinated nerve fibre of Xenopus laevis as computed on the basis of voltage clamp data, Journal of Physiology, 171, 2, pp. 302-315, (1964); Poznański, Roman R., Analytical solutions of the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations.

We performed a detailed genetic analysis of 48 residents and four families from Binh Thuan Province, a southern coastal area of Vietnam. The route of infection and genomic characteristics related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were studied in HBV spread among carriers that we detected in our previous hepatitis survey. The HBV genotype was B4 in 91.7% and C1 in 8.3% of the cases. The intra-family’s HBV sequence homology was high at 96.8–99.4%. However, it was also high at 99.4–99.8% among residents of the same age and sex as family members. In addition, full genome analysis was performed in 21 cases. The core region of all 20 isolates with genotype B4 was a recombinant of genotype C, and pre-S deletion was found in 20% of cases. The promoter mutation G1613A was found in 13.6% of cases, and a 24 bp insertion from nt1673 in the X region was found in 6.3% of cases. The phylogenetic tree and homology analysis of the HBV full genome suggested the probability and its possibility of horizontal transmission not only within families nor vertical transmission but within cohorts of the same generation in the population. Moreover, the HBV genotype B4 isolates were found not only to be recombinants of genotype C, which results in a high cancer risk, but also to have other risk of HCC, pre-S deletions, the G1613A mutation, and X region insertions corresponding to the promoter. These genomic characters were suggested to be one of the factors to explain the high HCC mortality rate in Vietnam. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Viral; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Article; Cancer Mortality; Controlled Study; Disease Transmission; Female; Gene Cluster; Gene Insertion; Gene Mutation; Genetic Analysis; Genetic Code; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Virus; Hepatitis B Virus Genotype B4; Human; Infection Sensitivity; Liver Cell Carcinoma; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Population Research; Sequence Homology; Sex Difference; Vertical Transmission; Viet Nam; Virus Isolation; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Classification; Genetics; Genotype; Liver Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Virology; Virus Genome; Virus Dna; Adult; Dna, Viral; Female; Genome, Viral; Genotype; Hepatitis B; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Vietnam","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; cancer mortality; controlled study; disease transmission; female; gene cluster; gene insertion; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic code; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype B4; human; infection sensitivity; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; phylogeny; population research; sequence homology; sex difference; vertical transmission; Viet Nam; virus isolation; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; classification; genetics; genotype; Liver Neoplasms; middle aged; polymerase chain reaction; virology; virus genome; virus DNA; Adult; DNA, Viral; Female; Genome, Viral; Genotype; Hepatitis B; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Vietnam","","DNA, Viral","","Hepatitits B Media Center of Who2016; Ghendon, Youri Z., Perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus in highincidence countries, Journal of Virological Methods, 17, 1-2, pp. 69-79, (1987); Franks, Adele L., Hepatitis B Virus Infection among Children Born in the United States to Southeast Asian Refugees, New England Journal of Medicine, 321, 19, pp. 1301-1305, (1989); Marinier, Evelyne M., Lack of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus infection in senegal, West Africa, Journal of Pediatrics, 106, 5, pp. 843-849, (1985); Basalamah, Abdullah H., Materno-foetal transmission of hepatitis B in Saudi Arabia, Journal of Infection, 8, 3, pp. 200-204, (1984); Li, Zixiong, Is mother-to-infant transmission the most important factor for persistent HBV infection?, Emerging Microbes and Infections, 4, 5, (2015); Kramvis, Anna, Epidemiology of hepatitis B virus in Africa, its genotypes and clinical associations of genotypes, Hepatology Research, 37, SUPPL. 1, pp. S9-S19, (2007); Hadziyannis, Stephanos J., Natural history of chronic hepatitis B in Euro-Mediterranean and African Countries, Journal of Hepatology, 55, 1, pp. 183-191, (2011); Nguyen, Van Thi Thuy, Highly endemic hepatitis B infection in rural Vietnam, Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (Australia), 22, 12, pp. 2093-2100, (2007); Tran, Huy Thien Tuan, Prevalence of hepatitis virus types B through E and genotypic distribution of HBV and HCV in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Hepatology Research, 26, 4, pp. 275-280, (2003)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","28753615","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026358464"

Between 2007 and 2012, HBV prevalence was significantly decreased in BD (18.1% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.007) and slightly decreased in FSW (11.0% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.21), but not in PWID (10.7% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.84). HCV prevalence was significantly decreased in PWID (62.1% in 2007 vs. 42.7% in 2008, p < 0.0001), but it had rebounded to 58.4% in 2012 (2008 vs. 2012, p < 0.0001). HCV prevalence also increased in FSW: 28.6% in 2007 and 2009 vs. 35.3% in 2012; however, this difference was not significant (2007 vs. 2012, p = 0.41). Rates of coinfection with HBV and HCV among HIV-infected PWID and FSW did not change significantly during the study period. Our findings suggest that the current harm reduction programs designed to prevent HIV transmission in PWID and FSW may be insufficient to prevent the transmission of hepatitis viruses, particularly HCV, in Haiphong, Vietnam. New approaches, such as the introduction of catch-up HBV vaccination to vulnerable adult populations and the introduction of HCV treatment as prevention, should be considered to reduce morbidity and mortality due to HIV and hepatitis virus coinfection in Vietnam. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Controlled Study; Disease Transmission; Female; Harm Reduction; Health Program; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Virus; Hepatitis C; Hepatitis C Virus; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Infection Prevention; Intravenous Drug Abuse; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mixed Infection; Prevalence; Sex Worker; Trend Study; Viet Nam; Vulnerable Population; Hiv Infections; Prostitution; Substance Abuse; Young Adult; Adult; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Sex Work; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Vietnam; Young Adult","adult; Article; controlled study; disease transmission; female; harm reduction; health program; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; intravenous drug abuse; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; prevalence; sex worker; trend study; Viet Nam; vulnerable population; HIV Infections; prostitution; substance abuse; young adult; Adult; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Sex Work; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Vietnam; Young Adult","","","","Degenhardt, Louisa J., Estimating the burden of disease attributable to injecting drug use as a risk factor for HIV, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 16, 12, pp. 1385-1398, (2016); Ishizaki, Azumi, Profile of HIV type 1 infection and genotypic resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs in treatment-naive HIV type 1-infected individuals in Hai Phong, Viet Nam, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, 25, 2, pp. 175-182, (2009); Tran, Vuong Thi, No increase of drug-resistant HIV type 1 prevalence among drug-naive individuals in northern vietnam, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, 28, 10, pp. 1349-1351, (2012); Pham, Hung Viet, Change in the Prevalence of HIV-1 and the Rate of Transmitted Drug-Resistant HIV-1 in Haiphong, Northern Vietnam, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, 31, 7, pp. 757-759, (2015); Vietnam AIDS Response Report 2014 Following Up the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV AIDS Reporting Period January 2012 December 2013 National Committee for AIDS Drug and Prostitution Prevention and Control, (2014); Smith, Colette Joanne, Trends in underlying causes of death in people with HIV from 1999 to 2011 (D:A:D): A multicohort collaboration, The Lancet, 384, 9939, pp. 241-248, (2014); Joshi, Deepak, Increasing burden of liver disease in patients with HIV infection, The Lancet, 377, 9772, pp. 1198-1209, (2011); Zhang, Fujie, HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus co-infection in patients in the China national free antiretroviral treatment program, 2010-12: A retrospective observational cohort study, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 14, 11, pp. 1065-1072, (2014); Nguyen, Cuong Hung, Prevalence of HBV infection among different HIV-risk groups in Hai Phong, Vietnam, Journal of Medical Virology, 83, 3, pp. 399-404, (2011); Tanimoto, Tomoaki, Multiple routes of hepatitis C virus transmission among injection drug users in Hai Phong, Northern Vietnam, Journal of Medical Virology, 82, 8, pp. 1355-1363, (2010)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","28662105","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021650875"

Fourteen participants died and six became untraceable by October 2013; the remaining 21 children were followed up from 2013 to 2015. Thirteen and seven participants had hearing and functional ophthalmological impairment, respectively. Developmental difficulties were suspected in 19 (95%) children who failed in at least one area of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and/or Denver II in 2013 and/or 2015. Developmental difficulties were frequently identified in the ASQ communication domain (n = 14 in 2013) and Denver II language area (n = 13 in 2013). Seven (41%) participants were suspected of having autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 2013 by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers. In 2015, proportions of children failing the problem-solving (62%) and personal-social (62%) domains had increased and two of 13 were diagnosed with ASD by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition.

This fact supports the protection hypothesis against malaria. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the presence and the extent of protective association between G6PD deficiency and malaria. Thirteen databases were searched for papers reporting any G6PD alteration in malaria patients. Twenty-eight of the included 30 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. Results showed absence of negative association between G6PD deficiency and uncomplicated falciparum malaria (odds ratio (OR), 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59-1.02; p = 0.07). However, this negative association happened in Africa (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.86; p = 0.007) but not in Asia (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.96-1.61; p = 0.10), and in the heterozygotes (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.87; p = 0.001) but not the homo/hemizygous (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.07; p = 0.10). There was no association between G6PD deficiency and total severe malaria (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61-1.11; p = 0.20). Similarly, there was no association with other malaria species. G6PD deficiency can potentially protect against uncomplicated malaria in African countries, but not severe malaria. Interestingly, this protection was mainly in heterozygous, being x-linked thus related to gender. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase; Complication; Enzymology; Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Heterozygote; Human; Malaria Falciparum; Meta Analysis; Metabolism; Physiology; Plasmodium Falciparum; Species Difference; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Heterozygote; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; Species Specificity","glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; complication; enzymology; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; heterozygote; human; malaria falciparum; meta analysis; metabolism; physiology; Plasmodium falciparum; species difference; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Heterozygote; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; Species Specificity","","glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, 37259-83-9, 9001-40-5; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase","","Allison, Anthony C., Malaria and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Nature, 197, 4867, (1963); Ruwende, Cyril, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and malaria, Journal of Molecular Medicine, 76, 8, pp. 581-588, (1998); Ruwende, Cyril, Natural selection of hemi– and heterozygotes for g6pd deficiency in africa by resistance to severe malaria, Nature, 376, 6537, pp. 246-249, (1995); Brandt, Oliver, Peas, beans, and the Pythagorean theorem - The relevance of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in dermatology, JDDG - Journal of the German Society of Dermatology, 6, 7, pp. 534-539, (2008); Adinortey, Michael Buenor, The significance of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in plasmodium falciparum malaria: A case study of patients visiting the Central Regional Hospital, Cape Coast, Ghana, World Journal of Medical Sciences, 6, 3, pp. 126-130, (2011); Vega-Rodríguez, Joel, The glutathione biosynthetic pathway of Plasmodium is essential for mosquito transmission, PLOS Pathogens, 5, 2, (2009); Allison, Anthony C., Malaria in african children with deficient erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, BMJ, 1, 5236, pp. 1346-1349, (1961); Allison, Anthony C., Malaria and Glucose-6-phosphate Dchydrogenase, BMJ, 2, 5250, pp. 521-522, (1961); Bottini, Egidio, On the relation between malaria and G-6-PD deficiency, Journal of Medical Genetics, 15, 5, pp. 363-365, (1978); Journal Medicinal and Medical Sciences3, (2012)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","28382932","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017110367"

We conducted a birth cohort study of 1999 neonates between May 2009 and May 2010 in Nha Trang, Vietnam, to evaluate paternal tobacco smoking as a risk factor for infectious and non-infectious diseases. Hospitalizations during a 24-month observation period were identified using hospital records. The effect of paternal exposure during pregnancy and infancy on infectious disease incidence was evaluated using Poisson regression models. In total, 35.6% of 1624 children who attended follow-up visits required at least one hospitalization by 2 years of age, and the most common reason for hospitalization was lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Paternal tobacco smoking independently increased the risk of LRTI 1.76-fold (95% CI: 1.24-2.51) after adjusting for possible confounders but was not associated with any other cause of hospitalization. The population attributable fraction indicated that effective interventions to prevent paternal smoking in the presence of children would reduce LRTI-related hospitalizations by 14.8% in this epidemiological setting. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child; Cohort Analysis; Environmental Exposure; Father; Hospitalization; Human; Incidence; Respiratory Tract Infection; Risk Assessment; Smoking; Viet Nam; Child; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Fathers; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk Assessment; Tobacco Smoking; Vietnam","child; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; father; hospitalization; human; incidence; respiratory tract infection; risk assessment; smoking; Viet Nam; Child; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Fathers; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk Assessment; Tobacco Smoking; Vietnam","","","","Fischer-Walker, Christa L., Global burden of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea, The Lancet, 381, 9875, pp. 1405-1416, (2013); Anh, Dang Duc, Treatment costs of pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, and other diseases among hospitalized children in Viet Nam, Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition, 28, 5, pp. 436-442, (2010); Fischer, Thea K., Health care costs of diarrheal disease and estimates of the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 192, 10, pp. 1720-1726, (2005); Le, Phuchong, The economic burden of pneumonia and meningitis among children less than five years old in Hanoi, Vietnam, Tropical Medicine and International Health, 19, 11, pp. 1321-1327, (2014); Liu, Li, Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: An updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000, The Lancet, 379, 9832, pp. 2151-2161, (2012); Håberg, Siri E., Effects of pre- and postnatal exposure to parental smoking on early childhood respiratory health, American Journal of Epidemiology, 166, 6, pp. 679-686, (2007); Jurado, Dolores, Is maternal smoking more determinant than paternal smoking on the respiratory symptoms of young children?, Respiratory Medicine, 99, 9, pp. 1138-1144, (2005); Jaakkola, Jouni J.K., Prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoke exposure and respiratory health in Russian children, Respiratory Research, 7, (2006); Jȩdrychowski, Wiesław A., Early wheezing phenotypes and severity of respiratory illness in very early childhood.

Here, we demonstrated the ability of an artificial nucleic acid (an aptamer) to similarly control the functionality of a non-biological element. Specifically, we selected an RNA aptamer that binds tris(bipyridine) ruthenium (II), Ru(bpy)<inf>3</inf>2+, an inorganic complex that has attracted intense interest due to its photoredox chemistry, including its ability to split water by visible light. We found that a newly discovered aptamer strongly and enantioselectively binds A-Ru(bpy)<inf>3</inf>2+ (K<inf>d</inf> = 65 nM) and, in doing so, selectively suppresses deactivation via energy transfer, thereby elongating the lifetime of its photo-excited state by four-fold. The ability of the aptamer to enhance this important aspect of Ru(bpy)<inf>3</inf>2+ chemistry illustrates a broader point concerning the potential power of combining in vitro-created biomolecules with non-biological reactants to perform enhanced chemical reactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aptamers, Nucleotide; Organometallic Compounds; Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(ii); Aptamer; Organometallic Compound; Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(ii); Calorimetry; Chemistry; Photochemistry; Thermodynamics; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Calorimetry; Organometallic Compounds; Photochemical Processes; Thermodynamics","aptamer; organometallic compound; tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II); calorimetry; chemistry; photochemistry; thermodynamics; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Calorimetry; Organometallic Compounds; Photochemical Processes; Thermodynamics","","Aptamers, Nucleotide; Organometallic Compounds; tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant numbers 23750202 and 26708020) and the incentive research fund of RIKEN.

The sizes of deletion varied between 582 nt (194 aa) and 648 nt (216 aa) at positions 28-714 (10-238) on the S gene (protein). Among 17 PEDV samples isolated from individual pigs, all of them contained at least two distinct genotypes with large genomic deletions, and 94.1% of them were found to consist of strains with an intact S gene. These variants were found in eight primary and nine recurrent outbreaks, and they might be associated with persistent PEDV infection in the farms. Full-length S and ORF3 genes of eight variants derived from 2 samples were characterized.

NKG2D, an activating receptor expressed by NK cells, plays an important role in cancer immune-surveillance. We analyzed the impact of a NKG2D gene variant, rs1049174, on the incidence of HPV-related cancers in Vietnamese patients and utilized various molecular approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of NKG2D receptor regulation by rs1049174. In a group of 123 patients with HPV+ anogenital cancers, the low cytotoxicity allele LNK was significantly associated with increased cancer susceptibility (p = 0.016). Similar results were also observed in a group of 153 women with cervical cancer (p = 0.05). In functional studies, NK cells from individuals with LNK genotype showed a lower NKG2D expression and displayed less efficient NKG2D-mediated functions than NK cells with HNK genotype. Notably, the rs1049174 variant occurs within a targeting site for miR-1245, a negative regulator of NKG2D expression. Compared with the higher cytotoxicity allele HNK, the LNK allele was more efficiently targeted by miR-1245 and thus determined lower NKG2D expression in NK cells with the LNK genotype. The NKG2D variants may influence cancer immunosurveillance and thus determine susceptibility to various malignancies, including HPV-induced cancers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gamma Interferon; 3' Untranslated Regions; Interferon-gamma; Micrornas; Nk Cell Lectin-like Receptor Subfamily K; Transforming Growth Factor Beta1; Gamma Interferon; Microrna; Natural Killer Cell Lectin Like Receptor Subfamily K; Transforming Growth Factor Beta1; 3' Untranslated Region; Adult; Aged; Allele; Antagonists And Inhibitors; Cd8+ T Lymphocyte; Cell Culture; Chemistry; Cytology; Cytotoxicity; Disease Predisposition; Drug Effect; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Frequency; Genetics; Genotype; Hela Cell Line; Human; Immunology; Isolation And Purification; Male; Metabolism; Middle Aged; Natural Killer Cell; Nucleotide Sequence; Papillomaviridae; Pathology; Sequence Alignment; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Urogenital Tract Tumor; Virology; 3' Untranslated Regions; Adult; Aged; Alleles; Base Sequence; Cd8-positive T-lymphocytes; Cells, Cultured; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Hela Cells; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Killer Cells, Natural; Male; Micrornas; Middle Aged; Nk Cell Lectin-like Receptor Subfamily K; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Alignment; Transforming Growth Factor Beta1; Urogenital Neoplasms","gamma interferon; microRNA; natural killer cell lectin like receptor subfamily K; transforming growth factor beta1; 3' untranslated region; adult; aged; allele; antagonists and inhibitors; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell culture; chemistry; cytology; cytotoxicity; disease predisposition; drug effect; female; gene expression regulation; gene frequency; genetics; genotype; HeLa cell line; human; immunology; isolation and purification; male; metabolism; middle aged; natural killer cell; nucleotide sequence; Papillomaviridae; pathology; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; urogenital tract tumor; virology; 3' Untranslated Regions; Adult; Aged; Alleles; Base Sequence; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cells, Cultured; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Frequency; Genotype; HeLa Cells; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Killer Cells, Natural; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Alignment; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Urogenital Neoplasms","","gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; 3' Untranslated Regions; Interferon-gamma; MicroRNAs; NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K; Transforming Growth Factor beta1","This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology, and funds from the Grant-in-Aid for Scientifc Research, Founds from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (for JLE).","Schiffman, Mark H., Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer, The Lancet, 370, 9590, pp. 890-907, (2007); Luttmer, Roosmarijn, Management of high-risk HPV-positive women for detection of cervical (pre)cancer, Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics, 16, 9, pp. 961-974, (2016); Egawa, Nagayasau, Human papillomaviruses; Epithelial tropisms, and the development of neoplasia, Viruses, 7, 7, pp. 3863-3890, (2015); Torre, Lindsey A., Global cancer statistics, 2012, Ca-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 65, 2, pp. 87-108, (2015); Waldhauer, Inja, NK cells and cancer immunosurveillance, Oncogene, 27, 45, pp. 5932-5943, (2008); Gonzalez, Segundo, NKG2D ligands: key targets of the immune response, Trends in Immunology, 29, 8, pp. 397-403, (2008); Burgess, Steven J., The NKG2D receptor: Immunobiology and clinical implications, Immunologic Research, 40, 1, pp. 18-34, (2008); Imai, Kazue, Natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral-blood lymphocytes and cancer incidence: An 11-year follow-up study of a general population, The Lancet, 356, 9244, pp. 1795-1799, (2000); Hayashi, Tomonori, Identification of the NKG2D haplotypes associated with natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes and cancer immunosurveillance, Cancer Research, 66, 1, pp. 563-570, (2006); Espinoza, Luis J., NKG2D gene polymorphism has a significant impact on transplant outcomes after HLA-fully-matched unrelated bone marrow transplantation for standard risk hematologic malignancies, Haematologica, 94, 10, pp. 1427-1434, (2009)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","27995954","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006802814"

After all, the news are essentially created to convey information to the public. But can we go beyond what is directly presented to us and see a wider picture? Many works already focus on what we can discover and understand from the analysis of years of news broadcasting. These analysis bring monitoring and understanding of the activity of public figures, political strategies, explanation and even prediction of critical media events. Such tools can help public figures in managing their public image, as well as support the work of journalists, social scientists and other media experts. News analysis can also be seen from the lens of complex systems, gathering many types of entities, attributes and interactions over time. As many public figures intervene in different news stories, a first interesting task is to observe the social interactions between these actors. Towards this goal, we propose to use video analysis to automatise the process of constructing social networks directly from news video archives. In this paper we are introducing a system deriving multiple social networks from face detections in news videos. We present preliminary results obtained from analysis of these networks, by monitoring the activity of more than a hundred public figures. We finally use these networks as a support for political studies and we provide an overview of the political landscape presented by the Japanese public broadcaster NHK over a decade of the 7 PM news archives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic; Face Detection And Tracking; Japan; Multiplex; News Analysis; Politics; Social Network Analysis; Data Handling; Social Networking (online); Face Detection And Tracking; Face Tracking; Japan; Multiplex; News Analyse; News Video; Politic; Public Figure; Public Support; Social Network Analysis; Face Recognition","Data handling; Social networking (online); Face detection and tracking; Face Tracking; Japan; Multiplex; News analyse; News video; Politic; Public figure; Public support; Social Network Analysis; Face recognition","","","We would like to thank the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science for funding this research (as part of the FY2015 Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research).

However, the stakeholders sometimes describe the system with ambiguous, vague or fuzzy terms, hence formal frameworks for modeling and verifying such requirements are desirable. The Fuzzy If–Then rules have been used for imprecise requirements representation, but verifying their functional properties still needs new methods. In this paper, we propose a refinement-based modeling approach for specification and verification of such requirements. First, we introduce a representation of imprecise requirements in the set theory. Then we make use of Event-B refinement providing a set of translation rules from Fuzzy If–Then rules to Event-B notations. After that, we show how to verify both safety and eventuality properties with RODIN/Event-B. Finally, we illustrate the proposed method on the example of Crane Controller. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analysis; Event-b; Imprecise Requirements","","","","","Modeling in Event B System and Software Engineering, (2010); Abrial, Jean Raymond, Rodin: An open toolset for modelling and reasoning in Event-B, International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer, 12, 6, pp. 447-466, (2010); Abrial, Jean Raymond, Formalizing hybrid systems with event-B, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7316 LNCS, pp. 178-193, (2012); Software Engineering with Computational Intelligence Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing, (2003); undefined; Han, Deshuai, Extending UML for the modeling of fuzzy self-adaptive software systems, pp. 2400-2406, (2014); Hoang, Thai Son, Reasoning about liveness properties in event-B, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6991 LNCS, pp. 456-471, (2011); Intrigila, Benedetto, A model checking technique for the verification of fuzzy control systems, 1, pp. 536-542, (2005); Proc Kse, (2014); Le, Hong Anh, Verifying eventuality properties of imprecise system requirements using event-B, Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, 13-17-April-2015, pp. 1651-1653, (2015)","","SpringerOpen","","","","","","21931801","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978032430"

The survey associated the geotechnical engineering and the sedimentary geology of the late Pleistocene–Holocene deposits at five sites and also undifferentiated Pleistocene sediments. A cross-section which was rebuilt in the delta progradation-direction and between the Mekong and Bassac rivers represents the stratigraphy. Each sedimentary unit was formed under a different delta formation mechanism and revealed a typical geotechnical property sequence. The mechanical behaviors of the sediment succession in the tide-dominated delta with significant fluvial-activity and material source tend to be more cohesionless soils and strengths than those in the tide- and wave-dominated delta and even the coast. The particular tendency of the mechanical behavior of the deposit succession can be reasonably estimated from the delta formation mechanism. The characteristics of the clay minerals from the Mekong River produced the argillaceous soil which does not have extremely high plasticity. The microstructure development-levels are low to very high indicating how to choose hydraulic conductivity value, k, for estimating overconsolidation ratio, OCR, by the piezocone penetration tests (CPTU). The OCR of sediments in the delta types strangely change with depth but none less than 1. The post-depositional processes significantly influenced the microstructure development, particularly the dehydrating and oxidizing processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geology","","","","","Proceedings of the International Symposium on Soil Sampling, (1979); Principles of Geotechnical Engineering, (1990); Burland, John, On the compressibility and shear strength of natural clays, Geotechnique, 40, 3, pp. 329-378, (1990); Manual of Soil Laboratory Testing, (1992); Permeability Shear Strength and Compressibility Tests, (1985); Petrography to Petrogenesis, (1995); Jgs 0412 Laboratory Soil Testing Methods, (2000); Cone Penetration Testing in Geotechnical Practice, (1997); Proc Intn Workshop of Hanoi Geoengineering 2003 and 2004, (2003); Fundamentals of Soil Behaviour, (1993)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","24058440","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006264043"

Methods: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to examine the association of WPT with GC risk among Vietnamese men, in Hanoi city, during the period of 2003-2011. Newly-diagnosed GC cases (n = 454) and control patients (n = 628) were matched by age (+/- 5 years) and the year of hospitalization. Information on smoking and alcohol drinking habits and diet including salty food intake and fruits/vegetables consumption were obtained by the interview. Maximum likelihood estimates of odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Cis) were obtained using conditional logistic regression models. Results: The group with the highest consumption of citrus fruits showed a significantly low GC risk (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.4-0.8, P for trend = 0.002). However, there was no association of raw vegetable consumption with GC risk. Referring to never smokers, GC risk was significantly higher in current WPT smokers (OR = 1.8, 95%CI = 1.3-2.4), and it was more evident in exclusively WPT smokers (OR = 2.7, 95%CI = 1.2-6.5). GC risk tended to be higher with daily frequency and longer duration of WPT smoking but these trends were not statistically significant (P for trend: 0.144 and 0.154, respectively). GC risk of those who started smoking WPT before the age of 25 was also significantly high (OR = 3.7, 95%CI = 1.2-11.3). Neither cigarette smoking nor alcohol drinking was related to GC risk. Conclusion: The present findings revealed that WPT smoking was positively associated with GC risk in Vietnamese men. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Age; Aged; Article; Cancer Diagnosis; Cancer Risk; Controlled Study; Disease Association; Drinking Behavior; Food Intake; Fruit; Hospital Based Case Control Study; Human; Male; Men's Health; Salt Intake; Smoking; Stomach Cancer; Vegetable; Very Elderly; Vietnamese; Waterpipe Tobacco Smoking; Adverse Effects; Case Control Study; Citrus; Epidemiology; Healthy Diet; Metabolism; Middle Aged; Pathology; Protection; Risk Factor; Socioeconomics; Statistical Model; Stomach; Stomach Neoplasms; Viet Nam; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Case-control Studies; Fruit; Healthy Diet; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male; Middle Aged; Protective Factors; Risk Factors; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Stomach; Vegetables; Vietnam","adult; age; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer risk; controlled study; disease association; drinking behavior; food intake; fruit; hospital based case control study; human; male; men's health; salt intake; smoking; stomach cancer; vegetable; very elderly; Vietnamese; waterpipe tobacco smoking; adverse effects; case control study; Citrus; epidemiology; healthy diet; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; protection; risk factor; socioeconomics; statistical model; stomach; Stomach Neoplasms; Viet Nam; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Case-Control Studies; Fruit; Healthy Diet; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male; Middle Aged; Protective Factors; Risk Factors; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Stomach; Vegetables; Vietnam","","","The present study was supported by Grants-in-Aids for Scientific Research of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan and Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam.

A subtype H5N8 (clade 2.3.4.4) virus, following an outbreak in poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread worldwide in 2014-2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological investigations, waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that long-distance migratory birds can play a major role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4 virus was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants with multiple neuraminidase subtypes.

However, in the lower-energy terahertz (THz) region, sensing by detecting molecular vibrations is still challenging because of low sensitivity, complicated spectral features, and relatively little accumulated knowledge of molecules. Here, we report the use of a micron-scale thin-slab metamaterial (MM) architecture, which functions as an amplifier for enhancing the absorption signal of the THz vibration of an ultrathin adsorbed layer of large organic molecules. We examined bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a prototype large protein molecule and Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) and 3,3′-diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DTTCI) as examples of small molecules. Among them, our MM significantly magnified only the signal strength of bulky BSA. On the other hand, DTTCI and Rh6G are inactive, as they lack low-frequency vibrational modes in this frequency region. The results obtained here clearly demonstrate the promise of MM-enhanced absorption spectroscopy in the THz region for detection and structural monitoring of large biomolecules such as proteins or pathogenic enzymes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Rhodamine 6g; Silicon; Silver; 3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine; Benzothiazoles; Carbocyanines; Proteins; Rhodamine 6g; Rhodamines; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Silicon; Silver; 3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine; Benzothiazole Derivative; Bovine Serum Albumin; Carbocyanine; Protein; Rhodamine; Rhodamine 6g; Silicon; Silver; Chemistry; Devices; Procedures; Terahertz Spectroscopy; Vibration; Benzothiazoles; Carbocyanines; Proteins; Rhodamines; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Silicon; Silver; Terahertz Spectroscopy; Vibration","3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine; benzothiazole derivative; bovine serum albumin; carbocyanine; protein; rhodamine; rhodamine 6G; silicon; silver; chemistry; devices; procedures; terahertz spectroscopy; vibration; Benzothiazoles; Carbocyanines; Proteins; Rhodamines; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Silicon; Silver; Terahertz Spectroscopy; Vibration","","protein, 67254-75-5; rhodamine 6G, 989-38-8; silicon, 7440-21-3; silver, 7440-22-4; 3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine; Benzothiazoles; Carbocyanines; Proteins; rhodamine 6G; Rhodamines; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Silicon; Silver","The authors at IMS-VAST acknowledge the financial support of projects VAST03.03/15-16 and VAST03.02/15- 16, which were sponsored by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam.

To elucidate the mechanisms involved in nodule acclimation to low Pi availability, two Mesorhizobium-chickpea associations exhibiting differential symbiotic performances, Mesorhizobium ciceri CP-31 (McCP-31)-chickpea and Mesorhizobium mediterranum SWRI9 (MmSWRI9)-chickpea, were comprehensively studied under both control and low Pi conditions. MmSWRI9-chickpea showed a lower symbiotic efficiency under low Pi availability than McCP-31-chickpea as evidenced by reduced growth parameters and down-regulation of nifD and nifK. These differences can be attributed to decline in Pi level in MmSWRI9-induced nodules under low Pi stress, which coincided with up-regulation of several key Pi starvation-responsive genes, and accumulation of asparagine in nodules and the levels of identified amino acids in Pi-deficient leaves of MmSWRI9-inoculated plants exceeding the shoot nitrogen requirement during Pi starvation, indicative of nitrogen feedback inhibition. Conversely, Pi levels increased in nodules of Pi-stressed McCP-31-inoculated plants, because these plants evolved various metabolic and biochemical strategies to maintain nodular Pi homeostasis under Pi deficiency. These adaptations involve the activation of alternative pathways of carbon metabolism, enhanced production and exudation of organic acids from roots into the rhizosphere, and the ability to protect nodule metabolism against Pi deficiency-induced oxidative stress. Collectively, the adaptation of symbiotic efficiency under Pi deficiency resulted from highly coordinated processes with an extensive reprogramming of whole-plant metabolism. The findings of this study will enable us to design effective breeding and genetic engineering strategies to enhance symbiotic efficiency in legume crops. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon And Nitrogen Metabolism;

Nineteen of 39 isolates were found to be proteolytic, of which 7 strains could directly suppress the sporangium formation of Sclerospora graminicola, the pearl millet downy mildew pathogen. Thus, mycelial suspensions containing either spores or cell-free extract of these 7 isolates were used for seed-coating and-soaking treatments to test for their induction of downy mildew resistance. Results indicated that seed-coating overall provided better protection to downy mildew than seed-soaking. In both treatments, the tested isolates demonstrated differential abilities in downy mildew disease protection, with Streptomyces griseus SJ-UOM-07-09 and Streptosporangium roseum SJ-UOM-18-09 showing the highest protection rates. Additionally, the levels of disease protection conferred by the actinomycetes were just slightly lower than that of the systemic fungicide Apron, suggesting their effectiveness. Further studies revealed that the more rapid root colonization by SJ-UOM-18-09 resulted in faster and higher induced resistance in comparison with SJ-UOM-07-09 under greenhouse conditions, indicating that SJ-UOM-18-09 was superior than SJ-UOM-07-09 in inducing resistance. Results from this study provide comprehensive information on biocontrol functions of SJ-UOM-18-09 with great potential to control downy mildew disease in pearl millet. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Fungal; Dna, Ribosomal; Fungicides, Industrial; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Fungal Dna; Fungicide; Ribosome Dna; Rna 16s; Actinobacteria; Classification; Disease Resistance; Drug Effects; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Pennisetum; Peronospora; Physiology; Plant Disease; Plant Seed; Prevention And Control; Protein Degradation; Disease Resistance; Dna, Fungal; Dna, Ribosomal; Fungicides, Industrial; Plant Diseases; Proteolysis; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Seeds","fungal DNA; fungicide; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; Actinobacteria; classification; disease resistance; drug effects; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; microbiology; Pennisetum; Peronospora; physiology; plant disease; plant seed; prevention and control; protein degradation; Disease Resistance; DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal; Fungicides, Industrial; Plant Diseases; Proteolysis; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seeds","","DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal; Fungicides, Industrial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S","","Zhu, Hua, Eliciting antibiotics active against the ESKAPE pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils, Microbiology (United Kingdom), 160, PART 8, pp. 1714-1726, (2014); Open Access Scientific Reports, (2012); Gopalakrishnan, Subramaniam, Plant growth-promoting activities of Streptomyces spp. in sorghum and rice, SpringerPlus, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2013); Gopalakrishnan, Subramaniam, Evaluation of Streptomyces strains isolated from herbal vermicompost for their plant growth-promotion traits in rice, Microbiological Research, 169, 1, pp. 40-48, (2014); Kurth, Florence, Streptomyces-induced resistance against oak powdery mildew involves host plant responses in defense, photosynthesis, and secondary metabolism pathways, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 27, 9, pp. 891-900, (2014); Cao, Lixiang, Isolation and characterization of endophytic Streptomyces strains from surface-sterilized tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) roots, Letters in Applied Microbiology, 39, 5, pp. 425-430, (2004); Bacteria in Agrobiology Plant Growth Responses, (2011); Vêtrovský, Tomáš, Potential of cometabolic transformation of polysaccharides and lignin in lignocellulose by soil Actinobacteria, PLOS ONE, 9, 2, (2014); Lu, Lunhui, Diversity of two-domain laccase-like multicopper oxidase genes in Streptomyces spp.: Identification of genes potentially involved in extracellular activities and lignocellulose degradation during composting of agricultural waste, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 80, 11, pp. 3305-3314, (2014); J Gen Plant Pathol, (2002)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","27499196","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981250458"

Despite its rarity, in 2012 seven individuals of S. cubanus were captured and sampled successfully for DNA analysis, providing new insights into the evolutionary origin of this species and into the origins of the Caribbean fauna, which remain controversial. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of five nuclear genes (Apob, Atp7a, Bdnf, Brca1 and Rag1; total, 4,602 bp) from 35 species of the mammalian order Eulipotyphla. Based on Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses, the family Solenodontidae diverged from other eulipotyphlan in the Paleocene, after the bolide impact on the Yucatan Peninsula, and S. cubanus diverged from the Hispaniolan solenodon (S. paradoxus) in the Early Pliocene. The strikingly recent divergence time estimates suggest that S. cubanus and its ancestral lineage originated via over-water dispersal rather than vicariance events, as had previously been hypothesised. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nuclear Proteins; Nuclear Protein; Animal; Cuba; Genetics; Insectivora; Molecular Evolution; Phylogeny; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Nuclear Proteins; Phylogeny","nuclear protein; animal; Cuba; genetics; Insectivora; molecular evolution; phylogeny; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Nuclear Proteins; Phylogeny","","Nuclear Proteins","","Biogeography of the West Indies Patterns and Perspectives, (2001); Ricklefs, Robert Eric, The West Indies as a laboratory of biogeography and evolution, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 363, 1502, pp. 2393-2413, (2008); Hedges, Stephen Blair, Vicariance and dispersal in Caribbean biogeography, Herpetologica, 52, 3, pp. 466-473, (1996); Hedges, Stephen Blair, Historical biogeography of West Indian vertebrates, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 27, pp. 163-196, (1996); Hedges, Stephen Blair, Biogeography of the west indies: An overview, pp. 15-33, (2001); Hedges, Stephen Blair, Paleogeography of the Antilles and origin of West Indian terrestrial vertebrates, Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 93, 2, pp. 231-244, (2006); Iturralde-Vinent, Manuel Antonio, Paleogeography of the Caribbean region: Implications for cenozoic biogeography, Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 238, pp. 1-72, (1999); Tropics, (2000); Dávalos, Liliana M., Phylogeny and biogeography of Caribbean mammals, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 81, 3, pp. 373-394, (2004); Ali, Jason R., Colonizing the Caribbean: Is the GAARlandia land-bridge hypothesis gaining a foothold?, Journal of Biogeography, 39, 3, pp. 431-433, (2012)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","27498968","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981250046"

However, concerns for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-related nephrotoxicity persist with increased use. Methods: We investigated serum creatinine (S-Cr) monitoring rates before and during ART and the incidence and prevalence of renal dysfunction after starting TDF by using data from a regional cohort of HIV-infected individuals in the Asia-Pacific. Time to renal dysfunction was defined as time from TDF initiation to the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to <60 ml/min/1.73m2 with >30% reduction from baseline using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation or the decision to stop TDF for reported TDF-nephrotoxicity. Predictors of S-Cr monitoring rates were assessed by Poisson regression and risk factors for developing renal dysfunction were assessed by Cox regression. Results: Among 2,425 patients who received TDF, S-Cr monitoring rates increased from 1.01 to 1.84 per person per year after starting TDF (incidence rate ratio 1.68, 95%CI 1.62-1.74, p <0.001). Renal dysfunction on TDF occurred in 103 patients over 5,368 person-years of TDF use (4.2%; incidence 1.75 per 100 person-years). Risk factors for developing renal dysfunction included older age (>50 vs. ≤30, hazard ratio [HR] 5.39, 95%CI 2.52-11.50, p <0.001; and using PI-based regimen (HR 1.93, 95%CI 1.22-3.07, p = 0.005). Having an eGFR prior to TDF (pre-TDF eGFR) of ≥60 ml/min/1.73m2 showed a protective effect (HR 0.38, 95%CI, 0.17-0.85, p = 0.018). Conclusions: Renal dysfunction on commencing TDF use was not common, however, older age, lower baseline eGFR and PI-based ART were associated with higher risk of renal dysfunction during TDF use in adult HIV-infected individuals in the Asia-Pacific region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Creatinine; Proteinase Inhibitor; Tenofovir; Anti-hiv Agents; Creatinine; Tenofovir; Creatinine; Proteinase Inhibitor; Tenofovir; Anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus Agent; Adult; Aging; Article; Asia; Cohort Analysis; Creatinine Blood Level; Drug Efficacy; Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate; Female; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Incidence; Kidney Dysfunction; Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Aged; Pacific Islands; Prevalence; Proportional Hazards Model; Renal Protection; Risk Factor; Blood; Chemically Induced; Drug Effects; Factual Database; Glomerulus Filtration Rate; Hiv Infections; Kidney; Kidney Disease; Pathophysiology; Poisson Distribution; Prospective Study; Adult; Anti-hiv Agents; Creatinine; Databases, Factual; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Poisson Distribution; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tenofovir","creatinine; proteinase inhibitor; tenofovir; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; aging; Article; Asia; cohort analysis; creatinine blood level; drug efficacy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; kidney dysfunction; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Pacific islands; prevalence; proportional hazards model; renal protection; risk factor; blood; chemically induced; drug effects; factual database; glomerulus filtration rate; HIV Infections; kidney; kidney disease; pathophysiology; Poisson distribution; prospective study; Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Creatinine; Databases, Factual; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Poisson Distribution; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tenofovir","","creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; tenofovir, 147127-19-3, 147127-20-6; Anti-HIV Agents; Creatinine; Tenofovir","","Levey, Andrew S., Chronic kidney disease as a global public health problem: Approaches and initiatives - A position statement from Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, Kidney International, 72, 3, pp. 247-259, (2007); Palella, Frank Joseph, Mortality in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era: Changing causes of death and disease in the HIV outpatient study, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (1999), 43, 1, pp. 27-34, (2006); Islam, Fakhrul M., Relative risk of renal disease among people living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis., BMC Public Health, 12, (2012); Mocroft, Amanda J., Chronic renal failure among HIV-1-infected patients, AIDS, 21, 9, pp. 1119-1127, (2007); Ryom, Lene, Association between antiretroviral exposure and renal impairment among HIV-positive persons with normal baseline renal function: The D:A:D Study a, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 207, 9, pp. 1359-1369, (2013); Laprise, Claudie, Association between tenofovir exposure and reduced kidney function in a cohort of HIV-positive patients: Results from 10 years of follow-up, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 56, 4, pp. 567-575, (2013); Cooper, Ryan D., Systematic review and meta-analysis: Renal safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in hiv-infected patients, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 51, 5, pp. 496-505, (2010); Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV 1 Infected Adults and Adolescents; European AIDS Clinical Society Eacs Guidelines for the Clinical Management and Treatment of HIV Infected Adults, (2014); Consolidated Guidelines on the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Preventing HIV Infection Recommendations for A Public Health Approach, (2013)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","27560968","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990036805"

While the extent of global warming may be reduced by a shift towards energy generation by large dams in order to reduce fossil-fuel use, such dams profoundly modify riverine habitats. Furthermore, the threats posed by dams and global warming will interact: for example, dams constrain range adjustments by fishes that might compensate for warming temperatures. Evaluation of their combined or synergistic effects is thus essential for adequate assessment of the consequences of planned water-resource developments. We made projections of the responses of 363 fish species within the Indo-Burma global biodiversity hotspot to the separate and joint impacts of dams and global warming. The hotspot encompasses the Lower Mekong Basin, which is the world's largest freshwater capture fishery. Projections for 81 dam-building scenarios revealed progressive impacts upon projected species richness, habitable area, and the proportion of threatened species as generating capacity increased. Projections from 126 global-warming scenarios included a rise in species richness, a reduction in habitable area, and an increase in the proportion of threatened species; however, there was substantial variation in the extent of these changes among warming projections. Projections from scenarios that combined the effects of dams and global warming were derived either by simply adding the two threats, or by combining them in a synergistic manner that took account of the likelihood that habitat shifts under global warming would be constrained by river fragmentation. Impacts on fish diversity under the synergistic projections were 10-20% higher than those attributable to additive scenarios, and were exacerbated as generating capacity increased-particularly if CO<inf>2</inf> emissions remained high. The impacts of dams, especially those on river mainstreams, are likely to be greater, more predictable and more immediately pressing for fishes than the consequences of global warming. Limits upon dam construction should therefore be a priority action for conserving fish biodiversity in the Indo-Burma hotspot. This would minimize synergistic impacts attributable to dams plus global warming, and help ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services represented by the Lower Mekong fishery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fresh Water; Article; Biodiversity; Carbon Footprint; Concentration (parameters); Dam (barrier); Environmental Change; Environmental Impact; Fish; Geographic Distribution; Greenhouse Effect; Nonhuman; River; Species Diversity; Species Habitat; Species Richness; Algorithm; Animal; Computer Simulation; Electric Power Plant; Environmental Protection; Fishery; Southeast Asia; Algorithms; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Biodiversity; Computer Simulation; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Fishes; Fresh Water; Global Warming; Power Plants; Rivers","fresh water; Article; biodiversity; carbon footprint; concentration (parameters); dam (barrier); environmental change; environmental impact; fish; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; river; species diversity; species habitat; species richness; algorithm; animal; computer simulation; electric power plant; environmental protection; fishery; Southeast Asia; Algorithms; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Biodiversity; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Fishes; Fresh Water; Global Warming; Power Plants; Rivers","","","We thank S.

This study aimed to determine incidence of age-, sex- and subtype-specific firstever stroke (FES) in Vietnam. Methods We conducted a hospital-based retrospective study, targeting all stroke cases hospitalized at a solo-provider hospital in our study site of Nha Trang from January 2009 to December 2011 with International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes I60-69. We calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) of each ICD-10-coded stroke by conducting a detailed case review of 190 randomly selected admissions with ICD-10 codes of I60-I69. These PPVs were then used to estimate annual incident stroke cases from the computerized database. National census data in 2009 was used as a denominator. Results 2,693 eligible admissions were recorded during the study period. The crude annual incidence rate of total FES was 90.2 per 100,000 population (95% CI 81.1-100.2). The ageadjusted incidence of FES was 115.7 (95% CI 95.9-139.1) when adjusted to the WHO world populations. Importantly, age-adjusted intracerebral hemorrhage was as much as one third of total FES: 36.9 (95% CI 26.1-51.0). Conclusions We found a considerable proportion of FES in Vietnam to be attributable to intracerebral hemorrhage, which is as high or exceeding levels seen in high-income countries. A high prevalence of improperly treated hypertension in Vietnam may underlie the high prevalence of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke in this population. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Article; Brain Hemorrhage; Brain Ischemia; Cerebrovascular Accident; Clinical Feature; Controlled Study; Disease Classification; Female; Hospital Admission; Hospitalization; Human; Hypertension; Icd-10; Incidence; Major Clinical Study; Male; Population Distribution; Predictive Value; Retrospective Study; Sex Difference; Very Elderly; Viet Nam; Age; Stroke; Age Factors; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Vietnam","adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; controlled study; disease classification; female; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; hypertension; ICD-10; incidence; major clinical study; male; population distribution; predictive value; retrospective study; sex difference; very elderly; Viet Nam; age; Stroke; Age Factors; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Vietnam","","","","Lozano, Rafael, Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, The Lancet, 380, 9859, pp. 2095-2128, (2012); Murray, Christopher J.L., Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990-2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, The Lancet, 380, 9859, pp. 2197-2223, (2012); Krishnamurthi, Rita V., Global and regional burden of first-ever ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke during 1990-2010: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, The Lancet Global Health, 1, 5, pp. e259-e281, (2013); Feigin, Valery L., Worldwide stroke incidence and early case fatality reported in 56 population-based studies: a systematic review, The Lancet Neurology, 8, 4, pp. 355-369, (2009); Corso, Giovanni, Community-based study of stroke incidence in the Valley of Aosta, Italy - CARe-cerebrovascular aosta registry: Years 2004-2005, Neuroepidemiology, 32, 3, pp. 186-195, (2009); Corbin, David Orlando Christopher, Incidence and case fatality rates of first-ever stroke in a Black Caribbean population: The Barbados register of strokes, Stroke, 35, 6, pp. 1254-1258, (2004); Rothwell, Peter M., Change in stroke incidence, mortality, case-fatality, severity, and risk factors in Oxfordshire, UK from 1981 to 2004 (Oxford Vascular Study), The Lancet, 363, 9425, pp. 1925-1933, (2004); Feigin, Valery L., Ethnic disparities in incidence of stroke subtypes: Auckland Regional Community Stroke Study, 2002-2003, The Lancet Neurology, 5, 2, pp. 130-139, (2006); Anderson, Craig S., Trends in stroke incidence in Auckland, New Zealand, during 1981 to 2003, Stroke, 36, 10, pp. 2087-2093, (2005); Lavados Germain, Pablo M., Incidence, 30-day case-fatality rate, and prognosis of stroke in Iquique, Chile: A 2-year community-based prospective study (PISCIS project), The Lancet, 365, 9478, pp. 2206-2215, (2005)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","27513471","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983475347"

To investigate the clinical relevance of RSV-A ON1,acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases enrolled to our population-based prospective pediatric ARI surveillance at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Central Vietnam from January 2010 through December 2012 were studied. Clinical-epidemiological information and nasopharyngeal samples were collected. Multiplex PCR assays were performed for screening 13 respiratory viruses. RSV-positive samples were further tested for subgroups (A/B) and genotypes information by sequencing the G-glycoprotein 2nd hypervariable region. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of RSV-A ON1. A total of 1854 ARI cases were enrolled and 426 (23.0%) of them were RSV-positive. During the study period, RSV-A and B had been co-circulating. NA1 was the predominant RSV-A genotype until the appearance of ON1 in 2012. RSV-related ARI hospitalization incidence significantly increased after the emergence of ON1. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that risk of lower respiratory tract infection was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.37-3.72) times, and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.01-3.87) times greater in ON1 compared to NA1 cases. Our result suggested that ON1 ARI cases were clinically more severe than NA1. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Genetics; Genotype; Human; Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus; Infant; Male; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Preschool Child; Procedures; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection; Viet Nam; Virology; Virus Pneumonia; Child, Preschool; Genotype; Humans; Infant; Male; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Vietnam","clinical trial; comparative study; genetics; genotype; human; Human respiratory syncytial virus; infant; male; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; procedures; respiratory syncytial virus infection; Viet Nam; virology; virus pneumonia; Child, Preschool; Genotype; Humans; Infant; Male; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Vietnam","","","","Peret, Teresa C.T., Circulation patterns of genetically distinct group A and B strains of human respiratory syncytial virus in a community, Journal of General Virology, 79, 9, pp. 2221-2229, (1998); Van Woensel, Job B.M., Viral lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, BMJ, 327, 7405, pp. 36-40, (2003); Nair, Harish, Global burden of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis, The Lancet, 375, 9725, pp. 1545-1555, (2010); Yoshida, Lay Myint, Viral pathogens associated with acute respiratory infections in central vietnamese children, Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, 29, 1, pp. 75-77, (2010); Simoẽs, Eric A.F., Respiratory syncytial virus infection, The Lancet, 354, 9181, pp. 847-852, (1999); Tregoning, John Simmons, Respiratory viral infections in infants: Causes, clinical symptoms, virology, and immunology, Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 23, 1, pp. 74-98, (2010); Okiro, Emelda Aluoch, Factors associated with increased risk of progression to respiratory syncytial virus-associated pneumonia in young Kenyan children, Tropical Medicine and International Health, 13, 7, pp. 914-926, (2008); Simoẽs, Eric A.F., Environmental and demographic risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract disease, Journal of Pediatrics, 143, 5 SUPPL., pp. S118-S126, (2003); Hall, Caroline Breese, The Burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children, New England Journal of Medicine, 360, 6, pp. 588-598, (2009); Mufson, Maurice A., Two distinct subtypes of human respiratory syncytial virus, Journal of General Virology, 66, 10, pp. 2111-2124, (1985)","","Nature Publishing Group Houndmills Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS","","","","","","20452322","","","27306333","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975155668"

The arr1,10,12 triple mutant showed a significant increase in drought tolerance versus WT plants, as indicated by its higher relative water content and survival rate on drying soil. This enhanced drought tolerance of arr1,10,12 plants can be attributed to enhanced cell membrane integrity, increased anthocyanin biosynthesis, abscisic acid (ABA) hypersensitivity, and reduced stomatal aperture, but not to altered stomatal density. Further drought-tolerance tests of lower-order double and single mutants indicated that ARR1, ARR10, and ARR12 negatively and redundantly control plant responses to drought, with ARR1 appearing to bear the most critical function among the three proteins. In agreement with these findings, a comparative genome-wide analysis of the leaves of arr1,10,12 and WT plants under both normal and dehydration conditions suggested a cytokinin (CK) signaling-mediated network controlling plant adaptation to drought via many dehydration/droughtand/ or ABA-responsive genes that can provide osmotic adjustment and protection to cellular and membrane structures. Expression of all three ARR genes was repressed by dehydration and ABA treatments, inferring that plants down-regulate these genes as an adaptivemechanism to survive drought. Collectively, our results demonstrate that repression of CK response, and thus CK signaling, is one of the strategies plants use to cope with water deficit, providing novel insight for the design of drought-tolerant plants by genetic engineering. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abscisic Acid; Abscisic Acid; Anthocyanins; Arabidopsis Proteins; Arr1 Protein, Arabidopsis; Arr10 Protein, Arabidopsis; Arr12 Protein, Arabidopsis; Cytokinins; Dna-binding Proteins; Transcription Factors; Abscisic Acid; Anthocyanin; Arabidopsis Protein; Arr10 Protein; Arr12 Protein; Beta Arrestin 1; Cytokinin; Unclassified Drug; Vegetable Protein; Arr1 Protein, Arabidopsis; Arr10 Protein, Arabidopsis; Arr12 Protein, Arabidopsis; Dna Binding Protein; Transcription Factor; Transcriptome; Arabidopsis; Article; Cell Membrane; Comparative Study; Down Regulation; Drought; Drought Tolerance; Gene Expression; Genetic Engineering; Hypersensitivity; Nonhuman; Plant Gene; Plant Response; Plant Water Content; Priority Journal; Protein Expression; Protein Function; Signal Transduction; Survival Rate; Adaptation; Biosynthesis; Deficiency; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Mutation; Physiology; Plant Leaf; Plant Stoma; Shoot; Ultrastructure; Abscisic Acid; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthocyanins; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Membrane; Cytokinins; Dna-binding Proteins; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Mutation; Plant Leaves; Plant Shoots; Plant Stomata; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome","abscisic acid; anthocyanin; Arabidopsis protein; arr10 protein; arr12 protein; beta arrestin 1; cytokinin; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; ARR1 protein, Arabidopsis; ARR10 protein, Arabidopsis; ARR12 protein, Arabidopsis; DNA binding protein; transcription factor; transcriptome; Arabidopsis; Article; cell membrane; comparative study; down regulation; drought; drought tolerance; gene expression; genetic engineering; hypersensitivity; nonhuman; plant gene; plant response; plant water content; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; signal transduction; survival rate; adaptation; biosynthesis; deficiency; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; physiology; plant leaf; plant stoma; shoot; ultrastructure; Abscisic Acid; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthocyanins; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Membrane; Cytokinins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Mutation; Plant Leaves; Plant Shoots; Plant Stomata; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome","","abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; Abscisic Acid; Anthocyanins; Arabidopsis Proteins; ARR1 protein, Arabidopsis; ARR10 protein, Arabidopsis; ARR12 protein, Arabidopsis; Cytokinins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Transcription Factors","","Peleg, Zvi, Hormone balance and abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 14, 3, pp. 290-295, (2011); Zwack, Paul J., Interactions between cytokinin signalling and abiotic stress responses, Journal of Experimental Botany, 66, 16, pp. 4863-4871, (2015); Fujita, Yasunari, ABA-mediated transcriptional regulation in response to osmotic stress in plants, Journal of Plant Research, 124, 4, pp. 509-525, (2011); Nishiyama, Rie, Analysis of cytokinin mutants and regulation of cytokinin metabolic genes reveals important regulatory roles of cytokinins in drought, salt and abscisic acid responses, and abscisic acid biosynthesis, Plant Cell, 23, 6, pp. 2169-2183, (2011); Hwang, Ildoo, Cytokinin signaling networks, Annual Review of Plant Biology, 63, pp. 353-380, (2012); Werner, Tomáš, Root-specific reduction of cytokinin causes enhanced root growth, drought tolerance, and leaf mineral enrichment in Arabidopsis and tobacco, Plant Cell, 22, 12, pp. 3905-3920, (2010); Ha, Sukbong, Cytokinins: Metabolism and function in plant adaptation to environmental stresses, Trends in Plant Science, 17, 3, pp. 172-179, (2012); Arabidopsis Book, (2014); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Functional analysis of AHK1/ATHK1 and cytokinin receptor histidine kinases in response to abscisic acid, drought, and salt stress in Arabidopsis, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, 51, pp. 20623-20628, (2007); Kang, Na-young, Cytokinin receptor-dependent and receptor-independent pathways in the dehydration response of Arabidopsis thaliana, Journal of Plant Physiology, 169, 14, pp. 1382-1391, (2012)","","National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","26884175","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962497225"

Methods HIV-infected adults in two large hospitals in urban Hanoi were enrolled to the prospective cohort, from October 2007 through December 2013. Those who started ART less than one year before enrollment were assigned to the survival analysis. Data on ART history and ADIs were collected retrospectively at enrollment and followed-up prospectively until April 2014. Results Of 2,070 cohort participants, 1,197 were eligible for analysis and provided 3,446 personyears (PYs) of being on ART. Overall, 161 ADIs episodes were noted at a median of 3.20 months after ART initiation (range 0.0375.8) with an incidence 46.7/1,000 PYs (95% confidence interval [CI] 39.854.5). The most common ADI was tuberculosis with an incidence of 29.9/1,000 PYs. Mortality after ART initiation was 8.68/1,000 PYs and 45% (19/45) died of AIDS-related illnesses. Age over 50 years at ART initiation was significantly associated with shorter survival after controlling for baseline CD4 count, but neither having injection drug use (IDU) history nor previous ADIs were associated with poor survival. Semi-competing risks analysis in 951 patients without ADIs history prior to ART showed those who developed ADIs after starting ART were at higher risk of death in the first six months than after six months. Conclusion ADIs were not rare in spite of being on effective ART. Age over 50 years, but not IDU history, was associated with shorter survival in the cohort.

Methods Patients testing HBs antigen (Ag) or HCV antibody (Ab) positive within enrollment into TAHOD were considered HBV or HCV co-infected. Factors associated with HBV and/orHCV co-infection were assessed by logistic regression models. Factors associated with post-ART HIV immunological response (CD4 change after six months) and virological response (HIV RNA <400 copies/ml after 12 months) were also determined. Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Results A total of 7,455 subjects were recruited by December 2012. Of patients tested, 591/5656 (10.4%) were HBsAg positive, 794/5215 (15.2%) were HCVAb positive, and 88/4966 (1.8%) were positive for both markers. In multivariate analysis, HCV co-infection, age, route of HIV infection, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV RNA, and HIV-1 subtype were associated with immunological recovery. Age, route of HIV infection, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV RNA, ART regimen, prior ART and HIV-1 subtype, but not HBV or HCV co-infection, affected HIV RNA suppression. Risk factors affecting mortality included HCV co-infection, age, CDC stage, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV RNA and prior mono/dual ART. Shortest survival was seen in subjects who were both HBV-and HCV-positive. Conclusion In this Asian cohort of HIV-infected patients, HCV co-infection, but not HBV co-infection, was associated with lower CD4 cell recovery after ART and increased mortality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-retroviral Agents; Cd4 Antigen; Hepatitis B Surface Antigen; Hepatitis C Antibody; Virus Rna; Antiretrovirus Agent; Adult; Age; Article; Asian; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Analysis; Data Base; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Infection Risk; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mixed Infection; Mortality; Outcome Assessment; Overall Survival; Risk Assessment; Survival Time; Virus Load; Virus Transmission; Asia; Clinical Trial; Coinfection; Complication; Drug Effects; Hiv Infections; Isolation And Purification; Middle Aged; Multicenter Study; Risk Factor; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Adult; Anti-retroviral Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Studies; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Hiv-1; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome","CD4 antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis C antibody; virus RNA; antiretrovirus agent; adult; age; Article; Asian; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; data base; female; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; mortality; outcome assessment; overall survival; risk assessment; survival time; virus load; virus transmission; Asia; clinical trial; Coinfection; complication; drug effects; HIV Infections; isolation and purification; middle aged; multicenter study; risk factor; survival analysis; treatment outcome; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Studies; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; HIV-1; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome","","Anti-Retroviral Agents","The TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database is an initiative of TREAT Asia, a program of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, with support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and National Cancer Institute, as part of the International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA; U01AI069907), and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs through a partnership with Stichting Aids Fonds.

In the present study, we analyzed gamma oscillations of pulvinar neurons in the monkeys during a delayed non-matching to sample task, in which monkeys were required to discriminate 4 categories of visual stimuli (snakes, monkey faces, monkey hands and simple geometrical patterns). Gamma oscillations of pulvinar neuronal activity were analyzed in three phases around the stimulus onset (Pre-stimulus: 500 ms before stimulus onset; Early: 0-200 ms after stimulus onset; and Late: 300-500 ms after stimulus onset). The results showed significant increases in mean strength of gamma oscillations in the Early phase for snakes and the Late phase for monkey faces, but no significant differences in ratios and frequencies of gamma oscillations among the 3 phases. The different periods of stronger gamma oscillations provide neurophysiological evidence that is consistent with other studies indicating that primates can detect snakes very rapidly and also cue in to faces for information. Our results are suggestive of different roles of gamma oscillations in the pulvinar: feedforward processing for images of snakes and cortico-pulvinar-cortical integration for images of faces. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal Experiment; Animal Tissue; Haplorhini; Macaca; Nerve Cell; Nonhuman; Oscillation; Pulvinar; Snake; Stimulus; Animal; Electrophysiology; Female; Male; Photostimulation; Physiology; Reaction Time; Vision; Animals; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Female; Male; Neurons; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Visual Perception","animal experiment; animal tissue; Haplorhini; Macaca; nerve cell; nonhuman; oscillation; pulvinar; snake; stimulus; animal; electrophysiology; female; male; photostimulation; physiology; reaction time; vision; Animals; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Female; Male; Neurons; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Visual Perception","","","This research was supported in part by the JSPS Asian Core Program, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (25290005), and the National Bio-Resource Project (NBRP) “Japanese Monkeys” of the MEXT, Japan.

It has been reported that the EAT volume is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, little is known about which phenotypes of COPD are associated with increased EAT. Methods: One hundred and eighty smokers who were referred to the clinic were consecutively enrolled. A chest CT was used for the quantification of the emphysematous lesions, airway lesions, and EAT. These lesions were assessed as the percentage of low attenuation volume (LAV%), the square root of airway wall area of a hypothetical airway with an internal perimeter of 10 mm (√Aaw at Pi10) and the EAT area, respectively. The same measurements were made on 225 Vietnamese COPD patients to replicate the results. Results: Twenty-six of the referred patients did not have COPD, while 105 were diagnosed as having COPD based on a FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC<0.70. The EAT area was significantly associated with age, BMI, FEV<inf>1</inf> (%predicted), FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC, self-reported hypertension, self-reported CVD, statin use, LAV%, and √Aaw at Pi10 in COPD patients. The multiple regression analyses showed that only BMI, self-reported CVD and √Aaw at Pi10 were independently associated with the EAT area (R2 = 0.51, p<0.0001). These results were replicated in the Vietnamese population. Conclusions: The EAT area is independently associated with airway wall thickness. Because EAT is also an independent predictor of CVD risk, these data suggest a mechanistic link between the airway predominant form of COPD and CVD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomarkers; Aquilion One; Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitor; Biological Marker; Adipose Tissue; Age; Aged; Article; Body Mass; Cardiovascular Disease; Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; Computed Tomography Scanner; Computer Assisted Tomography; Controlled Study; Coronary Artery Calcium Score; Epicardial Adipose Tissue; Female; Fev1 Fvc; Forced Expiratory Volume; Forced Vital Capacity; Human; Hypertension; Lung Emphysema; Major Clinical Study; Male; Quantitative Analysis; Smoking; Vietnamese; Adult; Airway Remodeling; Calcinosis; Complication; Coronary Blood Vessel; Disease Course; Lung; Metabolism; Middle Aged; Pathology; Pathophysiology; Pericardium; Phenotype; Regression Analysis; Spirometry; Thorax Radiography; Viet Nam; X-ray Computed Tomography; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Airway Remodeling; Biomarkers; Body Mass Index; Calcinosis; Coronary Vessels; Disease Progression; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Hypertension; Lung; Middle Aged; Pericardium; Phenotype; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Pulmonary Emphysema; Radiography, Thoracic; Regression Analysis; Smoking; Spirometry; Tomography, X-ray Computed; Vietnam","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; biological marker; adipose tissue; age; aged; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronary artery calcium score; epicardial adipose tissue; female; FEV1 FVC; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; hypertension; lung emphysema; major clinical study; male; quantitative analysis; smoking; Vietnamese; adult; airway remodeling; calcinosis; complication; coronary blood vessel; disease course; lung; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; pericardium; phenotype; regression analysis; spirometry; thorax radiography; Viet Nam; x-ray computed tomography; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Airway Remodeling; Biomarkers; Body Mass Index; Calcinosis; Coronary Vessels; Disease Progression; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Hypertension; Lung; Middle Aged; Pericardium; Phenotype; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Pulmonary Emphysema; Radiography, Thoracic; Regression Analysis; Smoking; Spirometry; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vietnam","","Biomarkers","","Celli, Bartolomé R., Sex differences in mortality and clinical expressions of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The TORCH experience, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 183, 3, pp. 317-322, (2011); Soriano, Joan B., Patterns of comorbidities in newly diagnosed COPD and asthma in primary care, Chest, 128, 4, pp. 2099-2107, (2005); Lee, Hwamu, Relation between COPD severity and global cardiovascular risk in US adults, Chest, 142, 5, pp. 1118-1125, (2012); Anthonisen, Nicholas R., The effects of a smoking cessation intervention on 14.5-year mortality: A randomized clinical trial, Annals of Internal Medicine, 142, 4, pp. 233-239, (2005); Calverley, Peter M.A., Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate and survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, New England Journal of Medicine, 356, 8, pp. 775-789, (2007); Ding, Jingzhong, The association of pericardial fat with incident coronary heart disease: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 90, 3, pp. 499-504, (2009); Mahabadi, Amir Abbas, Association of epicardial fat with cardiovascular risk factors and incident myocardial infarction in the general population: The Heinz Nixdorf recall study, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 61, 13, pp. 1388-1395, (2013); Zagaceta, Jorge, Epicardial Adipose Tissue in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, PLOS ONE, 8, 6, (2013); Nakano, Yasutaka, Quantitative assessment of airway remodeling using high-resolution CT, Chest, 122, 6 SUPPL., pp. 271-275, (2002); Nakano, Yasutaka, Computed tomographic measurements of airway dimensions and emphysema in smokers correlation with lung function, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 162, 3 I, pp. 1102-1108, (2000)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","26866482","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959449348"

Design: Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. Setting: Twenty-nine countries from the World Health Organization Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health. Population: 29,647 women with prior caesarean section and no pregnancy complications in their current pregnancy who delivered a term singleton (live birth and stillbirth) at gestational age 37-41 weeks by pre-labour caesarean section, intra-partum caesarean section, or vaginal birth following spontaneous onset of labour. Methods: We compared the rate of short-term adverse maternal and newborn outcomes following pre-labour caesarean section at a given gestational age, to those following ongoing pregnancies beyond that gestational age. Main Outcome Measures Severe maternal outcomes, neonatal morbidity, and intra-hospital early neonatal mortality. Results: Odds of neonatal morbidity and intra-hospital early neonatal mortality were 0.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.60) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.58) times lower for ongoing pregnancies compared to pre-labour caesarean section at 37 weeks. We did not find any significant change in the risk of severe maternal outcomes between pre-labour caesarean section at a given gestational age and ongoing pregnancies beyond that gestational age. Conclusions: Elective repeat caesarean section at 37 weeks had higher risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality compared to ongoing pregnancy, however risks at later gestational ages did not differ between groups. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Cesarean Section; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Delivery; Disease Severity; Female; Gestational Age; Health; Health Survey; Human; Low Risk Patient; Maternal Welfare; Newborn Health; Newborn Morbidity; Newborn Mortality; Pregnant Woman; Risk Assessment; Secondary Analysis; Vaginal Delivery; World Health Organization; Adolescent; Child Health; Clinical Trial; Elective Surgery; Infant; Infant Mortality; Maternal Mortality; Multicenter Study; Newborn; Obstetric Delivery; Odds Ratio; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Procedures; Risk Factor; World Health Organization; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cross-sectional Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant; Infant Health; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health; Maternal Mortality; Odds Ratio; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Risk Factors; Young Adult","adult; Article; cesarean section; controlled study; cross-sectional study; delivery; disease severity; female; gestational age; health; health survey; human; low risk patient; maternal welfare; newborn health; newborn morbidity; newborn mortality; pregnant woman; risk assessment; secondary analysis; vaginal delivery; world health organization; adolescent; child health; clinical trial; elective surgery; infant; infant mortality; maternal mortality; multicenter study; newborn; obstetric delivery; odds ratio; poverty; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; procedures; risk factor; World Health Organization; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant; Infant Health; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health; Maternal Mortality; Odds Ratio; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Risk Factors; Young Adult","","","","Declercq, Eugene Ft, Is a rising cesarean delivery rate inevitable?

Genetic improvement of salt tolerance is essential for sustainable soybean production in saline areas. In this study, we isolated a gene (Ncl) that could synchronously regulate the transport and accumulation of Na+, K+, and Cl- from a Brazilian soybean cultivar FT-Abyara using map-based cloning strategy. Higher expression of the salt tolerance gene Ncl in the root resulted in lower accumulations of Na+, K+, and Cl- in the shoot under salt stress. Transfer of Ncl with the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method into a soybean cultivar Kariyutaka significantly enhanced its salt tolerance. Introgression of the tolerance allele into soybean cultivar Jackson, using DNA marker-assisted selection (MAS), produced an improved salt tolerance line. Ncl could increase soybean grain yield by 3.6-5.5 times in saline field conditions. Using Ncl in soybean breeding through gene transfer or MAS would contribute to sustainable soybean production in saline-prone areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Plant Proteins; Sodium-potassium-chloride Symporters; Plant Protein; Sodium Potassium Chloride Cotransporter; Agrobacterium; Food Grain; Gene Expression; Gene Vector; Genetic Engineering; Genetic Transformation; Genetics; Metabolism; Physiological Stress; Plant Root; Salinity; Salt Tolerance; Soybean; Transgene; Transgenic Plant; Edible Grain; Gene Expression; Genetic Engineering; Genetic Vectors; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Salinity; Salt-tolerance; Sodium-potassium-chloride Symporters; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Transformation, Genetic; Transgenes","plant protein; sodium potassium chloride cotransporter; Agrobacterium; food grain; gene expression; gene vector; genetic engineering; genetic transformation; genetics; metabolism; physiological stress; plant root; salinity; salt tolerance; soybean; transgene; transgenic plant; Edible Grain; Gene Expression; Genetic Engineering; Genetic Vectors; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Salinity; Salt-Tolerance; Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Transformation, Genetic; Transgenes","","Plant Proteins; Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters","We thank Drs.

It, however, becomes impractical when moving away from closed-shell nuclei. Instead, it is the interplay between the macroscopic shape degrees of freedom and the microscopic nature of the underlying single-particle structure in a deformed basis that determines the nuclear structure. Being the heaviest nucleus precisely in the middle of, known, closed proton and neutron shells, 170Dy has become a central calibration point for tests of collective models of nuclear physics. However, besides one candidate transition from a previous experiment in Legnaro, Italy, no experimental information is available for this nucleus. Using the EURICA setup at RIKEN, which couples the worlds highest intensity in-flight fission facility with a high-efficiency HPGe array, an experiment in November 2014 produced 170Dy nuclei by in-flight fission of a 238U beam. The results from this experiment provide a wealth of information on this elusive nucleus, including the evolution of quadrupole collectivity, rigidity and higher order deformations, as well as the long sought for isomeric K = 6+ state, predicted to be exceptionally pure at mid-shell. These results provide us with a rich level scheme for discussing both single-particle and collective structures at mid-shell. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Degrees Of Freedom (mechanics); Germanium Compounds; Calibration Points; Collective Structures; Fission Facilities; Heaviest Nuclei; Macroscopic Shapes; Nuclear Structure; Proton And Neutron; Wealth Of Information; Shells (structures)","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Germanium compounds; Calibration points; Collective structures; Fission facilities; Heaviest nuclei; Macroscopic shapes; Nuclear structure; Proton and neutron; Wealth of information; Shells (structures)","","","","Casten, Richard F., Evidence for an underlying SU(3) structure near neutron number N=104, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 31, 5, pp. 1991-1994, (1985); Dean, D.

In contrast, alternative phenotypes arising from a single genotype are almost exclusively limited to dimorphism in nature. We report a remarkable case of macroevolutionary-scale diversification without genetic divergence. Upon colonizing the island-like microecosystem of individual figs, symbiotic nematodes of the genus Pristionchus accumulated a polyphenism with up to five discrete adult morphotypes per species. By integrating laboratory and field experiments with extensive genotyping of individuals, including the analysis of 49 genomes from a single species, we show that rapid filling of potential ecological niches is possible without diversifying selection on genotypes. This uncoupling of morphological diversification and speciation in fig-associated nematodes has resulted from a remarkable expansion of discontinuous developmental plasticity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diversifying Selections; Ecological Niche; Genetic Divergence; Genotyping; Laboratory And Field Experiments; Morphotypes; Single Species; Animal; Ecology; Evolution; Ficus; Genetics; Genome; Genotype; Nematode; Parasitology; Phylogeny; Reproductive Isolation; Species Differentiation; Symbiosis; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Genetic Speciation; Genome; Genotype; Nematoda; Phylogeny; Reproductive Isolation; Symbiosis","Diversifying selections; Ecological niche; Genetic divergence; Genotyping; Laboratory and field experiments; Morphotypes; Single species; animal; ecology; evolution; Ficus; genetics; genome; genotype; nematode; parasitology; phylogeny; reproductive isolation; species differentiation; symbiosis; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Genetic Speciation; Genome; Genotype; Nematoda; Phylogeny; Reproductive Isolation; Symbiosis","","","","Major Features of Evolution, (1953); Ecology of Adaptive Radiation, (2000); Gavrilets, Sergey, Adaptive radiation: Contrasting theory with data, Science, 323, 5915, pp. 732-737, (2009); Brawand, David, The genomic substrate for adaptive radiation in African cichlid fish, Nature, 513, 7518, pp. 375-381, (2015); Lamichhaney, Sangeet, Evolution of Darwin's finches and their beaks revealed by genome sequencing, Nature, 518, 7539, pp. 371-375, (2015); Developmental Plasticity and Evolution, (2003); Wilson, Edward O., The origin and evolution of polymorphism in ants., Quarterly Review of Biology, 28, 2, pp. 136-156, (1953); Moran, Nancy A., The evolution of aphid life cycles, Annual Review of Entomology, 37, 1, pp. 321-348, (1992); Journal of Crustacean Biology, (1987); Gianoli, Ernesto, Leaf mimicry in a climbing plant protects against herbivory, Current Biology, 24, 9, pp. 984-987, (2014)","","American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","","","23752548","","","26824073","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962187963"

Our previous epidemiological studies showed adverse effects of dioxin exposure on neurodevelopment for the first 3 years of life. Subsequently, we extended the follow-up period and investigated the influence of perinatal dioxin exposure on neurodevelopment, including motor coordination and higher cognitive ability, in preschool children. Presently, we investigated 176 children in a hot spot of dioxin contamination who were followed up from birth until 5 years old. Perinatal dioxin exposure levels were estimated by measuring dioxin levels in maternal breast milk. Dioxin toxicity was evaluated using two indices; toxic equivalent (TEQ)-polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDDs/Fs) and concentration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Coordinated movements, including manual dexterity, aiming and catching, and balance, were assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (Movement ABC-2). Cognitive ability was assessed using the nonverbal index (NVI) of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II). In boys, total test and balance scores of Movement ABC-2 were significantly lower in the high TEQ- PCDDs/Fs group compared with the moderate and low exposure groups. NVI scores and the pattern reasoning subscale of the KABC-II indicating planning ability were also significantly lower in the high TCDD exposure group compared with the low exposure group of boys. However, in girls, no significant differences in Movement ABC-2 and KABC-II scores were found among the different TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and TCDD exposure groups. Furthermore, in high risk cases, five boys and one girl highly exposed to TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and TCDD had double the risk for difficulties in both neurodevelopmental skills. These results suggest differential impacts of TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and TCDD exposure on motor coordination and higher cognitive ability, respectively. Moreover, high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs exposure combined with high TCDD exposure may increase autistic traits combined with developmental coordination disorder. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Dibenzo(1,4)dioxin; Dioxins; Environmental Pollutants; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Dioxin; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxin; Polychlorinated Dibenzofuran; Dibenzo(1,4)dioxin; Pollutant; Article; Body Equilibrium; Breast Milk; Chemical Analysis; Child; Clinical Assessment Tool; Cognitive Development; Concentration (parameters); Controlled Study; Developmental Toxicity; Environmental Exposure; Female; Follow Up; High Risk Population; Human; Kaufman Assessment Battery For Children Second Edition; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mental Capacity; Mental Performance; Motor Coordination; Motor Performance; Movement Assessment Battery For Children Second Edition; Nervous System Development; Neurotoxicity; Nonverbal Index; Perinatal Period; Preschool Child; Scoring System; Toxicity Testing; Vietnamese; Autistic Disorder; Chemically Induced; Chemistry; Cognition; Drug Effects; Fetus; Infant; Intelligence Test; Maternal Exposure; Motor Activity; Motor Skills Disorders; Neuropsychological Test; Newborn; Pathophysiology; Pregnancy; Sex Difference; Toxicity; Viet Nam; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Dioxins; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetus; Follow-up Studies; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intelligence Tests; Male; Maternal Exposure; Milk, Human; Motor Activity; Neuropsychological Tests; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Pregnancy; Sex Factors; Vietnam","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; dibenzo(1,4)dioxin; pollutant; Article; body equilibrium; breast milk; chemical analysis; child; clinical assessment tool; cognitive development; concentration (parameters); controlled study; developmental toxicity; environmental exposure; female; follow up; high risk population; human; Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition; major clinical study; male; mental capacity; mental performance; motor coordination; motor performance; Movement Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition; nervous system development; neurotoxicity; nonverbal index; perinatal period; preschool child; scoring system; toxicity testing; Vietnamese; Autistic Disorder; chemically induced; chemistry; cognition; drug effects; fetus; infant; intelligence test; maternal exposure; motor activity; Motor Skills Disorders; neuropsychological test; newborn; pathophysiology; pregnancy; sex difference; toxicity; Viet Nam; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Dioxins; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetus; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intelligence Tests; Male; Maternal Exposure; Milk, Human; Motor Activity; Neuropsychological Tests; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Pregnancy; Sex Factors; Vietnam","","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin, 1746-01-6; dibenzo(1,4)dioxin; Dioxins; Environmental Pollutants; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins","This work was supported partly by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Asian Core Program and the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (25305024) and (25290005) and Challenging Exploratory Research (15K15244).

In the present study, we observed a high detection rate of PEDV, with 72.5 % (148/204) of diarrhea samples (suckling, weaned, and sows) and 88.5 % (77/87) of farms experiencing acute diarrhea found to be positive for PEDV by reverse transcription PCR. Sequencing and phylogenic analyses of the partial spike gene and ORF3 of PEDV demonstrated that all prevailing Japanese PEDV isolates belonged to novel genotypes that differed from previously reported strains and the two PEDV vaccine strains currently being used in Japan. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed prevailing PEDV isolates in Japan had the greatest genetic similarity to US isolates and were not vaccine-related. Unlike vaccine strains, all prevailing field PEDV isolates in Japan were found to have a number of amino acid differences in the neutralizing epitope domain, COE, which may affect antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. The present study indicates recent PEDV isolates may have been introduced into Japan from overseas and highlights the urgent requirement of novel vaccines for controlling PEDV outbreaks in Japan. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Orf3; Partial S Gene; Ped; Pedv Japan; Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","","","","","Chang, Sunhwa, Identification of the epitope region capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Molecules and Cells, 14, 2, pp. 295-299, (2002); Chen, Jianfei, Molecular epidemiology of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China, Archives of Virology, 155, 9, pp. 1471-1476, (2010); Chen, Xi, Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) samples from field cases in Fujian, China, Virus Genes, 45, 3, pp. 499-507, (2012); Hanke, Dennis, Comparison of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses from germany and the united states, 2014, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 21, 3, pp. 493-496, (2015); Kim, So Y., Differential detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus by duplex RT-PCR, Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation, 13, 6, pp. 516-520, (2001); Kusanagi, Koichi, Isolation and Serial Propagation of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in Cell Cultures and Partial Characterization of the Isolate, Journal of Veterinary Medical Science, 54, 2, pp. 313-318, (1992); Lee, Sunhee, Outbreak-related porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains similar to US strains, South Korea, 2013, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 20, 7, pp. 1223-1226, (2014); Lee, Sunhee, Full-genome sequence analysis of a variant strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in South Korea, Genome Announcements, 2, 6, (2014); Park, Seongjun, Sequence analysis of the partial spike glycoprotein gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses isolated in Korea, Virus Genes, 35, 2, pp. 321-332, (2007); Park, Seongjun, Cloning and further sequence analysis of the ORF3 gene of wild- and attenuated-type porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses, Virus Genes, 36, 1, pp. 95-104, (2008)","","SpringerOpen","","","","","","21931801","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949196474"

Dioxins, which are cancer inducing substances, may transfer from the soil to food crops and finally to human beings living around the area. Many surveys of dioxins in soil, water, organisms, and human have been carried out in this study area since 2002. In this paper vertical distribution of dioxins in undisturbed soil cores were examined. Twelve soil samples from three drilled cores were collected to analyze dioxin levels according to the standard Japanese analytical method. The results showed that the toxicity equivalency quantity (TEQ) in one soil sample at a depth of 2.6 m reached 3,300 pg-TEQ/g-dw. High TEQs were also observed in the clay layer. This anomaly of dioxin concentrations could be attributed to the affinity of dioxins for the clay layer. The isomer patterns in the soils were different from those in the soil of Hokkaido in that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was the most dominant in the soil sample. This indicates that the dioxins originate from a defoliant Agent Orange disposed at the site after the Vietnam War. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bien Hoa Airbase; Dioxins; Dominant Isomer; Soil; Teq; Vertical Distribution","","","","","Altarawneh, Mohammednoor Khalil, Mechanisms for formation, chlorination, dechlorination and destruction of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 35, 3, pp. 245-274, (2009); Bergknut, Magnus, Dioxins, PCBs, and HCB in soil and peat profiles from a pristine boreal catchment, Environmental Pollution, 158, 7, pp. 2518-2525, (2010); Birch, Gavin F., The source and distribution of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorinated dibenzofurans in sediments of Port Jackson, Australia, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 54, 3, pp. 295-308, (2007); Bulle, Cécile S.M., Transport of chlorinated dioxins and furans in soil columns: Modeling pentachlorophenol pole-treating oil influence, Chemosphere, 83, 2, pp. 117-123, (2011); Czuczwa, Jean M., Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in sediments from siskiwit lake, Isle Royale, Science, 226, 4674, pp. 568-569, (1984); Dwernychuk, L.

In Vietnam, the reasons for disengagement from clinics and the effect of injection drug use (IDU) on LTFU with unknown outcome (true LTFU) are not well known. Methods Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) from two HIV clinics in Hanoi were included in this observational study between 2007 and 2012, and followed up every 6 months until the end of 2013. The reasons for disengagement from the clinic, and ART status during imprisonment were investigated in patients with a history of IDU to identify true LTFU. The retention rate at 6-54 months and true LTFU rate were calculated. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to identify factors associated with true LTFU. Results There were 1,431 patients, with a follow-up time of 4,371 person-years (median 2.49 years). At the end of the follow-up period, 71 (5.0%) patients died, 79 (5.5%) transferred to other clinics, 16 (1.1%) disengaged from the clinics, and the calculated true LTFU was 45 (3.1%), with 12-month ART retention rate of 95.3% for the entire study population. Imprisonment was the most frequent reason for disengagement from the clinics. True LTFU correlated significantly with low CD4 count and high plasma viral load, but not history of IDU. Conclusion Imprisonment is a major cause of disengagement from HIV care among patients with a history of IDU. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-hiv Agents; Antiretrovirus Agent; Anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus Agent; Adult; Article; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; Female; Follow Up; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Intravenous Drug Abuse; Major Clinical Study; Male; Medication Compliance; Mortality; Observational Study; Outcome Assessment; Patient Compliance; Patient Transport; Prison; Viet Nam; Virus Load; Adolescent; Aged; Hiv Infections; Middle Aged; Very Elderly; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Anti-hiv Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (health Care); Vietnam; Young Adult","antiretrovirus agent; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; female; follow up; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; intravenous drug abuse; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; mortality; observational study; outcome assessment; patient compliance; patient transport; prison; Viet Nam; virus load; adolescent; aged; HIV Infections; middle aged; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-HIV Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Vietnam; Young Adult","","Anti-HIV Agents","The authors thank Mses Nguyen Thi Huyen, Nguyen Thi Yen, and Keiko Saito for their help and support in data collection.

In this study, we investigated HEV seroprevalence among the general population in the Siem Reap province, Cambodia, and performed HEV genetic analysis with the aim to develop an HEV prevention strategy. This seroepidemiological cross-sectional study conducted from 2010 to 2014 included 868 participants from four different locations in Siem Reap province, Cambodia. They answered questionnaires and provided blood samples for the analysis of hepatitis virus infections. Among the participants (360 men and 508 women; age range, 7-90 years), the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was 18.4% (95% confidence interval: 15.9-21.0); HEV RNA was detected in two participants (0.23%) and was classified as genotype 3 and 4. Fulllength genome of the genotype 4 isolate, CVS-Sie10, was sequenced; it contained 7,222 nucleotides and three ORFs and demonstrated high sequence identity with the swine China isolates swGX40 (95.57%), SS19 (94.37%), and swDQ (91.94%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that men, elderly people, and house workers were risk groups significantly associated with the positivity for anti-HEV IgG. This is the first report on the detection of HEV genotype 4 in humans in Cambodia and on the complete genome sequence of HEV genotype 4 from this country. Our study demonstrates that new HEV infection cases occur frequently among the general population in Cambodia, and effective preventive measures are required.

However, the preparation of decellularized or inactivated skin using HHP has not been reported. The objective of this study was thus to prepare inactivated skin from human skin using HHP, and to explore the appropriate conditions of pressurization to inactivate skin that can be used for skin reconstruction. Human skin samples of 8 mm in diameter were packed in bags filled with normal saline solution (NSS) or distilled water (DW), and then pressurized at 0, 100, 150, 200 and 1000 MPa for 10 minutes. The viability of skin after HHP was evaluated using WST-8 assay. Outgrowth cells from pressurized skin and the viability of pressurized skin after cultivation for 14 days were also evaluated. The pressurized skin was subjected to histological evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemical staining of type IV collagen for the basement membrane of epidermis and capillaries, and immunohistochemical staining of von Willebrand factor (vWF) for capillaries. Then, human cultured epidermis (CE) was applied on the pressurized skin and implanted into the subcutis of nude mice; specimens were subsequently obtained 14 days after implantation. Skin samples pressurized at more than 200 MPa were inactivated in both NSS and DW. The basement membrane and capillaries remained intact in all groups according to histological and immunohistological evaluations, and collagen fibers showed no apparent damage by SEM. CE took on skin pressurized at 150 and 200 MPa after implantation, whereas it did not take on skin pressurized at 1000 MPa. These results indicate that human skin could be inactivated after pressurization at more than 200 MPa, but skin pressurized at 1000 MPa had some damage to the dermis that prevented the taking of CE.

Methods The present study included 53,930 Japanese employees, aged 15 to 83 years, who received health check-up and did not have diabetes at baseline. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dl, random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dl, HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol), or receiving medication for diabetes. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to investigate the association between smoking and the risk of diabetes. Results During 3.9 years of median follow-up, 2,441 (4.5%) individuals developed T2D. The multivariable- Adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for diabetes were 1 (reference), 1.16 (1.04 to 1.30) and 1.34 (1.22 to 1.48) for never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers, respectively. Diabetes risk increased with increasing numbers of cigarette consumption among current smokers (P for trend <0.001). Although the relative risk of diabetes was greater among subjects with lower BMIs (< 23 kg/m2), attributable risk was greater in subjects with higher BMIs (≥ 23 kg/m2). Compared with individuals who had never smoked, former smokers who quit less than 5 years, 5 to 9 years, and 10 years or more exhibited hazards ratios for diabetes of 1.36 (1.14 to 1.62), 1.23 (1.01 to 1.51), and 1.02 (0.85 to 1.23), respectively. Conclusions Results suggest that cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of T2D, which may decrease to the level of a never smoker after 10 years of smoking cessation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glucose; Hemoglobin A1c; Glucose; Hemoglobin A1c; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Article; Attributable Risk; Body Mass; Controlled Study; Female; Follow Up; Glucose Blood Level; Health Hazard; Human; Japanese (people); Major Clinical Study; Male; Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Risk Assessment; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Adverse Effects; Blood; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Japan; Middle Aged; Procedures; Proportional Hazards Model; Risk Factor; Very Elderly; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Young Adult","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; attributable risk; body mass; controlled study; female; follow up; glucose blood level; health hazard; human; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; risk assessment; smoking; smoking cessation; adverse effects; blood; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Japan; middle aged; procedures; proportional hazards model; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Young Adult","","glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6","","Lim, Stephen S., A comparative risk assessment of burden of disease and injury attributable to 67 risk factors and risk factor clusters in 21 regions, 1990-2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, The Lancet, 380, 9859, pp. 2224-2260, (2012); undefined; Idf Diabetes Atlas, (2011); Willi, Carole Clair, Active smoking and the risk of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis, JAMA, 298, 22, pp. 2654-2664, (2007); Nakanishi, Noriyuki, Cigarette smoking and risk for impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Japanese men, Annals of Internal Medicine, 133, 3, pp. 183-191, (2000); Morimoto, Akiko, Impact of smoking cessation on incidence of diabetes mellitus among overweight or normal-weight Japanese men, Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 96, 3, pp. 407-413, (2012); Rimm, Eric B., Prospective study of cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and the risk of diabetes in men, BMJ, 310, 6979, (1995); Berlin, Ivan, Smoking-induced metabolic disorders: A review, Diabetes and Metabolism, 34, 4, pp. 307-314, (2008); Hur, Nam-wook, Smoking cessation and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: Korea Medical Insurance Corporation Study, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, 14, 2, pp. 244-249, (2007); Wannamethee, Sasiwarang Goya, Smoking as a modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes in middle-aged men, Diabetes Care, 24, 9, pp. 1590-1595, (2001)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","26200457","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941334228"

However, although there are exceptions, most fossil specimens contain only low (∼ 1% or less) percentages of endogenous DNA. The only skeletal element for which a systematically higher endogenous DNA content compared to other skeletal elements has been shown is the petrous part of the temporal bone. In this study we investigate whether (a) different parts of the petrous bone of archaeological human specimens give different percentages of endogenous DNA yields, (b) there are significant differences in average DNA read lengths, damage patterns and total DNA concentration, and (c) it is possible to obtain endogenous ancient DNA from petrous bones from hot environments. We carried out intra-petrous comparisons for ten petrous bones from specimens from Holocene archaeological contexts across Eurasia dated between 10,000-1,800 calibrated years before present (cal. BP). We obtained shotgun DNA sequences from three distinct areas within the petrous: a spongy part of trabecular bone (part A), the dense part of cortical bone encircling the osseous inner ear, or otic capsule (part B), and the dense part within the otic capsule (part C). Our results confirm that dense bone parts of the petrous bone can provide high endogenous aDNA yields and indicate that endogenous DNA fractions for part C can exceed those obtained for part B by up to 65-fold and those from part A by up to 177-fold, while total endogenous DNA concentrations are up to 126-fold and 109-fold higher for these comparisons. Our results also show that while endogenous yields from part C were lower than 1% for samples from hot (both arid and humid) parts, the DNA damage patterns indicate that at least some of the reads originate from ancient DNA molecules, potentially enabling ancient DNA analyses of samples from hot regions that are otherwise not amenable to ancient DNA analyses. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna; Dna; Dna; Archeology; Article; Controlled Study; Cortical Bone; Dna Damage; Dna Determination; Dna Sequence; Holocene; Human; Human Tissue; Inner Ear; Petrous Bone; Trabecular Bone; Chemistry; Fossil; Isolation And Purification; Procedures; Archaeology; Dna Damage; Ear, Inner; Fossils; Humans; Petrous Bone; Sequence Analysis, Dna","DNA; archeology; Article; controlled study; cortical bone; DNA damage; DNA determination; DNA sequence; Holocene; human; human tissue; inner ear; petrous bone; trabecular bone; chemistry; fossil; isolation and purification; procedures; Archaeology; DNA Damage; Ear, Inner; Fossils; Humans; Petrous Bone; Sequence Analysis, DNA","","DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA","","Dabney, Jesse, Complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a Middle Pleistocene cave bear reconstructed from ultrashort DNA fragments, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 39, pp. 15758-15763, (2013); Rohland, Nadin, Comparison and optimization of ancient DNA extraction, BioTechniques, 42, 3, pp. 343-352, (2007); Rohland, Nadin, A rapid column-based ancient DNA extraction method for increased sample throughput, Molecular Ecology Resources, 10, 4, pp. 677-683, (2010); Gilbert, Thomas M.P., Notes and comments: Long-term survival of ancient DNA in Egypt: Response to Zink and Nerlich (2003), American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 128, 1, pp. 110-114, (2005); Collins, Matthew J., The survival of organic matter in bone: A review, Archaeometry, 44, 3, pp. 383-394, (2002); Barta, Jodi Lynn, Mitochondrial DNA preservation across 3000-year-old northern fur seal ribs is not related to bone density: Implications for forensic investigations, Forensic Science International, 239, pp. 11-18, (2014); Prinz, Mechthild K., DNA Commission of the International Society for Forensic Genetics (ISFG): Recommendations regarding the role of forensic genetics for disaster victim identification (DVI), Forensic Science International: Genetics, 1, 1, pp. 3-12, (2007); Gamba, Cristina, Genome flux and stasis in a five millennium transect of European prehistory, Nature Communications, 5, (2014); Rasmussen, Morten, The genome of a Late Pleistocene human from a Clovis burial site in western Montana, Nature, 506, 7487, pp. 225-229, (2014); Rasmussen, Morten, An aboriginal Australian genome reveals separate human dispersals into Asia, Science, 334, 6052, pp. 94-98, (2011)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","26086078","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939165177"

This study aims to clarify HIV serostatus in this group and elucidate risk factors for intra-marital HIV transmission. Methods: In 2012, we enrolled a group of HIV-positive married men registered at the HIV outpatient clinic of a referral hospital in northern Vietnam, along with their wives. Sociodemographic, behavioural and clinical data were collected from men and wives. HIV serodiscordant couples were followed until March 2014 to determine seroconversion rate. A phylogenetic analysis was performed based on env V3 sequence to detail cluster formation among men. Results: Of the 163 HIV-positive men enrolled in the study, 101 (62.0%) had wives testing HIV-negative. Half ofmen reported injecting drug use (IDU) as a likely transmission route. Couples reported a high incidence of unprotected sexual intercourse prior to diagnosis; the median (inter quartile range) was 4 (4-8) times per month. Only 17 couples (10.4%) reported using condoms during at least half these instances. Multivariable analysis revealed IDU history among men was independently associated with HIV-negative wives (adjusted OR 0.31; 95%CI 0.10-0.95, p=0.041). Phylogenetic analysis of 80 samples indicated CRF01-AE. Of these, 69 (86.3%) clustered with IDU-associated viruses from Vietnam. No HIV seroconversion was identified during a follow-up of 61 serodiscordant couples, with 126.5 person-years of observation during which HIV-infectedmen were on antiretroviral drug therapy (ART). Conclusion: High HIV serodiscordance was observed among HIV-affected married couples in northern Vietnam.

Traditionally, meningococcal meningitis has been diagnosed by bacterial culture. However, isolation of bacteria from patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is time consuming and sometimes yields negative results. Recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic methods of detecting Nm have been considered the gold standard because of their superior sensitivity and specificity compared with culture. In this study, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method and evaluated its ability to detect Nm in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a meningococcal LAMP assay (Nm LAMP) that targets the ctrA gene. The primer specificity was validated using 16 strains of N . meningitidis (serogroup A, B, C, D, 29-E, W-135, X, Y, and Z) and 19 non-N. meningitidis species. Within 60 min, the Nm LAMP detected down to ten copies per reaction with sensitivity 1000-fold more than that of conventional PCR. The LAMP assays were evaluated using a set of 1574 randomly selected CSF specimens from children with suspected meningitis collected between 1998 and 2002 in Vietnam, China, and Korea. The LAMP method was shown to be more sensitive than PCR methods for CSF samples (31 CSF samples were positive by LAMP vs. 25 by PCR). The detection rate of the LAMP method was substantially higher than that of the PCR method. In a comparative analysis of the PCR and LAMP assays, the clinical sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the LAMP assay were 100%, 99.6%, 80.6%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions/Significance Compared to PCR, LAMP detected Nm with higher analytical and clinical sensitivity. This sensitive and specific LAMP method offers significant advantages for screening patients on a population basis and for diagnosis in clinical settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Bacterial; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterium Detection; Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis; China; Clinical Evaluation; Controlled Study; Ctra Gene; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Epidemic Meningitis; Human; Intermethod Comparison; Korea; Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification; Neisseria Meningitidis; Nonhuman; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Predictive Value; Sensitivity And Specificity; Viet Nam; Adult; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Child; Female; Genetics; Infant; Isolation And Purification; Male; Microbiology; Nucleotide Sequence; Pathogenicity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacterial Dna; Adult; Base Sequence; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Child; Dna, Bacterial; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Meningitis, Meningococcal","Article; bacterial gene; bacterium detection; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; China; clinical evaluation; controlled study; ctrA gene; diagnostic test accuracy study; epidemic meningitis; human; intermethod comparison; Korea; loop mediated isothermal amplification; Neisseria meningitidis; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; sensitivity and specificity; Viet Nam; adult; cerebrospinal fluid; child; female; genetics; infant; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; nucleotide sequence; pathogenicity; Bacteria (microorganisms); bacterial DNA; Adult; Base Sequence; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Child; DNA, Bacterial; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Meningitis, Meningococcal","","DNA, Bacterial","Mitsuko Seki has received research grant funding from Kaneka Corp.

Since its development, EBM has been applied to integrate the best available research into diagnosis and treatment with the purpose of improving patient care. In the EBM era, a hierarchy of evidence has been proposed, including various types of research methods, such as meta-analysis (MA), systematic review (SRV), randomized controlled trial (RCT), case report (CR), practice guideline (PGL), and so on. Although there are numerous studies examining the impact and importance of specific cases of EBM in clinical practice, there is a lack of research quantitatively measuring publication trends in the growth and development of EBM. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis was constructed to determine the scientific productivity of EBM research over decades. Methods NCBI PubMed database was used to search, retrieve and classify publications according to research method and year of publication. Joinpoint regression analysis was undertaken to analyze trends in research productivity and the prevalence of individual research methods. Findings Analysis indicates that MA and SRV, which are classified as the highest ranking of evidence in the EBM, accounted for a relatively small but auspicious number of publications. For most research methods, the annual percent change (APC) indicates a consistent increase in publication frequency. MA, SRV and RCT show the highest rate of publication growth in the past twenty years. Only controlled clinical trials (CCT) shows a non-significant reduction in publications over the past ten years. Conclusions Higher quality research methods, such as MA, SRV and RCT, are showing continuous publication growth, which suggests an acknowledgement of the value of these methods. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of research method publication trends in EBM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Bibliometrics; Clinical Practice; Controlled Clinical Trial (topic); Evidence Based Medicine; Medical Literature; Medical Research; Meta Analysis (topic); Methodology; Prevalence; Productivity; Publication; Randomized Controlled Trial (topic); Regression Analysis; Systematic Review (topic); Trend Study; Human; Procedures; Trends; Biomedical Research; Evidence-based Medicine; Humans","Article; bibliometrics; clinical practice; controlled clinical trial (topic); evidence based medicine; medical literature; medical research; meta analysis (topic); methodology; prevalence; productivity; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); regression analysis; systematic review (topic); trend study; human; procedures; trends; Biomedical Research; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans","","","","Goldman, Joshua J., The limitations of evidence-based medicine—applying population-based recommendations to individual patients, The virtual mentor : VM, 13, 1, pp. 26-30, (2011); Talaulikar, Vikram Sinai, Evidence-based medicine: An obstetrician and gynaecologist's perspective, Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology of India, 62, 2, pp. 146-153, (2012); Gerber-Grote, Andreas U., Evidence-based medicine is rooted in Protestant exegesis, Medical Hypotheses, 64, 5, pp. 1034-1038, (2005); Evidence-Based Medicine: A New Approach to Teaching the Practice of Medicine, JAMA, 268, 17, pp. 2420-2425, (1992); Woolf, Steven H., Evidence-based medicine: Interpreting studies and setting policy, Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America, 14, 4, pp. 761-784, (2000); Claridge, Jeffrey A., History and development of evidence-based medicine, World Journal of Surgery, 29, 5, pp. 547-553, (2005); Sackett, David L., Evidence based medicine: What it is and what it isn't.

In autistic children, urinary amino acid profiles have revealed metabolic alterations in the amino acids that serve as neurotransmitters in the developing brain. Therefore, our present study aimed to investigate the use of alterations in urinary amino acid excretion as biomarkers of dioxin exposure-induced neurodevelopmental deficits in highly exposed 3-year-old children in Vietnam. A nested case-control study of urinary analyses was performed for 26 children who were selected from 111 3-year-old children whose perinatal dioxin exposure levels and neurodevelopmental status were examined in follow-up surveys conducted in a dioxin contaminated hot spot. We compared urinary amino acid levels between the following 4 groups: (1) a high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and high TCDD-exposed group; (2) a high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs but low TCDD-exposed group; (3) a low TEQ-PCDDs/Fs exposed and poorly developed group; and (4) a low TEQ-PCDDs/Fs exposed and well-developed group. Urinary levels of histidine and tryptophan were significantly decreased in the high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and high TCDD group, as well as in the high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs but low TCDD group, compared with the low TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and well-developed group. However, the ratio of histidine to glycine was significantly lower only in the high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and high TCDD group. Furthermore, urinary histidine levels and the ratio of histidine to glycine were significantly correlated with neurodevelopmental scores, particularly for language and fine motor skills. These results indicate that urinary histidine is specifically associated with dioxin exposure-induced neurodevelopmental deficits, suggesting that urinary histidine may be a useful marker of dioxin-induced neurodevelopmental deficits and that histaminergic neurotransmission may be an important pathological contributor to dioxin-mediated neurotoxicity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Amino Acid; Glycine; Histidine; Lysine; Taurine; Tryptophan; Amino Acids; Biomarkers; Dioxins; 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo Para Dioxin; Amino Acid; Dioxin; Glycine; Histidine; Lysine; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxin; Taurine; Tryptophan; Biological Marker; Amino Acid Urine Level; Article; Bayley Scales Of Infant Development; Breast Milk; Case Control Study; Central Nervous System Disease; Child; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Disease Association; Environmental Exposure; Female; Follow Up; Health Survey; Histamine Metabolism; Human; Language Disability; Male; Motor Dysfunction; Motor Performance; Nested Case Control Study; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; Neurotoxicity; Neurotransmission; Perinatal Period; Preschool Child; Urinalysis; Viet Nam; Adverse Effects; Chemically Induced; Infant; Maternal Exposure; Mental Disease; Metabolism; Pregnancy; Urine; Amino Acids; Biomarkers; Case-control Studies; Child, Preschool; Dioxins; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Maternal Exposure; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Pregnancy; Vietnam","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; amino acid; dioxin; glycine; histidine; lysine; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; taurine; tryptophan; biological marker; amino acid urine level; Article; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; breast milk; case control study; central nervous system disease; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; environmental exposure; female; follow up; health survey; histamine metabolism; human; language disability; male; motor dysfunction; motor performance; nested case control study; neurodevelopmental disorder; neurotoxicity; neurotransmission; perinatal period; preschool child; urinalysis; Viet Nam; adverse effects; chemically induced; infant; maternal exposure; mental disease; metabolism; pregnancy; urine; Amino Acids; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Dioxins; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Maternal Exposure; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Pregnancy; Vietnam","","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin, 1746-01-6; amino acid, 65072-01-7; glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; histidine, 645-35-2, 7006-35-1, 71-00-1; lysine, 56-87-1, 6899-06-5, 70-54-2; taurine, 107-35-7; tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; Amino Acids; Biomarkers; Dioxins","","Nishijo, Muneko, Impact of perinatal dioxin exposure on infant growth: A cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam, PLOS ONE, 7, 7, (2012); Organohalogen Compounds, (2012); Tai, Pham The, Dioxin exposure in breast milk and infant neurodevelopment in Vietnam, Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 70, 9, pp. 656-662, (2013); Nishijo, Muneko, 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in breast milk increases autistic traits of 3-year-old children in Vietnam, Molecular Psychiatry, 19, 11, pp. 1220-1226, (2014); Nature News, (2012); Shimmura, Chie, Alteration of plasma glutamate and glutamine levels in children with high-functioning autism, PLOS ONE, 6, 10, (2011); Yap, Ivan Kok Seng, Urinary metabolic phenotyping differentiates children with autism from their unaffected siblings and age-matched controls, Journal of Proteome Research, 9, 6, pp. 2996-3004, (2010); Ghanizadeh, Ahmad, Increased glutamate and homocysteine and decreased glutamine levels in autism: A review and strategies for future studies of amino acids in autism, Disease Markers, 35, 5, pp. 281-286, (2013); Ahearn, William H., An Assessment of Food Acceptance in Children with Autism or Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 31, 5, pp. 505-511, (2001); Dwernychuk, L.

In this study, we identified the members of the NAC TF family of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and assess their expression profiles during plant development and under dehydration and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments in a systematic manner. Seventy-one CaNAC genes were detected from the chickpea genome, including 8 membrane-bound members of which many might be involved in dehydration responses as judged from published literature. Phylogenetic analysis of the chickpea and well-known stress-related Arabidopsis and rice NACs enabled us to predict several putative stress-related CaNACs. By exploring available transcriptome data, we provided a comprehensive expression atlas of CaNACs in various tissues at different developmental stages. With the highest interest in dehydration responses, we examined the expression of the predicted stress-related and membrane-bound CaNACs in roots and leaves of chickpea seedlings, subjected to well-watered (control), dehydration and ABA treatments, using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Nine-teen of the 23 CaNACs examined were found to be dehydration-responsive in chickpea roots and/ or leaves in either ABA-dependent or -independent pathway. Our results have provided a solid foundation for selection of promising tissue-specific and/or dehydration-responsive CaNAC candidates for detailed in planta functional analyses, leading to development of transgenic chickpea varieties with improved productivity under drought. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abscisic Acid; Abscisic Acid; Transcription Factors; Abscisic Acid; Transcription Factor; Arabidopsis; Article; Chickpea; Chromosomal Localization; Controlled Study; Drought; Drought Tolerance; Gene Control; Gene Duplication; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Function; Gene Identification; Gene Sequence; Genetic Association; Molecular Phylogeny; Nac02 Gene; Nac04 Gene; Nac05 Gene; Nac06 Gene; Nac16 Gene; Nac19 Gene; Nac21 Gene; Nac24 Gene; Nac27 Gene; Nac31 Gene; Nac33 Gene; Nac39 Gene; Nac40 Gene; Nac41 Gene; Nac43 Gene; Nac44 Gene; Nac46 Gene; Nac47 Gene; Nac50 Gene; Nac52 Gene; Nac57 Gene; Nac67 Gene; Nac71 Gene; Nonhuman; Plant Development; Plant Gene; Plant Genome; Plant Leaf; Plant Response; Plant Root; Plant Tissue; Rice; Tissue Specificity; Biosynthesis; Cicer; Drug Effects; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Physiological Stress; Physiology; Cicer Arietinum; Abscisic Acid; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors","abscisic acid; transcription factor; Arabidopsis; Article; chickpea; chromosomal localization; controlled study; drought; drought tolerance; gene control; gene duplication; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic association; molecular phylogeny; NAC02 gene; NAC04 gene; NAC05 gene; NAC06 gene; NAC16 gene; NAC19 gene; NAC21 gene; NAC24 gene; NAC27 gene; NAC31 gene; NAC33 gene; NAC39 gene; NAC40 gene; NAC41 gene; NAC43 gene; NAC44 gene; NAC46 gene; NAC47 gene; NAC50 gene; NAC52 gene; NAC57 gene; NAC67 gene; NAC71 gene; nonhuman; plant development; plant gene; plant genome; plant leaf; plant response; plant root; plant tissue; rice; tissue specificity; biosynthesis; Cicer; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; multigene family; phylogeny; physiological stress; physiology; Cicer arietinum; Abscisic Acid; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors","","abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; Abscisic Acid; Transcription Factors","","Jukanti, Aravind Kumar, Nutritional quality and health benefits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.): A review, British Journal of Nutrition, 108, SUPPL. 1, pp. S11-S26, (2012); Rubio, Luis A., Ileal digestibility of defatted soybean, lupin and chickpea seed meals in cannulated Iberian pigs: I.

Climatic factors, followed by edaphic and spatial variables, constitute the best predictors of fungal richness and community composition at the global scale.

Here, we report the critical role of early growth factor 4 (EGR4), a DNA-binding, zincfinger transcription factor, in cell proliferation of SCLC. EGR4 overexpression in HEK293T cells conferred significant upregulation of specific splice variants of the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) gene, resulting in enhancement of the secretion of PTHrP protein, a known mediator of osteolytic bone metastasis. More importantly, depletion of EGR4 expression by siRNA significantly suppressed growth of the SCLC cell lines, SBC-5, SBC-3 and NCI-H1048. On the other hand, introduction of EGR4 into NIH3T3 cells significantly enhanced cell growth. We identified four EGR4 target genes, SAMD5, RAB15, SYNPO and DLX5, which were the most significantly downregulated genes upon depletion of EGR4 expression in all of the SCLC cells examined, and demonstrated the direct recruitment of EGR4 to their promoters by ChIP and luciferase reporter analysis. Notably, knockdown of the expression of these genes by siRNA remarkably suppressed the growth of all the SCLC cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that EGR4 likely regulates the bone metastasis and proliferation of SCLC cells via transcriptional regulation of several target genes, and may therefore be a promising target for the development of anticancer drugs for SCLC patients.

As non-vaccine serotypes have emerged after the introduction of 7-valent conjugate vaccines, study of serotype specific epidemiology is in need. When two or more serotypes co-colonize, they evolve rapidly to defend host's immune responses; however, a clear association of cocolonization with a clinical outcome is lacking.

Carriage of pneumococcus was determined by culture and lytA PCR in the nasopharyngeal samples. Serotype/serogroup detection and its quantification were done by the nanofluidic real time PCR system. Spearman's correlation and logistic regression were used to examine a correlation of serotype/serogroup specific bacterial load with its prevalence and an association of co-colonization with ARI respectively. Results: Serotype/serogroup specific bacterial load was correlated with its prevalence, both in ARI cases (Spearman's rho = 0.44, n = 186; P<0.0001) and healthy children (Spearman's rho = 0.41, n = 115; P<0.0001). The prevalence of multiple serotypes was more common in ARI cases than in healthy children (18.5% vs 7.1%; aOR 2.92, 95% CI: 1.27-6.71; P = 0.01). The dominant serotype in the co-colonization had a 2 log10 higher bacterial load than the subdominant serotype, both in ARI cases (P<0.001) and healthy children (P<0.05). Conclusions: High bacterial load in the nasopharynx may help transmit pneumococci among hosts, and increase the chance of successful acquisition and colonization. Co-colonization of multiple serotypes of pneumococci is linked with ARI, which infers the interactions of multiple serotypes may increase their pathogenicity; however, they may compete for growth in number. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age; Article; Bacterial Colonization; Bacterial Load; Bacterial Transmission; Child; Child Health; Controlled Study; Disease Association; Female; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nanofluidics; Nonhuman; Pneumococcal Infection; Quantitative Analysis; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory Tract Infection; Serotype; Sex Ratio; Streptococcus Pneumoniae; Acute Disease; Case Control Study; Genetics; Infant; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Nasopharynx; Physiology; Preschool Child; Prevalence; Bacteria (microorganisms); Acute Disease; Bacterial Load; Case-control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Nasopharynx; Prevalence; Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory Tract Infections; Serogroup","age; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterial load; bacterial transmission; child; child health; controlled study; disease association; female; human; major clinical study; male; nanofluidics; nonhuman; pneumococcal infection; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract infection; serotype; sex ratio; Streptococcus pneumoniae; acute disease; case control study; genetics; infant; isolation and purification; microbiology; nasopharynx; physiology; preschool child; prevalence; Bacteria (microorganisms); Acute Disease; Bacterial Load; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Nasopharynx; Prevalence; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory Tract Infections; Serogroup","","","We are grateful to children and their parents who participated in this study.

Recently, the emergence of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans resulted in rapid declines in populations of European fire salamanders. Here, we screened more than 5000 amphibians from across four continents and combined experimental assessment of pathogenicity with phylogenetic methods to estimate the threat that this infection poses to amphibian diversity. Results show that B. salamandrivorans is restricted to, but highly pathogenic for, salamanders and newts (Urodela). The pathogen likely originated and remained in coexistence with a clade of salamander hosts for millions of years in Asia. As a result of globalization and lack of biosecurity, it has recently been introduced into naïve European amphibian populations, where it is currently causing biodiversity loss. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amphibian; Biodiversity; Emergence; Fungal Disease; Global Change; Habitat Loss; Native Species; Palearctic Ecozone; Pathogenicity; Phylogenetics; Population Decline; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Article; Batrachochytrium; Batrachochytrium Salamandrivorans; Epidemic; Histopathology; Host Range; Immunohistochemistry; Nonhuman; Pathogen Load; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Quantitative Analysis; Salamandra Salamandra; Species Diversity; Zoospore; Animal; Animal Disease; Article; Chytridiomycetes; Classification; Communicable Disease; Endangered Species; Microbiology; Mycosis; Phylogeny; Urodela; Fungi; Salamandroidea; Animals; Biodiversity; Chytridiomycota; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Endangered Species; Mycoses; Phylogeny","amphibian; biodiversity; emergence; fungal disease; global change; habitat loss; native species; Palearctic Ecozone; pathogenicity; phylogenetics; population decline; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Batrachochytrium; Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans; epidemic; histopathology; host range; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; pathogen load; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative analysis; Salamandra salamandra; species diversity; zoospore; animal; animal disease; article; Chytridiomycetes; classification; communicable disease; endangered species; microbiology; mycosis; phylogeny; Urodela; Fungi; Salamandroidea; Animals; Biodiversity; Chytridiomycota; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Endangered Species; Mycoses; Phylogeny","","","","Wake, David B., Are we in the midst of the sixth mass extinction?

Many observers are concerned that aging will adversely affect public finances and standards of living. Analysis of newly available National Transfer Accounts data for 40 countries shows that fertility well above replacement would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility below replacement would maximize per capita consumption when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account. Although low fertility will indeed challenge government programs and very low fertility undermines living standards, we find that moderately low fertility and population decline favor the broader material standard of living. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age; Aging; Article; Birth Rate; Economics; Female; Fertility; Human; Income; Population Growth; Socioeconomics; Tax; Age Factors; Aging; Birth Rate; Economics; Female; Fertility; Humans; Income; Income Tax; Population Growth; Socioeconomic Factors","age; aging; article; birth rate; economics; female; fertility; human; income; population growth; socioeconomics; tax; Age Factors; Aging; Birth Rate; Economics; Female; Fertility; Humans; Income; Income Tax; Population Growth; Socioeconomic Factors","","","","World Population Prospects the 2004 Revision, (2005); World Population Policies 2009, (2010); Demographic Dividend A New Perspective on the Economic Consequences of Population Change, (2003); International Economic Review, (1978); Economics of Changing Age Distributions in Developed Countries, (1988); Demography of Aging, (1994); Lee, Ronald Demos, Population age structure, intergenerational transfer, and wealth: a new approach, with applications to the United States, Journal of Human Resources, 29, 4, pp. 1027-1063, (1994); Lee, Ronald Demos, Population aging and the generational economy: A global perspective, (2011); undefined; Developments in the Economics of Aging, (2009)","","American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","","","10959203; 00368075","9781844654512; 9781844652044","SCIEA","25301626","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907814963"

To improve the resolution of fine-scale mapping at FTO, we performed a systematic approach consisting of two parts. Methods: The first part is to partition the associated variants into linkage disequilibrium (LD) clusters, followed by conditional and haplotype analyses. The second part is to filter the list of potential causal variants through trans-ethnic comparison. Results: We first examined the LD relationship between FTO SNPs showing significant association with type 2 diabetes in Japanese GWAS and between those previously reported in European GWAS. We could partition all the assayed or imputed SNPs showing significant association in the target FTO region into 7 LD clusters. Assaying 9 selected SNPs in 4 Asian-descent populations - Japanese, Vietnamese, Sri Lankan and Chinese (n≤26,109 for BMI association and n≤24,079 for type 2 diabetes association), we identified a responsible haplotype tagged by a cluster of SNPs and successfully narrowed the list of potential causal variants to 25 SNPs, which are the smallest in number among the studies conducted to date for FTO. Conclusions: Our data support that the power to resolve the causal variants from those in strong LD increases consistently when three distant populations - Europeans, Asians and Africans - are included in the follow-up study. It has to be noted that this fine-mapping approach has the advantage of applicability to the existing GWAS data set in combination with direct genotyping of selected variants. © 2014 Akiyama et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Fto Protein, Human; Proteins; Adult; Aged; Article; Asian; Body Mass; Chinese; Controlled Study; Disease Association; Ethnic Difference; Female; Fto Gene; Gene; Gene Cluster; Gene Linkage Disequilibrium; Gene Locus; Gene Mapping; Genetic Association; Genetic Variability; Haplotype; Human; Japanese (people); Major Clinical Study; Male; Middle Aged; Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Sri Lankan; Vietnamese; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Ethnology; Genetics; Fto Protein, Human; Protein; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proteins","adult; aged; article; Asian; body mass; Chinese; controlled study; disease association; ethnic difference; female; FTO gene; gene; gene cluster; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic association; genetic variability; haplotype; human; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; single nucleotide polymorphism; Sri Lankan; Vietnamese; Asian continental ancestry group; ethnology; genetics; FTO protein, human; protein; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proteins","","protein, 67254-75-5; FTO protein, human; Proteins","","Edwards, Stacey L., Beyond GWASs: Illuminating the dark road from association to function, American Journal of Human Genetics, 93, 5, pp. 779-797, (2013); Dunning, Alison M., The extent of linkage disequilibrium in four populations with distinct demographic histories, American Journal of Human Genetics, 67, 6, pp. 1544-1554, (2000); Zaitlen, Noah A., Leveraging Genetic Variability across Populations for the Identification of Causal Variants, American Journal of Human Genetics, 86, 1, pp. 23-33, (2010); Teo, Yik Ying, Identifying candidate causal variants via trans-population fine-mapping, Genetic Epidemiology, 34, 7, pp. 653-664, (2010); Morris, Andrew Paul, Transethnic meta-analysis of genomewide association studies, Genetic Epidemiology, 35, 8, pp. 809-822, (2011); Hassanein, Mohamed T., Fine mapping of the association with obesity at the FTO locus in African-derived populations, Human Molecular Genetics, 19, 14, pp. 2907-2916, (2010); Peters, Ulrike, A Systematic Mapping Approach of 16q12.2/FTO and BMI in More Than 20,000 African Americans Narrows in on the Underlying Functional Variation: Results from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study, PLOS Genetics, 9, 1, (2013); Tsuchihashi-Makaya, Miyuki, Gene-environmental interaction regarding alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in the Japanese general population, Hypertension Research, 32, 3, pp. 207-213, (2009); Nanri, Akiko, Dietary patterns and C-reactive protein in Japanese men and women, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 87, 5, pp. 1488-1496, (2008); Takeuchi, Fumihiko, Confirmation of multiple risk loci and genetic impacts by a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population, Diabetes, 58, 7, pp. 1690-1699, (2009)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24978468","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903592218"

We investigated the joint association of weight status and estimated VO <inf>2max</inf>, a marker of fitness, with the risk of developing T2DM among Japanese men using haemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose criterion. Methods: The present study included 3,523 male employees aged 18-61 years without diabetes who provided health check-up and fitness data in Japan in 2003-2005. We calculated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident diabetes using the Cox regression model. Results: During a mean follow-up of 6.0 years, 199 men developed diabetes. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of diabetes were 1.00 (reference), 1.44 (1.01-2.07), and 1.48 (1.03-2.13) for the highest through the lowest tertile of fitness (P for trend = 0.04). Additional adjustment for body mass index largely attenuated the association of fitness with diabetes. Joint analysis showed that adjusted hazard ratios of diabetes were 1.00, 1.32, 2.94, and 1.83 in normal weight high-fit men, normal weight low-fit men, overweight high-fit men, and overweight low-fit men, respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that weight control is more important than fitness in prevention of type 2 diabetes in Japanese men. © 2014 Kuwahara et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glucose; Hemoglobin A1c; Glucose; Hemoglobin A1c; Adult; Article; Body Mass; Diet Restriction; Employee; Fitness; Follow Up; Human; Japanese (people); Major Clinical Study; Male; Medical Examination; Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; Risk Assessment; Adolescent; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exercise Test; Incidence; Japan; Middle Aged; Physiology; Risk; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Mass Index; Exercise Test; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Physical Fitness; Risk; Young Adult","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; adult; article; body mass; diet restriction; employee; fitness; follow up; human; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; medical examination; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; risk assessment; adolescent; Asian continental ancestry group; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; exercise test; incidence; Japan; middle aged; physiology; risk; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Mass Index; Exercise Test; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Physical Fitness; Risk; Young Adult","","glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6","","Shaw, Jonathan E., Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030, Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 87, 1, pp. 4-14, (2010); Colberg, Sheri R., Exercise and type 2 diabetes: The American College of Sports Medicine and the American Diabetes Association: Joint position statement, Diabetes Care, 33, 12, pp. e147-e167, (2010); Jeon, Christie Younghae, Physical activity of moderate intensity and risk of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review, Diabetes Care, 30, 3, pp. 744-752, (2007); Demakakos, Panayotes, Low-intensity physical activity is associated with reduced risk of incident type 2 diabetes in older adults: Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Diabetologia, 53, 9, pp. 1877-1885, (2010); Williams, Paul T., Walking versus running for hypertension, cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus risk reduction, Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, 33, 5, pp. 1085-1091, (2013); Shephard, Roy J., Limits to the measurement of habitual physical activity by questionnaires, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 3, pp. 197-206, (2003); Blair, Steven N., The fitness, obesity, and health equation: Is physical activity the common denominator?, JAMA, 292, 10, pp. 1232-1234, (2004); Prince, Stephanie A., A comparison of direct versus self-report measures for assessing physical activity in adults: A systematic review, International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 5, (2008); Caspersen, Carl J., Physical activity, exercise and physical fitness: definitions and distinctions for health-related research, Public Health Reports, 100, 2, pp. 126-131, (1985); Haskell, William L., Methodologic issues in measuring physical activity and physical fitness when evaluating the role of dietary supplements for physically active people, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 72, 2 SUPPL., (2000)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24896640","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902449600"

We hypothesized that √Aaw at Pi10 differs among the five lung lobes and √Aaw at Pi10 derived from one certain lung lobe has a high level of agreement with that derived from the whole lungs in smokers. Methods: Pulmonary function tests and chest volumetric CTs were performed in 157 male smokers (102 COPD, 55 non-COPD). All visible bronchial segments from the 3rd to 5th generations were segmented and measured using commercially available 3-dimensional CT analysis software. √Aaw at Pi10 of each lung lobe was estimated from all measurable bronchial segments of that lobe. Results: Using a mixed-effects model, √Aaw at Pi10 differed significantly among the five lung lobes (R 2 = 0.78, P<0.0001). The Bland-Altman plots show that √Aaw at Pi10 derived from the right or left upper lobe had a high level of agreement with that derived from the whole lungs, while √Aaw at Pi10 derived from the right or left lower lobe did not. Conclusion: In male smokers, CT-derived airway wall area differs among the five lung lobes, and airway wall area derived from the right or left upper lobe is representative of the whole lungs. © 2014 Tho et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Toshiba Aquilion 64; Adult; Aged; Airway Wall Area; Article; Computed Tomography Scanner; Computer Assisted Tomography; Computer Program; Controlled Study; Disease Severity; Human; Lung Function Test; Lung Lobe; Major Clinical Study; Male; Smoking; Thorax Wall; Three Dimensional Imaging; Volumetry; Adverse Effects; Bronchus; Chemically Induced; Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; Four Dimensional Computed Tomography; Middle Aged; Pathology; Pathophysiology; Procedures; Very Elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Bronchi; Four-dimensional Computed Tomography; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiratory Function Tests; Smoking","adult; aged; airway wall area; article; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; computer program; controlled study; disease severity; human; lung function test; lung lobe; major clinical study; male; smoking; thorax wall; three dimensional imaging; volumetry; adverse effects; bronchus; chemically induced; chronic obstructive lung disease; four dimensional computed tomography; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bronchi; Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiratory Function Tests; Smoking","","","The authors have read the journal's policy and have the following conflicts: NVT received the 2009 Harasawa Fellowship from the Japanese Respiratory Society, the 2011 APSR Short-Term Research/Training Fellowship from the Asia Pacific Society of Respirology, and a research grant from the Shiga Medical Association for International Cooperation in 2011.

However, each of these effects (cancer-promoting or anti-cancer) was found in different cells at different treatedconcentration of arsenic. In this study, we for the first time indicated that arsenic at concentration of 3 μM, equal to average concentration in drinking water in cancer-prone areas in Bangladesh, simultaneously expressed its bidirectional effects on human squamous cell carcinoma HSC5 cells with distinct pathways. Treatment with 3 μM of arsenic promoted cell invasion via upregulation of expression of MT1-MMP and downregulation of expression of p14ARF and simultaneously induced cell apoptosis through inhibition of expression of N-cadherin and increase of expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) at both transcript and protein levels in HSC5 cells. We also showed that inhibition of MT1-MMP expression by NSC405020 resulted in decrease of arsenic-mediated invasion of HSC5 cells involving decrease in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERK). Taken together, our biological and biochemical findings suggested that arsenic expressed bidirectional effects as a carcinogen and an anti-cancer agent in human squamous cell carcinoma HSC5 cells with distinct pathways. Our results might play an important scientific evident for further studies to find out a better way in treatment of arsenic-induced cancers, especially in squamous cell carcinoma. © 2014 Thang et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arsenic;

We examined the association between overtime work and prevalence of diabetes among Japanese workers. Methods: The subjects were 40,861 employees (35,170 men and 5,691 women), aged 16 to 83 years, of 4 companies in Japan. Hours of overtime were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Diabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l), hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or current use of anti-diabetic drug. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratio of diabetes for each category of overtime. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, company, smoking, and BMI, there was a suggestion of U-shaped relationship between overtime work and prevalence of diabetes (P for quadratic trend = 0.07). Compared with those who worked <45 hours of overtime per month, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of diabetes were 0.86 (0.77-0.94), 0.69 (0.53-0.89), and 1.03 (0.72-1.46) for those who worked 45-79, 80-99, and ≥100 hours of overtime per month, respectively. In one company (n = 33,807), where other potential confounders including shift work, job position, type of department, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, leisure time physical activity, and family history of diabetes was additionally adjusted for, similar result was obtained (P for quadratic trend = 0.05). Conclusions: Long hours of overtime work may not be associated with increased prevalence of diabetes among Japanese workers. © 2014 Kuwahara et al. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alcohol; Glucose; Hemoglobin A1c; Alcohol; Antidiabetic Agent; Glucose; Hemoglobin A1c; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Consumption; Article; Body Mass; Cardiovascular Disease; Controlled Study; Diabetes Mellitus; Employee; Family History; Female; Glucose Blood Level; Human; Japan; Japanese (people); Leisure; Major Clinical Study; Male; Occupational Health; Physical Activity; Prevalence; Questionnaire; Self Report; Shift Worker; Sleep Time; Smoking; Very Elderly; Working Time; Epidemiology; Middle Aged; Risk; Risk Factor; Work Schedule; Workload; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Work Schedule Tolerance; Workload; Young Adult","alcohol; antidiabetic agent; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; adolescent; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; employee; family history; female; glucose blood level; human; Japan; Japanese (people); leisure; major clinical study; male; occupational health; physical activity; prevalence; questionnaire; self report; shift worker; sleep time; smoking; very elderly; working time; epidemiology; middle aged; risk; risk factor; work schedule; workload; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Work Schedule Tolerance; Workload; Young Adult","","alcohol, 64-17-5; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3; hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6","","Spurgeon, Anne, Health and safety problems associated with long working hours: A review of the current position, Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 54, 6, pp. 367-375, (1997); van der Hulst, Monique, Long workhours and health, Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health, 29, 3, pp. 171-188, (2003); Virtanen, Marianna, Long working hours and coronary heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis, American Journal of Epidemiology, 176, 7, pp. 586-596, (2012); Nagai, Michiaki, Sleep duration as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease - A review of the recent literature, Current Cardiology Reviews, 6, 1, pp. 54-61, (2010); Cappuccio, Francesco Paolo, Quantity and quality of sleep and incidence of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Diabetes Care, 33, 2, pp. 414-420, (2010); Weber, Mary Beth, Type 2 diabetes in asians: Prevalence, risk factors, and effectiveness of behavioral intervention at individual and population levels, Annual Review of Nutrition, 32, pp. 417-439, (2012); Nyberg, Solja T., Job Strain and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Meta-Analysis of Individual-Participant Data from 47,000 Men and Women, PLOS ONE, 8, 6, (2013); Lee, Sangheon, Working Time Around the World: Trends in working hours, laws and policies in a global comparative perspective, pp. 1-220, (2007); Shaw, Jonathan E., Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030, Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 87, 1, pp. 4-14, (2010); Sarwar, Nadeem, Diabetes mellitus, fasting blood glucose concentration, and risk of vascular disease: A collaborative meta-analysis of 102 prospective studies, The Lancet, 375, 9733, pp. 2215-2222, (2010)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24787995","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900413318"

During July 2010 to March 2012, we surveyed monthly for Aedes larvae and pupae in 120 houses in 8 Hanoi districts. Aedes albopictus preferred discarded containers in summer and pupal density drastically decreased in winter. Aedes aegypti preferred concrete tanks and this preference increased in winter. Even in winter, the lowest water temperature found in concrete tanks was >14°C, exceeding the developmental zero point of Ae. aegypti. Although jars, drums and concrete tanks were the dominant containers previously (1994-97) in Hanoi, currently the percentage of residences with concrete tanks was still high while jars and drums were quite low. Our study showed that concrete tanks with broken lids allowing mosquitoes access were important winter refuge for Ae. aegypti. We also indicate a concern about concrete tanks serving as foci for Ae. aegypti to expand their distribution in cooler regions. © 2014 Tsunoda et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aedes Aegypti; Aedes Albopictus; Article; Environmental Monitoring; Insect Development; Larva; Nonhuman; Pupa (life Cycle Stage); Seasonal Variation; Species Refuge; Summer; Tank; Viet Nam; Water Temperature; Winter; Aedes; Animal; Ecosystem; Physiology; Season; Species Difference; Temperature; Water Supply; Animals; Ecosystem; Seasons; Species Specificity; Temperature; Vietnam; Water Supply","Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; article; environmental monitoring; insect development; larva; nonhuman; pupa (life cycle stage); seasonal variation; species refuge; summer; tank; Viet Nam; water temperature; winter; Aedes; animal; ecosystem; physiology; season; species difference; temperature; water supply; Animals; Ecosystem; Seasons; Species Specificity; Temperature; Vietnam; Water Supply","","","","Beatty, Mark Edward, Health economics of dengue: A systematic literature review and expert panel's assessment, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 84, 3, pp. 473-488, (2011); Dengue and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, (1997); Cuong, Hoang Quoc, Quantifying the emergence of dengue in Hanoi, Vietnam: 1998-2009, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 5, 9, (2011); Analysis of Communicable Disease Data in Vietnam 2008, (2009); Analysis of Communicable Disease Data in Vietnam 2009, (2010); Hanoi Vietnam Travel Weather Averages Weatherbase, (2012); Bar-Zeev, Micha, The effect of temperature on the growth rate and survival of the immature stages of Aëdes aegypti (L.)., Bulletin of Entomological Research, 49, 1, pp. 157-163, (1958); Hawley, William A., The biology of Aedes albopictus., Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association.

The aim of the study was to assess anti-H. pylori effects of the sesquiterpene lactone dehydrocostus lactone (DCL) from Magnolia sieboldii leaves, compared to commercial pure DCL, two previously known sesquiterpene lactones (costunolide and parthenolide), (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, and four antibiotics. The antibacterial activity of natural DCL toward antibiotic-susceptible H. pylori ATCC 700392 and H. pylori ATCC 700824 strains (MIC, 4.9 and 4.4 mg/L) was similar to that of commercial DCL and was more effective than costunolide, parthenolide, and EGCG. The activity of DCL was slightly lower than that of metronidazole (MIC, 1.10 and 1.07 mg/L). The antibacterial activity of DCL was virtually identical toward susceptible and resistant strains, even though resistance to amoxicillin (MIC, 11.1 mg/L for PED 503G strain), clarithromycin (49.8 mg/L for PED 3582GA strain), metronidazole (21.6 mg/L for H. pylori ATCC 43504 strain; 71.1 mg/L for 221 strain), or tetracycline (14.2 mg/L for B strain) was observed. This finding indicates that DCL and the antibiotics do not share a common mode of action. The bactericidal activity of DCL toward H. pylori ATCC 43504 was not affected by pH values examined (4.0-7.0). DCL caused considerable conversion to coccoid form (94 versus 49% at 8 and 4 mg/L of DCL for 48 h). The Western blot analysis revealed that urease subunits (UreA and UreB) of H. pylori ATCC 43504 were not affected by 10 mM of DCL, whereas UreA monomer band completely disappeared at 0.1 mM of (-)- epigallocatechin gallate.

Here we show that map-based cloning of Pi35 identifies multiple functional polymorphisms that allow effective control of the disease, and that Pi35 is allelic to Pish, which mediates race-specific resistance to blast and encodes a protein containing a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Analysis using Pish-Pi35 chimeric genes demonstrated that multiple functional polymorphisms cumulatively enhance resistance, and that an amino acid residue in a LRR of Pi35 is strongly associated with the gene's mediation of quantitative but consistent resistance to pathogen isolates in Japan, in contrast to Pish, which mediates resistance to only a single isolate. Our results reinforce the substantial importance of mining allelic variation for crop breeding. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Genomics for Agricultural Innovation QTL2002, Genomics-based Technology for Agricultural Improvement, LCT0013, Development of mitigation and adaptation techniques to global warming in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, rice— 2001).

The possibility of determining the nature of massive neutrinos and, if neutrinos are Majorana fermions, of obtaining information about the Majorana phases in the neutrino mixing matrix, is analised in the cases of normal hierarchical, inverted hierarchical and quasi-degenerate types of neutrino mass spectrum. It is found, in particular, that the sensitivity to the nature of massive neutrinos depends critically on the atomic level energy difference relevant in the RENP. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atoms; High Energy Physics; Mass Spectrometry; Mixing; Neutrons; Particle Beams; Photons; Telescopes; Continuous Spectrum; Emission Modes; Energy Differences; Majorana Phasis; Metastable Levels; Neutrino Mixing; Neutrino Pairs; Radiative Emissions; Elementary Particles","Atoms; High energy physics; Mass spectrometry; Mixing; Neutrons; Particle beams; Photons; Telescopes; Continuous spectrum; Emission modes; Energy differences; Majorana phasis; Metastable levels; Neutrino mixing; Neutrino pairs; Radiative emissions; Elementary particles","","","","Dinh, Dinh Nguyen, Observables in neutrino mass spectroscopy using atoms, Physics Letters, Section B: Nuclear, Elementary Particle and High-Energy Physics, 719, 1-3, pp. 154-163, (2013); Phys Rev D, (2012); Yoshimura, Motohiko, Neutrino pair emission from excited atoms, Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology, 75, 11, (2007); Yoshimura, Motohiko, Solitons and precision neutrino mass spectroscopy, Physics Letters, Section B: Nuclear, Elementary Particle and High-Energy Physics, 699, 1-2, pp. 123-128, (2011); Bilenky, Samoil M., On the oscillations of neutrinos with Dirac and Majorana masses, Physics Letters, Section B: Nuclear, Elementary Particle and High-Energy Physics, 94, 4, pp. 495-498, (1980); Molinaro, Emiliano, The interplay between ""low"" and ""high"" energy CP-violation in leptogenesis, European Physical Journal C, 61, 1, pp. 93-109, (2009); Wolfenstein, Lincoln, CP properties of Majorana neutrinos and double beta decay, Physics Letters, Section B: Nuclear, Elementary Particle and High-Energy Physics, 107, 1-2, pp. 77-79, (1981); Bilenky, Samoil M., Some implications of CP invariance for mixing of Majorana neutrinos, Nuclear Physics B, 247, 1, pp. 61-69, (1984); Kayser, Boris J., CPT, CP, and C phases, and their effects, in majorana-particle processes, Physical Review D, 30, 5, pp. 1023-1033, (1984); Fogli, Gianluigi, Global analysis of neutrino masses, mixings, and phases: Entering the era of leptonic CP violation searches, Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology, 86, 1, (2012)","","Proceedings of Science (PoS)","","15th International Workshop on Neutrino Telescopes, Neutel 2013","","Venice","122015","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977111010"

Biodiversity conservation planning and accurate estimation of forest carbon fluxes and pools need more accurate information about forest area, spatial distribution and fragmentation. However, the recent forest maps of Southeast Asia were generated from optical images at spatial resolutions of several hundreds of meters, and they do not capture well the exceptionally complex and dynamic environments in Southeast Asia. The forest area estimates from those maps vary substantially, ranging from 1.73x106 km2 (GlobCover) to 2.69x106 km2 (MCD12Q1) in 2009; and their uncertainty is constrained by frequent cloud cover and coarse spatial resolution. Recently, cloud-free imagery from the Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) became available. We used the PALSAR 50-m orthorectified mosaic imagery in 2009 to generate a forest cover map of Southeast Asia at 50-m spatial resolution. The validation, using ground-reference data collected from the Geo-Referenced Field Photo Library and high-resolution images in Google Earth, showed that our forest map has a reasonably high accuracy (producer's accuracy 86% and user's accuracy 93%). The PALSAR-based forest area estimates in 2009 are significantly correlated with those from GlobCover and MCD12Q1 at national and subnational scales but differ in some regions at the pixel scale due to different spatial resolutions, forest definitions, and algorithms. The resultant 50-m forest map was used to quantify forest fragmentation and it revealed substantial details of forest fragmentation. This new 50-m map of tropical forests could serve as a baseline map for forest resource inventory, deforestation monitoring, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) implementation, and biodiversity. © 2014 Dong et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy; Article; Asia; Controlled Study; Forest Fragmentation; Geographic Mapping; Intermethod Comparison; Quantitative Analysis; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Tropical Rain Forest; Algorithm; Biodiversity; Biomass; Crop; Environmental Protection; Forest; Geographic Information System; Geography; Growth, Development And Aging; Procedures; Reproducibility; Southeast Asia; Statistics And Numerical Data; Telecommunication; Theoretical Model; Tropic Climate; Algorithms; Asia, Southeastern; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Forests; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Radar; Remote Sensing Technology; Reproducibility Of Results; Tropical Climate","accuracy; article; Asia; controlled study; forest fragmentation; geographic mapping; intermethod comparison; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; tropical rain forest; algorithm; biodiversity; biomass; crop; environmental protection; forest; geographic information system; geography; growth, development and aging; procedures; reproducibility; Southeast Asia; statistics and numerical data; telecommunication; theoretical model; tropic climate; Algorithms; Asia, Southeastern; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Forests; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Radar; Remote Sensing Technology; Reproducibility of Results; Tropical Climate","","","","Pimm, Stuart L., Extinction by numbers, Nature, 403, 6772, pp. 843-845, (2000); Fearnside, Philip Martin, Global warming and tropical land-use change: Greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning, decomposition and soils in forest conversion, shifting cultivation and secondary vegetation, Climatic Change, 46, 1-2, pp. 115-158, (2000); Faostat Database on Population, (2013); Stibig, Hans Jürgen, A new forest cover map of continental southeast Asia derived from SPOT-VEGETATION satellite imagery, Applied Vegetation Science, 7, 2, pp. 153-162, (2004); Skole, David L., Tropical deforestation and habitat fragmentation in the amazon: Satellite data from 1978 to 1988, Science, 260, 5116, pp. 1905-1910, (1993); Achard, Frédéric, Determination of deforestation rates of the world's humid tropical forests, Science, 297, 5583, pp. 999-1002, (2002); Margono, Belinda Arunarwati, Mapping and monitoring deforestation and forest degradation in Sumatra (Indonesia) using Landsat time series data sets from 1990 to 2010, Environmental Research Letters, 7, 3, (2012); FAO Forestry Paper 140, (2001); Meyfroidt, Patrick, Forest transition in Vietnam and displacement of deforestation abroad, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106, 38, pp. 16139-16144, (2009); Koh, Lian Pin, Remotely sensed evidence of tropical peatland conversion to oil palm, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108, 12, pp. 5127-5132, (2011)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24465714","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899884487"

Both SL-deficient and SL-response [more axillary growth (max)]mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to drought and salt stress,which was associated with shoot- rather than root-related traits.Exogenous SL treatment rescued the drought-sensitive phenotypeof the SL-deficient mutants but not of the SL-response mutant,and enhanced drought tolerance of WT plants, confirming the roleof SL as a positive regulator in stress response. In agreement withthe drought-sensitive phenotype, maxmutants exhibited increasedleaf stomatal density relative to WT and slower abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. Compared with WT, the max mutantsexhibited increased leaf water loss rate during dehydration anddecreased ABA responsiveness during germination and postgermi-nation. Collectively, these results indicate that cross-talk betweenSL and ABA plays an important role in integrating stress signals toregulate stomatal development and function. Additionally, a comparative microarray analysis of the leaves of the SL-response max2mutant and WT plants under normal and dehydrative conditionsrevealed an SL-mediated network controlling plant responses tostress via many stress- and/or ABA-responsive and cytokinin metabolism-related genes. Our results demonstrate that plants integrate multiple hormone-response pathways for adaptation toenvironmental stress. Based on our results, genetic modulation ofSL content/response could be applied as a potential approach toreduce the negative impact of abiotic stress on crop productivity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hormonal Regulation; Plant Adaptation; Transcriptome Analysis; Carotenoid; Cytokinin; Strigolactone; Transcriptome; Unclassified Drug; Abiotic Stress; Arabidopsis; Article; Drought Stress; Drought Tolerance; Gene Expression; Germination; Leaf Water Potential; Microarray Analysis; Nonhuman; Osmotic Stress; Phenotype; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Plant Stoma; Priority Journal; Root Growth; Salinity; Salt Stress; Signal Transduction; Hormonal Regulation; Plant Adaptation; Transcriptome Analysis; Abscisic Acid; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germination; Lactones; Microarray Analysis; Plant Roots; Plant Stomata; Salinity; Stress, Physiological","carotenoid; cytokinin; strigolactone; transcriptome; unclassified drug; abiotic stress; Arabidopsis; article; drought stress; drought tolerance; gene expression; germination; leaf water potential; microarray analysis; nonhuman; osmotic stress; phenotype; plant growth; plant leaf; plant stoma; priority journal; root growth; salinity; salt stress; signal transduction; hormonal regulation; plant adaptation; transcriptome analysis; Abscisic Acid; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germination; Lactones; Microarray Analysis; Plant Roots; Plant Stomata; Salinity; Stress, Physiological","","","","Xie, Xiaonan, The strigolactone story, Annual Review of Phytopathology, 48, pp. 93-117, (2010); Ruyter-Spira, Carolien P., The biology of strigolactones, Trends in Plant Science, 18, 2, pp. 72-83, (2013); Akiyama, Kohki, Plant sesquiterpenes induce hyphal branching in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Nature, 435, 7043, pp. 824-827, (2005); Umehara, Mikihisa, Inhibition of shoot branching by new terpenoid plant hormones, Nature, 455, 7210, pp. 195-200, (2008); Gomez Roldan, Maria Victoria, Strigolactone inhibition of shoot branching, Nature, 455, 7210, pp. 189-194, (2008); Alder, Adrian, The path from β-carotene to carlactone, a strigolactone-like plant hormone, Science, 335, 6074, pp. 1348-1351, (2012); Ha, Sukbong, Cytokinins: Metabolism and function in plant adaptation to environmental stresses, Trends in Plant Science, 17, 3, pp. 172-179, (2012); Choudhary, Sikander Pal, Benefits of brassinosteroid crosstalk, Trends in Plant Science, 17, 10, pp. 594-605, (2012); Fujita, Yasunari, ABA-mediated transcriptional regulation in response to osmotic stress in plants, Journal of Plant Research, 124, 4, pp. 509-525, (2011); Manavalan, Lakshmi Praba, Physiological and molecular approaches to improve drought resistance in soybean, Plant and Cell Physiology, 50, 7, pp. 1260-1276, (2009)","","","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","24379380","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892589903"

Rice is by no means a 'one size fits all' crop. Regional preferences are not only striking, they drive the market and hence are of major economic importance in any rice breeding / improvement strategy. In this analysis, we have engaged local experts across the world to perform a full assessment of all the major rice quality trait characteristics and importantly, to determine how these are combined in the most preferred varieties for each of their regions. Physical as well as biochemical characteristics have been monitored and this has resulted in the identification of no less than 18 quality trait combinations. This complexity immediately reveals the extent of the specificity of consumer preference. Nevertheless, further assessment of these combinations at the variety level reveals that several groups still comprise varieties which consumers can readily identify as being different. This emphasises the shortcomings in the current tools we have available to assess rice quality and raises the issue of how we might correct for this in the future. Only with additional tools and research will we be able to define directed strategies for rice breeding which are able to combine important agronomic features with the demands of local consumers for specific quality attributes and hence, design new, improved crop varieties which will be awarded success in the global market. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amylose; Amylose; Agronomic Trait; Aroma; Article; Biochemistry; Biodiversity; Carbohydrate Analysis; Consumer; Crop Improvement; Gelatinization; Grain; Grain (structure); Nonhuman; Plant Breeding; Plant Identification; Plant Structures; Rice; Amylose; Breeding; Climate; Internationality; Odors; Oryza Sativa; Temperature","amylose; agronomic trait; aroma; article; biochemistry; biodiversity; carbohydrate analysis; consumer; crop improvement; gelatinization; grain; grain (structure); nonhuman; plant breeding; plant identification; plant structures; rice; Amylose; Breeding; Climate; Internationality; Odors; Oryza sativa; Temperature","","amylose, 9005-82-7","The authors thank the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the International Network for Quality Rice (INQR) for funding the survey of consumer preference.

Little is known about tenofovir-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) in HIV-infected Vietnamese with mean body weight of 55 kg. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors of CKD in this country. Design: Cross-sectional study was performed. Methods: Clinical data on HIV-infected Vietnamese cohort were collected twice a year. To evaluate the prevalence of CKD, serum creatinine was measured in 771 patients in October 2011 and April 2012. CKD was defined as creatinine clearance less than 60 ml/min at both time points. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with CKD Results: Tenofovir use increased in Vietnam from 11.9% in April 2011 to 40.3% in April 2012. CKD was diagnosed in 7.3%, of which 7% was considered moderate and 0.3% was severe. Multivariate analysis of October-2011 data identified age per year-increase (OR: 1.229, 95%CI, 1.170-1.291), body weight per 1 kg-decrement (1.286, 1.193-1.386), and tenofovir use (2.715, 1.028-7.168) as risk factors for CKD. Conclusions: Older age, low body weight and tenofovir use were independent risk factors for CKD in Vietnam. Further longitudinal study is required to evaluate the impact of TDF on renal function in Vietnam and other countries with small-body weight patients. © 2013 Mizushima et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Creatinine; Lopinavir; Tenofovir; Zidovudine; Antiretrovirus Agent; Creatinine; Lopinavir; Tenofovir; Zidovudine; Adult; Age Distribution; Antiviral Therapy; Article; Chronic Kidney Disease; Controlled Study; Creatinine Blood Level; Creatinine Clearance; Disease Severity; Drug Safety; Drug Use; Ethnic Group; Female; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patient; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Major Clinical Study; Male; Pathogenesis; Practice Guideline; Risk Factor; Vietnamese; Weight Gain; World Health Organization; Adenine; Adult; Anti-hiv Agents; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organophosphonates; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Vietnam","antiretrovirus agent; creatinine; lopinavir; tenofovir; zidovudine; adult; age distribution; antiviral therapy; article; chronic kidney disease; controlled study; creatinine blood level; creatinine clearance; disease severity; drug safety; drug use; ethnic group; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; pathogenesis; practice guideline; risk factor; Vietnamese; weight gain; world health organization; Adenine; Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organophosphonates; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Vietnam","","creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; tenofovir, 147127-19-3, 147127-20-6; zidovudine, 30516-87-1","","Wyatt, Christina M., Chronic kidney disease in HIV infection: An urban epidemic, AIDS, 21, 15, pp. 2101-2103, (2007); Mocroft, Amanda J., Chronic renal failure among HIV-1-infected patients, AIDS, 21, 9, pp. 1119-1127, (2007); Palella, Frank Joseph, Mortality in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era: Changing causes of death and disease in the HIV outpatient study, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (1999), 43, 1, pp. 27-34, (2006); Michaels, Stephanie H., Declining morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection [1], New England Journal of Medicine, 339, 6, pp. 405-406, (1998); Gardner, Lytt Irvine, Rates and Risk Factors for Condition-Specific Hospitalizations in HIV-Infected and Uninfected Women, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (1999), 34, 3, pp. 320-330, (2003); Déti, Edouard Kossi, Prevalence and factors associated with renal impairment in HIV-infected patients, ANRS C03 Aquitaine Cohort, France, HIV Medicine, 11, 5, pp. 308-317, (2010); Overton, Edgar Turner, Factors associated with renal dysfunction within an urban HIV-infected cohort in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV Medicine, 10, 6, pp. 343-350, (2009); Lucas, Gregory M., Chronic kidney disease incidence, and progression to end-stage renal disease, in HIV-infected individuals: A tale of two races, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 197, 11, pp. 1548-1557, (2008); Menezes, Andréia Magalhães, Prevalence and risk factors associated to chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients on HAART and undetectable viral load in Brazil, PLOS ONE, 6, 10, (2011); Crum-Cianflone, Nancy F., Prevalence and factors associated with renal dysfunction among HIV-infected patients, AIDS Patient Care and STDs, 24, 6, pp. 353-360, (2010)","","","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24223203","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892383239"

Any progress will support knowledge discovery and linkage to other resources. However because of their wide variation a number of challenges still remain in terms of their identification and semantic normalisation before they can be fully exploited for research purposes.This paper presents novel techniques for identifying potential complex phenotype mentions by exploiting a hybrid model based on machine learning, rules and dictionary matching. A systematic study is made of how to combine sequence labels from these modules as well as the merits of various ontological resources. We evaluated our approach on a subset of Medline abstracts cited by the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man database related to auto-immune diseases.Using partial matching the best micro-averaged F-score for phenotypes and five other entity classes was 79.9%. A best performance of 75.3% was achieved for phenotype candidates using all semantics resources. We observed the advantage of using SVM-based learn-to-rank for sequence label combination over maximum entropy and a priority list approach. The results indicate that the identification of simple entity types such as chemicals and genes are robustly supported by single semantic resources, whereas phenotypes require combinations.

CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) count, plasma viral load (VL), and patient characteristics were analysed. The results were compared between 4 groups divided by the baseline CD4 values at the 25, 50 (median), and 75 percentiles.Findings:Over three-quarters of the subjects reported heterosexual contact as the probable route of transmission. After 12 months of ART, CD4 recovery varied between the 4 groups (P < 0.001), but VL sharply declined regardless of the baseline CD4 count (P = 0.136). Although this VL decline indicates the potency of ART as an HIV-1 prevention tool, the time between positive diagnosis and ART initiation suggests serious delay in both diagnosis and treatment; the medians of periods for the lowest and highest baseline CD4 quartiles were 1.2 and 9.6 months, respectively.Conclusion:Current limitations in VL determination make it difficult to assess the efficacy of initial ART, and delays in diagnosis and treatment suggest that subjects contributed to HIV-1 transmission while they were not receiving ART. The current National Free ART scheme does not provide free treatment for sexually transmitted infection (STI), and there is no link between ART and the STI care delivery system. This may interfere with the HIV-1 preventive potency of ART. We highly recommend establishing a collaborating mechanism with STI care, strengthening the VL determination system, and promoting HIV tests and early ART initiation. © 2013 Xia et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antiretrovirus Agent; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteinase Inhibitor; Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor; Rna Directed Dna Polymerase Inhibitor; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy; Antiviral Therapy; Article; Cd4 Lymphocyte Count; China; Controlled Study; Delayed Diagnosis; Drug Potency; Female; Heterosexuality; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Infection; Longitudinal Study; Major Clinical Study; Male; Sexual Transmission; Therapy Delay; Virus Load; Virus Transmission; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adult; Anti-hiv Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Treatment Outcome","antiretrovirus agent; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase inhibitor; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; adult; antiretroviral therapy; antiviral therapy; article; CD4 lymphocyte count; China; controlled study; delayed diagnosis; drug potency; female; heterosexuality; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; sexual transmission; therapy delay; virus load; virus transmission; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Treatment Outcome","","","","Estimates for the HIV AIDS Epidemic in China, (2015); Granich, Reuben M., Antiretroviral therapy in prevention of HIV and TB: Update on current research efforts, Current HIV Research, 9, 6, pp. 446-469, (2011); Yao, Xu, Rising epidemic of HIV-1 infections among general populations in Fujian, China, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (1999), 60, 3, pp. 328-335, (2012); Chin J AIDS STD Chin, (2005); Straits Science, (2007); China S Action Plan for Reducing and Preventing the Spread of HIV AIDS 2006 2010, (2006); China Free Art Manual, (2005); Garnett, Geoff Peter, Treatment as prevention: Translating efficacy trial results to population effectiveness, Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS, 7, 2, pp. 157-163, (2012); Cohen, Myron S., Prevention of HIV-1 infection with early antiretroviral therapy, New England Journal of Medicine, 365, 6, pp. 493-505, (2011); Bulletin Des Medecins Suisses, (2008)","","","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24086744","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884561471"

We investigated the status of drug resistance, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, and possible risk factors among newly diagnosed TB patients in Hanoi, the capital of Viet Nam. Methods:Clinical and epidemiological information was collected from 506 newly diagnosed patients with sputum smear- and culture-positive TB, and 489 (96.6%) MTB isolates were subjected to conventional drug susceptibility testing, spoligotyping, and 15-locus variable numbers of tandem repeats typing. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated to analyze the risk factors for primary drug resistance. Results:Of 489 isolates, 298 (60.9%) were sensitive to all drugs tested. Resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, ethambutol, and MDR accounted for 28.2%, 4.9%, 28.2%, 2.9%, and 4.5%, respectively. Of 24 isolates with rifampicin resistance, 22 (91.7%) were MDR and also resistant to streptomycin, except one case. Factors associated with isoniazid resistance included living in old urban areas, presence of the Beijing genotype, and clustered strains [aOR = 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-4.35; 1.91, 1.18-3.10; and 1.69, 1.06-2.69, respectively). The Beijing genotype was also associated with streptomycin resistance (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.29-3.40). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection was associated with rifampicin resistance and MDR (aOR = 5.42, 95% CI 2.07-14.14; 6.23, 2.34-16.58, respectively). Conclusion:Isoniazid and streptomycin resistance was observed in more than a quarter of TB patients without treatment history in Hanoi. Transmission of isoniazid-resistant TB among younger people should be carefully monitored in urban areas, where Beijing strains and HIV coinfection are prevalent. Choosing an optimal treatment regimen on the basis of the results of drug susceptibility tests and monitoring of treatment adherence would minimize further development of drug resistance strains. © 2013 Hang et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethambutol; Isoniazid; Pyrazinamide; Rifampicin; Streptomycin; Ethambutol; Isoniazid; Pyrazinamide; Rifampicin; Streptomycin; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aging; Antibiotic Sensitivity; Article; Bacterium Culture; Bacterium Isolate; Controlled Study; Disease Transmission; Drug Resistant Tuberculosis; Female; Gene Locus; Genotype; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Major Clinical Study; Male; Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis; Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; Prevalence; Primary Drug Resistant Tuberculosis; Risk Factor; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Smoking Habit; Sputum Analysis; Sputum Smear; Tandem Repeat; Tuberculosis; Urban Area; Variable Number Of Tandem Repeat; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Antitubercular Agents; Coinfection; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Female; Genotype; Hiv Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-resistant; Vietnam; Young Adult","ethambutol; isoniazid; pyrazinamide; rifampicin; streptomycin; adolescent; adult; aged; aging; antibiotic sensitivity; article; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; controlled study; disease transmission; drug resistant tuberculosis; female; gene locus; genotype; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; prevalence; primary drug resistant tuberculosis; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking habit; sputum analysis; sputum smear; tandem repeat; tuberculosis; urban area; variable number of tandem repeat; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antitubercular Agents; Coinfection; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Female; Genotype; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; Vietnam; Young Adult","","ethambutol, 10054-05-4, 1070-11-7, 3577-94-4, 74-55-5; isoniazid, 54-85-3, 62229-51-0, 65979-32-0; pyrazinamide, 98-96-4; rifampicin, 13292-46-1; streptomycin, 57-92-1","","Global Tuberculosis Report 2012, (2012); Goble, Marian, Treatment of 171 Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Resistant to Isoniazid and Rifampin, New England Journal of Medicine, 328, 8, pp. 527-532, (1993); Zhang, Ying, Mechanisms of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, 13, 11, pp. 1320-1330, (2009); Faustini, Annunziata, Risk factors for multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Europe: A systematic review, Thorax, 61, 2, pp. 158-163, (2006); Suchindran, Sujit, Is HIV infection a risk factor for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis?

In Vietnam, the use of community-based information, education and communication (IEC) activities could be a sustainable strategy to improve food hygiene and food safety behaviors. This study thus examined the long-term impact of community-based IEC activities on food hygiene and food safety behaviors.Methods:In this longitudinal study, we interviewed caregivers of children aged between six months and four years in suburban Hanoi. Baseline data were collected in January 2006 (n = 125). After conducting IEC interventions, we collected a 1st set of evaluation data in January 2007 (n = 132). To examine the long-term impact of the interventions, we then collected a 2nd set of evaluation data in January 2008 (n = 185). Changes in childhood diarrhea prevalence, IEC coverage, and food hygiene and food safety behaviors were assessed over a two-year period using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. Effective IEC channels were determined through multiple linear regression analysis.Results:Childhood diarrhea was significantly reduced from 21.6% at baseline to 7.6% at the 1st post-intervention evaluation (P = 0.002), and to 5.9% at the 2nd evaluation. Among 17 food hygiene and food safety behaviors measured, a total of 11 behaviors were improved or maintained by the 2nd evaluation. Handwashing after toilet use was significantly improved at both evaluation points. Overall, 3 food safety behaviors and 7 food hygiene behaviors were found to have significantly improved at the 1st and at the 2nd evaluations, respectively. Flip chart communication administered by community groups was identified to be the most effective IEC channel for effecting behavior change (P = 0.018).Conclusions:Flip chart communication administered by community groups is effective for improving multiple food hygiene and food safety behaviors in sustainable ways, and should be included in water and health promotion programs. © 2013 Takanashi et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Article; Behavior Change; Child; Childhood Disease; Clinical Article; Community Care; Diarrhea; Female; Food Control; Food Hygiene; Food Safety; Hand Washing; Health Behavior; Health Education; Health Program; Human; Infant; Interpersonal Communication; Longitudinal Study; Male; Medical Information; Preschool Child; Prevalence; Viet Nam; Adult; Child, Preschool; Communication; Diarrhea; Female; Food Handling; Food Safety; Health Behavior; Health Education; Humans; Hygiene; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Vietnam; Young Adult","adult; article; behavior change; child; childhood disease; clinical article; community care; diarrhea; female; food control; food hygiene; food safety; hand washing; health behavior; health education; health program; human; infant; interpersonal communication; longitudinal study; male; medical information; preschool child; prevalence; Viet Nam; Adult; Child, Preschool; Communication; Diarrhea; Female; Food Handling; Food Safety; Health Behavior; Health Education; Humans; Hygiene; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Vietnam; Young Adult","","","","Diarrhoea Why Children are Still Dying and What can Be Done, (2009); Curtis, Val A., Review: Domestic hygiene and diarrhoea - Pinpointing the problem, Tropical Medicine and International Health, 5, 1, pp. 22-32, (2000); Motarjemi, Yasmine, Contaminated weaning food: A major risk factor for diarrhoea and associated malnutrition, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 71, 1, pp. 79-92, (1993); Feachem, Richard G.A., Interventions for the control of diarrhoeal diseases among young children: Promotion of personal and domestic hygiene, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 62, 3, pp. 467-476, (1984); Curtis, Val A., Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: A systematic review, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 3, 5, pp. 275-281, (2003); Water and Sanitation Indicators Measurement Guide, (1999); Lanata, Claudio Franco, Studies of food hygiene and diarrhoeal disease, International Journal of Environmental Health Research, 13, SUPPL. 1, pp. S175-S183, (2003); Five Keys to Safer Food Manual, (2006); Ejemot-Nwadiaro, Regina I., Hand washing for preventing diarrhoea, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 1, (2008); Information Education and Communication Lessons from the Past Perspectives for the Future, (2001)","","","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","23950978","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881526760"

Although various transcription factors and cytokines have been identified as key participants in T<inf>H</inf>17 generation, the role of microRNAs in this process is poorly understood. In this study, we found that expression of the microRNA (miR)-132/212 cluster is upregulated by AHR activation under T <inf>H</inf>17-inducing, but not regulatory T-inducing conditions. Deficiency of the miR-132/212 cluster prevented the enhancement of T<inf>H</inf>17 differentiation by AHR activation. We also identified B-cell lymphoma 6, a negative regulator of T<inf>H</inf>17 differentiation, as a potential target of the miR-212. Finally, we investigated the roles of the miR-132/212 cluster in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model of multiple sclerosis.Mice deficient in the miR-132/212 cluster exhibited significantly higher resistance to the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and lower frequencies of both TH1 and T<inf>H</inf>17 cells in draining lymph nodes. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism of AHR-dependent T<inf>H</inf>17 differentiation that depends on the miR-132/212 cluster. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Autoimmunity; Dioxin Receptor; Immune Regulation; Interleukin-17; Luciferases; Mirn132 Microrna, Mouse; Mirn212 Microrna, Mouse; Micrornas; Oligonucleotides; Proto-oncogene Proteins C-bcl-6; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Aromatic Hydrocarbon Receptor; Interleukin 17; Microrna; Microrna 132; Microrna 212; Protein Bcl 6; Unclassified Drug; Allergic Encephalomyelitis; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Autoimmunity; Controlled Study; Cytokine Production; Female; Gene Cluster; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Frequency; Gene Function; Helper Cell; Immunopathogenesis; Intracellular Signaling; Lymph Node; Lymphocyte Differentiation; Male; Mouse; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Receptor Upregulation; Regulator Gene; Th1 Cell; Th17 Cell; Dioxin Receptor; Immune Regulation; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cell Differentiation; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Regulation; Interleukin-17; Luciferases; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Micrornas; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oligonucleotides; Proto-oncogene Proteins C-bcl-6; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; T-lymphocytes, Helper-inducer","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; interleukin 17; microRNA; microRNA 132; microRNA 212; protein bcl 6; unclassified drug; allergic encephalomyelitis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; autoimmunity; controlled study; cytokine production; female; gene cluster; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; gene frequency; gene function; helper cell; immunopathogenesis; intracellular signaling; lymph node; lymphocyte differentiation; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; receptor upregulation; regulator gene; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; dioxin receptor; immune regulation; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cell Differentiation; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Regulation; Interleukin-17; Luciferases; Mice; Mice, Knockout; MicroRNAs; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oligonucleotides; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer","","Interleukin-17, 0; Luciferases, 1.13.12.-; MIRN132 microRNA, mouse, 0; MIRN212 microRNA, mouse, 0; MicroRNAs, 0; Oligonucleotides, 0; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6, 0; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon, 0","","Langrish, Claire L., IL-23 drives a pathogenic T cell population that induces autoimmune inflammation, Journal of Experimental Medicine, 201, 2, pp. 233-240, (2005); Bettelli, Estelle, Reciprocal developmental pathways for the generation of pathogenic effector TH17 and regulatory T cells, Nature, 441, 7090, pp. 235-238, (2006); Murphy, Craig A., Divergent Pro- and Antiinflammatory Roles for IL-23 and IL-12 in Joint Autoimmune Inflammation, Journal of Experimental Medicine, 198, 12, pp. 1951-1957, (2003); Chen, Zhi Jane, Signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulation in the control of Th17 differentiation, Seminars in Immunology, 19, 6, pp. 400-408, (2007); Quintana, Francisco J., Control of Treg and TH17 cell differentiation by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, Nature, 453, 7191, pp. 65-71, (2008); Veldhoen, Marc, The aryl hydrocarbon receptor links TH17-cell-mediated autoimmunity to environmental toxins, Nature, 453, 7191, pp. 106-109, (2008); Kimura, Akihiro, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates Stat1 activation and participates in the development of Th17 cells, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105, 28, pp. 9721-9726, (2008); Zhang, Fuping, Interactions among the transcription factors Runx1, RORγt and Foxp3 regulate the differentiation of interleukin 17-producing T cells, Nature Immunology, 9, 11, pp. 1297-1306, (2008); Huber, Magdalena, IRF4 is essential for IL-21-mediated induction, amplification, and stabilization of the Th17 phenotype, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105, 52, pp. 20846-20851, (2008); Schraml, Barbara Ursula, The AP-1 transcription factor Batf controls T H 17 differentiation, Nature, 460, 7253, pp. 405-409, (2009)","","","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","23818645","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880352166"

Recently, a few submicroscopic genomic rearrangements have been reported as novel genetic causes of 46,XY DSD.Methodology/Principal Findings:To clarify the role of cryptic rearrangements in the development of 46,XY DSD, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis for 24 genetic males with genital abnormalities. Heterozygous submicroscopic deletions were identified in three cases (cases 1-3). A ∼8.5 Mb terminal deletion at 9p24.1-24.3 was detected in case 1 that presented with complete female-type external genitalia and mental retardation; a ∼2.0 Mb interstitial deletion at 20p13 was identified in case 2 with ambiguous external genitalia and short stature; and a ∼18.0 Mb interstitial deletion at 2q31.1-32 was found in case 3 with ambiguous external genitalia, mental retardation and multiple anomalies. The genital abnormalities of case 1 could be ascribed to gonadal dysgenesis caused by haploinsufficiency of DMRT1, while those of case 3 were possibly associated with perturbed organogenesis due to a deletion of the HOXD cluster. The deletion in case 2 affected 36 genes, none of which have been previously implicated in sex development.Conclusions/Significance:The results indicate that cryptic genomic rearrangements constitute an important part of the molecular bases of 46,XY DSD and that submicroscopic deletions can lead to various types of 46,XY DSD that occur as components of contiguous gene deletion syndromes. Most importantly, our data provide a novel candidate locus for 46,XY DSD at 20p13. © 2013 Igarashi et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Adolescent; Ambiguous Genitalia; Article; Case Report; Child; Chromosome 9p; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Cryptorchism; Dmrt1 Gene; Gene; Gene Cluster; Gene Deletion; Gene Rearrangement; Gonadal Dysgenesis; Gonadectomy; Haploinsufficiency; Heterozygosity; Hoxd Gene; Human; Human Tissue; Hypogonadism; Hypospadias; Infant; Male; Mental Deficiency; Micropenis; Multiple Malformation Syndrome; Nucleotide Sequence; Preschool Child; Sex Differentiation Disorder; Short Stature; 46, Xy Disorders Of Sex Development; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Female; Gene Rearrangement; Genome, Human; Heterozygote; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sequence Deletion","adolescent; ambiguous genitalia; article; case report; child; chromosome 9p; comparative genomic hybridization; cryptorchism; DMRT1 gene; gene; gene cluster; gene deletion; gene rearrangement; gonadal dysgenesis; gonadectomy; haploinsufficiency; heterozygosity; hoxD gene; human; human tissue; hypogonadism; hypospadias; infant; male; mental deficiency; micropenis; multiple malformation syndrome; nucleotide sequence; preschool child; sex differentiation disorder; short stature; 46, XY Disorders of Sex Development; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Female; Gene Rearrangement; Genome, Human; Heterozygote; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sequence Deletion","GENBANK: FLJ35024, NR_026966, NR_046248","","","Achermann, John C., Disorders of Sex Development, pp. 868-934, (2011); Domenice, Sorahia, Mutations in the SRY, DAX1, SF1 and WNT4 genes in Brazilian sex-reversed patients, Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, 37, 1, pp. 145-150, (2004); Gijsbers, Antoinet C.J., Molecular karyotyping: From microscope to SNP arrays, Hormone Research in Paediatrics, 76, 3, pp. 208-213, (2011); Lee, Charlie Wah Heng, Copy number variations and clinical cytogenetic diagnosis of constitutional disorders, Nature Genetics, 39, 7S, pp. S48-S54, (2007); White, Stefan J., Copy number variation in patients with disorders of sex development due to 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, PLOS ONE, 6, 3, (2011); Ledig, Susanne, Array-CGH analysis in patients with syndromic and non-syndromic XY gonadal dysgenesis: Evaluation of array CGH as diagnostic tool and search for new candidate loci, Human Reproduction, 25, 10, pp. 2637-2646, (2010); Tannour-Louet, Mounia, Identification of De Novo copy number variants associated with human disorders of sexual development, PLOS ONE, 5, 10, (2010); Cooper, Gregory M., A copy number variation morbidity map of developmental delay, Nature Genetics, 43, 9, pp. 838-846, (2011); Raymond, Christopher S., Evidence for evolutionary conservation of sex-determining genes, Nature, 391, 6668, pp. 691-695, (1998); Ying, Ming, Nuclear import of human sexual regulator DMRT1 is mediated by importin-β, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Cell Research, 1773, 6, pp. 804-813, (2007)","","","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","23861871","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879949667"

Our recent studies showed increased toxicity by exposure to barium alone (≤700 μg/L) and coexposure to barium (137 μg/L) and arsenic (225 μg/L). The present edition of WHO health-based guidelines for drinking water revised in 2011 has maintained the values of arsenic (10 μg/L) and barium (700 μg/L), but not elements such as manganese, iron and zinc. Nevertheless, there have been very few studies on barium in drinking water and human samples. This study showed significant correlations between levels of arsenic and barium, but not its homologous elements (magnesium, calcium and strontium), in urine, toenail and hair samples obtained from residents of Jessore, Bangladesh. Significant correlation between levels of arsenic and barium in well drinking water and levels in human urine, toenail and hair samples were also observed. Based on these results, a high-performance and low-cost adsorbent composed of a hydrotalcite-like compound for barium and arsenic was developed. The adsorbent reduced levels of barium and arsenic from well water in Bangladesh and Vietnam to <7 μg/L within 1 min. Thus, we have showed levels of arsenic and barium in humans and propose a novel remediation system. © 2013 Kato et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arsenic; Barium; Calcium; Hydrotalcite; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Strontium; Zinc; Calcium; Arsenic; Barium; Calcium; Drinking Water; Magnesium; Strontium; Adsorbent; Arsenic; Barium; Calcium; Drinking Water; Hydrotalcite; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Strontium; Zinc; Well Water; Adult; Article; Bangladesh; Clinical Article; Concentration (parameters); Ecosystem Restoration; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hair Analysis; Health Hazard; Human; Male; Nail; Urinalysis; Viet Nam; Water Management; Water Pollution; World Health Organization; Adsorption; Chemistry; Hair; Mass Spectrometry; Urine; Adsorption; Arsenic; Barium; Calcium; Drinking Water; Hair; Humans; Magnesium; Mass Spectrometry; Nails; Strontium; Water Wells","adsorbent; arsenic; barium; calcium; drinking water; hydrotalcite; iron; magnesium; manganese; strontium; zinc; well water; adult; article; Bangladesh; clinical article; concentration (parameters); ecosystem restoration; environmental exposure; female; hair analysis; health hazard; human; male; nail; urinalysis; Viet Nam; water management; water pollution; world health organization; adsorption; chemistry; hair; mass spectrometry; urine; Adsorption; Arsenic; Barium; Calcium; Drinking Water; Hair; Humans; Magnesium; Mass Spectrometry; Nails; Strontium; Water Wells","","arsenic, 7440-38-2; barium, 7440-39-3; calcium, 14092-94-5, 7440-70-2; hydrotalcite, 12304-65-3; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; strontium, 7440-24-6; zinc, 14378-32-6, 7440-66-6; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; Arsenic; Barium; Calcium; Drinking Water; Magnesium; Strontium","","Marchiset-Ferlay, Nathalie, What is the best biomarker to assess arsenic exposure via drinking water?, Environment International, 39, 1, pp. 150-171, (2012); Sun, Guifan, Current research problems of chronic arsenicosis in China, Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition, 24, 2, pp. 176-181, (2006); Parvez, Faruque, Prevalence of arsenic exposure from drinking water and awareness of its health risks in a Bangladeshi population: Results from a large population-based study, Environmental Health Perspectives, 114, 3, pp. 355-359, (2006); Chowdhury, Uttam Kumar, Groundwater arsenic contamination in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, Environmental Health Perspectives, 108, 5, pp. 393-397, (2000); Effects of the Arsenic Contamination of Groundwater in Bangladesh Report Prepared for the Environment Division, (2004); Berg, Michael, Magnitude of arsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River Deltas - Cambodia and Vietnam, Science of the Total Environment, 372, 2-3, pp. 413-425, (2007); Argos, Maria, A prospective study of arsenic exposure from drinking water and incidence of skin lesions in Bangladesh, American Journal of Epidemiology, 174, 2, pp. 185-194, (2011); Some drinking-water disinfectants and contaminants, including arsenic., IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, 84, pp. 1-477, (2004); Wu, Meei Maan, Dose-response relation between arsenic concentration in well water and mortality from cancers and vascular diseases, American Journal of Epidemiology, 130, 6, pp. 1123-1132, (1989); Kato, Masashi, A redox-linked novel pathway for arsenic-mediated RET tyrosine kinase activation, Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, 110, 2, pp. 399-407, (2010)","","","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","23805262","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879258167"

Organisms evolved two distinct methionine sulfoxide reductase families (MSRA & MSRB) to repair oxidized methionine residues. We found that 5 MSRB genes exist in the soybean genome, including GmMSRB1 and two segmentally duplicated gene pairs (GmMSRB2 and GmMSRB5, GmMSRB3 and GmMSRB4). GmMSRB2 and GmMSRB4 proteins showed MSRB activity toward protein-based MetO with either DTT or thioredoxin (TRX) as reductants, whereas GmMSRB1 was active only with DTT. GmMSRB2 had a typical MSRB mechanism with Cys121 and Cys 68 as catalytic and resolving residues, respectively. Surprisingly, this enzyme also possessed the MSRB activity toward free Met-R-O with kinetic parameters similar to those reported for fRMSR from Escherichia coli, an enzyme specific for free Met-R-O. Overexpression of GmMSRB2 or GmMSRB4 in the yeast cytosol supported the growth of the triple MSRA/MSRB/fRMSR (Δ3MSRs) mutant on MetO and protected cells against H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced stress. Taken together, our data reveal an unexpected diversity of MSRBs in plants and indicate that, in contrast to mammals that cannot reduce free Met-R-O and microorganisms that use fRMSR for this purpose, plants evolved MSRBs for the reduction of both free and protein-based MetO. © 2013 Le et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Dithiothreitol; Hydrogen Peroxide; Methionine; Methionine Sulfoxide; Thioredoxin; Methionine; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases; Methionine Sulfoxide; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase; Dithiothreitol; Hydrogen Peroxide; Methionine; Methionine Sulfoxide; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase A; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase B; Protein Gmmsrb2; Protein Gmmsrb4; Thioredoxin; Unclassified Drug; Vegetable Protein; Arabidopsis; Article; Cell Protection; Controlled Study; Cytosol; Enzyme Activity; Enzyme Analysis; Enzyme Kinetics; Enzyme Mechanism; Enzyme Polymorphism; Enzyme Specificity; Escherichia Coli; Gene Duplication; Gene Overexpression; Gmmsrb2 Gene; Gmmsrb3 Gene; Gmmsrb4 Gene; Gmmsrb5 Gene; Molecular Cloning; Molecular Evolution; Nonhuman; Oxidation; Oxidative Stress; Plant Gene; Plant Genome; Plant Growth; Plant Stress; Protein Family; Site Directed Mutagenesis; Soybean; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Plant; Genetic Variation; Methionine; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-directed; Plants; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, Dna; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Synteny; Yeasts; Glycine Max; Mammalia","dithiothreitol; hydrogen peroxide; methionine; methionine sulfoxide; methionine sulfoxide reductase A; methionine sulfoxide reductase B; protein GmMSRB2; protein GmMSRB4; thioredoxin; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; cell protection; controlled study; cytosol; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme kinetics; enzyme mechanism; enzyme polymorphism; enzyme specificity; Escherichia coli; gene duplication; gene overexpression; GmMSRB2 gene; GmMSRB3 gene; GmMSRB4 gene; GmMSRB5 gene; molecular cloning; molecular evolution; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; plant gene; plant genome; plant growth; plant stress; protein family; site directed mutagenesis; soybean; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Plant; Genetic Variation; Methionine; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Plants; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Synteny; Yeasts; Glycine max; Mammalia","","dithiothreitol, 3483-12-3; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; methionine, 59-51-8, 63-68-3, 7005-18-7; methionine sulfoxide, 454-41-1; thioredoxin, 52500-60-4; Methionine, AE28F7PNPL; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases, 1.8.4.-; methionine sulfoxide, 454-41-1; methionine sulfoxide reductase, 1.8.4.11","","Stadtman, Earl Reece, Oxidation of free amino acids and amino acid residues in proteins by radiolysis and by metal-catalyzed reactions, Annual Review of Biochemistry, 62, pp. 797-821, (1993); Stadtman, Earl Reece, Oxidation of Methionine Residues of Proteins: Biological Consequences, Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, 5, 5, pp. 577-582, (2003); Lee, Byung Cheon, The biological significance of methionine sulfoxide stereochemistry, Free Radical Biology and Medicine, 50, 2, pp. 221-227, (2011); Vogt, Walther, Oxidation of methionyl residues in proteins: Tools, targets, and reversal, Free Radical Biology and Medicine, 18, 1, pp. 93-105, (1995); Kwak, Geun-hee, Analyses of methionine sulfoxide reductase activities towards free and peptidyl methionine sulfoxides, Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 527, 1, pp. 1-5, (2012); Grimaud, Régis, Repair of oxidized proteins: Identification of a new methionine sulfoxide reductase, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 276, 52, pp. 48915-48920, (2001); Tarrago, Lionel, Methionine sulfoxide reductases preferentially reduce unfolded oxidized proteins and protect cells from oxidative protein unfolding, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 287, 29, pp. 24448-24459, (2012); Dos Santos, Christina Vieira, The Arabidopsis plastidic methionine sulfoxide reductase B proteins.

Aicda is strongly transcribed in activated B cells to diversify immunoglobulin genes, but expressed at low levels in various other cells in response to physiological or pathological stimuli. AID's mutagenic nature has been shown to be involved in tumor development. Here, we used a transgenic strategy with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to examine the in vivo functions of Aicda regulatory elements, which cluster in two regions: in the first intron (region 2), and approximately 8-kb upstream of the transcription start site (region 4). Deleting either of these regions completely abolished the expression of Aicda-BAC reporters, demonstrating these elements' critical roles. Furthermore, we found that selectively deleting two C/EBP-binding sites in region 4 inactivated the enhancer activity of the region despite the presence of intact NF-κB-, STAT6- and Smad-binding sites. On the other hand, selectively deleting E2F- and c-Myb-binding sites in region 2 increased the frequency of germinal-center B cells in which the Aicda promoter was active, indicating that E2F and c-Myb act as silencers in vivo. Interestingly, the silencer deletion did not cause ectopic activation of the Aicda promoter, indicating that Aicda activation requires enhancer-specific stimulation. In summary, precise regulation of the Aicda promoter appears to depend on a coordinated balance of activities between enhancer and silencer elements. © 2013 Huong et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Smad Protein; Aicda (activation-induced Cytidine Deaminase); Cytidine Deaminase; Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase; Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Protein; Protein C Myb; Smad Protein; Stat6 Protein; Transcription Factor E2f; Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase Gene; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Tissue; Article; B Lymphocyte; Bacterial Artificial Chromosome; Binding Site; Controlled Study; Enhancer Region; Gene Cluster; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Function; Germinal Center; In Vivo Study; Intron; Mouse; Mutational Analysis; Nonhuman; Promoter Region; Protein Expression; Protein Motif; Silencer Element; T Lymphocyte; Transcription Initiation Site; Animals; Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial; Cytidine Deaminase; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Introns; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Bacteria (microorganisms)","activation induced cytidine deaminase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; protein c Myb; Smad protein; STAT6 protein; transcription factor E2F; activation induced cytidine deaminase gene; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; B lymphocyte; bacterial artificial chromosome; binding site; controlled study; enhancer region; gene cluster; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; gene function; germinal center; in vivo study; intron; mouse; mutational analysis; nonhuman; promoter region; protein expression; protein motif; silencer element; T lymphocyte; transcription initiation site; Animals; Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial; Cytidine Deaminase; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Introns; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Bacteria (microorganisms)","","Smad protein, 62395-38-4; AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase), 3.5.4.-; Cytidine Deaminase, 3.5.4.5","","Muramatsu, Masamichi, Class switch recombination and hypermutation require activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a potential RNA editing enzyme, Cell, 102, 5, pp. 553-563, (2000); Révy, Patrick, Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency causes the autosomal recessive form of the hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2), Cell, 102, 5, pp. 565-575, (2000); Nagaoka, Hitoshi, Activation-induced deaminase (AID)-directed hypermutation in the immunoglobulin Sμ region: Implication of AID involvement in a common step of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, Journal of Experimental Medicine, 195, 4, pp. 529-534, (2002); Petersen, Simone, AID is required to initiate Nbs1/γ-H2AX focus formation and mutations at sites of class switching, Nature, 414, 6864, pp. 660-665, (2001); Liu, Man, Two levels of protection for the B cell genome during somatic hypermutation, Nature, 451, 7180, pp. 841-845, (2008); Kato, Lucia M., Nonimmunoglobulin target loci of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) share unique features with immunoglobulin genes, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 109, 7, pp. 2479-2484, (2012); Kotani, Ai, A target selection of somatic hypermutations is regulated similarly between T and B cells upon activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, 12, pp. 4506-4511, (2005); Yamane, Aarito, Deep-sequencing identification of the genomic targets of the cytidine deaminase AID and its cofactor RPA in B lymphocytes, Nature Immunology, 12, 1, pp. 62-69, (2011); Pavri, Rushad, Activation-induced cytidine deaminase targets DNA at sites of RNA polymerase II stalling by interaction with Spt5, Cell, 143, 1, pp. 122-133, (2010); Honjo, Tasuku, The AID Dilemma.

The mechanism of ART resistance is not clear; but the P. falciparum sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (PfSERCA or PfATP6) has been speculated to be the target of ARTs and thus a potential marker for ART resistance. Here we amplified and sequenced pfatp6 gene (~3.6 Kb) in 213 samples collected after 2005 from the Greater Mekong Subregion, where ART drugs have been used extensively in the past. A total of 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 8 newly found in this study and 13 nonsynonymous, were identified. However, these mutations were either uncommon or also present in other geographical regions with limited ART use. None of the mutations were suggestive of directional selection by ARTs. We further analyzed pfatp6 from a worldwide collection of 862 P. falciparum isolates in 19 populations from Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania, which include samples from regions prior to and after deployments ART drugs. A total of 71 SNPs were identified, resulting in 106 nucleotide haplotypes. Similarly, many of the mutations were continent-specific and present at frequencies below 5%. The most predominant and perhaps the ancestral haplotype occurred in 441 samples and was present in 16 populations from Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The 3D7 haplotype found in 54 samples was the second most common haplotype and present in nine populations from all four continents. Assessment of the selection strength on pfatp6 in the 19 parasite populations found that pfatp6 in most of these populations was under purifying selection with an average d<inf>N</inf>/d<inf>S</inf> ratio of 0.333. Molecular evolution analyses did not detect significant departures from neutrality in pfatp6 for most populations, challenging the suitability of this gene as a marker for monitoring ART resistance. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Artemisinin; Atp6 Protein, Plasmodium Falciparum; Antimalarials; Artemisinins; Calcium-transporting Atpases; Dna, Protozoan; Artemisinine; Artemisinin; Antimalarial Drug Resistance; Article; Controlled Study; Gene Frequency; Gene Sequence; Genetic Variability; Geographic Distribution; Haplotype; Molecular Evolution; Mutational Analysis; Mutator Gene; Natural Selection; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Parasite Isolation; Pfatp6 Gene; Plasmodium Falciparum; Sequence Analysis; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Antimalarials; Artemisinins; Asia, Southeastern; Calcium-transporting Atpases; Dna, Protozoan; Drug Resistance; Haplotypes; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; Mutation; Phylogeography; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic","artemisinin; antimalarial drug resistance; article; controlled study; gene frequency; gene sequence; genetic variability; geographic distribution; haplotype; molecular evolution; mutational analysis; mutator gene; natural selection; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; parasite isolation; pfatp6 gene; Plasmodium falciparum; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Antimalarials; Artemisinins; Asia, Southeastern; Calcium-Transporting ATPases; DNA, Protozoan; Drug Resistance; Haplotypes; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; Mutation; Phylogeography; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic","GENBANK: JN983286, JN983288, JN983289, JN983290, KC576980, KC576981, KC576982, KC576983, KC576984, KC576985, KC576986, KC576987, KC576988, KC576989, KC576990, KC576991, KC576992, KC576993, KC576994, KC576995, KC576996, KC576997, KC576998, KC576999, KC577000, KC577001, KC577002, KC577003, KC577004, KC577005, KC577006, KC577007, KC577008, KC577009, KC577010, KC577011, KC577012, KC577013, KC577014, KC577015, KC577016, KC577017, KC577018, KC577019, KC577020, KC577021, KC577022, KC577023, KC577024, KC577025, KC577026, KC577027, KC577028, KC577029, KC577030, KC577031, KC577032, KC577033, KC577034, KC577035, KC577036, KC577037, KC577038, KC577039, KC577040, KC577041, KC577042, KC577043, KC577044, KC577045, KC577046, KC577047, KC577048, KC577049, KC577050, KC577051, KC577052, KC577053, KC577054, KC577055, KC577056, KC577057, KC577058, KC577059, KC577060, KC577061, KC577062, KC577063, KC577064, KC577065, KC577066, KC577067, KC577068, KC577069, KC577070, KC577071, KC577072, KC577073, KC577074, KC577075, KC577076, KC577077, KC577078, KC577079, KC577080, KC577081, KC577082, KC577083, KC577084, KC577085, KC577086, KC577087, KC577088, KC577089, KC577090, KC577091, KC577092, KC577093, KC577094, KC577095, KC577096, KC577097, KC577098, KC577099, KC577100, KC577101, KC577102, KC577103, KC577104, KC577105, KC577106, KC577107, KC577108, KC577109, KC577110, KC577111, KC577112, KC577113, KC577114, KC577115, KC577116, KC577117, KC577118, KC577119, KC577120, KC577121, KC577122, KC577123, KC577124, KC577125, KC577126, KC577127, KC577128, KC577129, KC577130, KC577131, KC577132, KC577133, KC577134, KC577135, KC577136, KC577137, KC577138, KC577139, KC577140, KC577141, KC577142","artemisinin, 63968-64-9; ATP6 protein, Plasmodium falciparum, 3.6.3.8; Antimalarials, 0; Artemisinins, 0; Calcium-Transporting ATPases, 3.6.3.8; DNA, Protozoan, 0; artemisinine, 9RMU91N5K2","","World Malaria Report 2010, (2010); Nosten, François Henri, Artemisinin-based combination treatment of falciparum malaria, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 77, SUPPL. 6, pp. 181-192, (2007); Bosman, Andrea, A major transition in malaria treatment: The adoption and deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapies, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 77, SUPPL. 6, pp. 193-197, (2007); Feachem, Richard G.A., A new global malaria eradication strategy, The Lancet, 371, 9624, pp. 1633-1635, (2008); Mendis, Kamini N., From malaria control to eradication: The WHO perspective, Tropical Medicine and International Health, 14, 7, pp. 802-809, (2009); Dondorp, A.

Therefore, a vaccine that induces immunity against a broad spectrum of H5N1 viruses is preferable for pandemic preparedness. We established a second H5N1 vaccine candidate, A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/2007 (Vac-3), in our virus library and examined the efficacy of inactivated whole particles of this strain against two clades of H5N1 HPAIV strains that caused severe morbidity in cynomolgus macaques. Virus propagation in vaccinated macaques infected with either of the H5N1 HPAIV strains was prevented compared with that in unvaccinated macaques. This vaccine also prevented propagation of a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in macaques. In the vaccinated macaques, neutralization activity, which was mainly shown by anti-hemagglutinin antibody, against H5N1 HPAIVs in plasma was detected, but that against H1N1 virus was not detected. However, neuraminidase inhibition activity in plasma and T-lymphocyte responses in lymph nodes against H1N1 virus were detected. Therefore, cross-clade and heterosubtypic protective immunity in macaques consisted of humoral and cellular immunity induced by vaccination with Vac-3. © 2013 Nakayama et al. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gamma Interferon; Sialidase; Antibodies, Viral; Influenza Vaccines; Neuraminidase; Vaccines, Inactivated; Antibody; Gamma Interferon; Hemagglutinin Antibody; Inactivated Virus Vaccine; Influenza Vaccine; Unclassified Drug; Inactivated Vaccine; Sialidase; Virus Antibody; 2009 H1n1 Influenza; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Antiviral Activity; Article; Cellular Immunity; Cladistics; Controlled Study; Cytokine Production; Drug Efficacy; Drug Potency; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humoral Immunity; Influenza A (h5n1); Macaca Fascicularis; Morbidity; Nonhuman; Virus Immunity; Virus Load; Virus Neutralization; Virus Particle; Animal; Antagonists And Inhibitors; Antibody Production; Bird; Body Temperature; Human; Immunology; Influenza Virus A H1n1; Influenza Virus A H5n1; Influenza, Human; Metabolism; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Pandemic; Pathogenicity; Serodiagnosis; T Lymphocyte; Vaccination; Virology; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Antibody Formation; Birds; Body Temperature; Female; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1n1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H5n1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Neuraminidase; Neutralization Tests; Pandemics; T-lymphocytes; Vaccination; Vaccines, Inactivated; Viral Load","antibody; gamma interferon; hemagglutinin antibody; inactivated virus vaccine; influenza vaccine; unclassified drug; inactivated vaccine; sialidase; virus antibody; 2009 H1N1 influenza; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral activity; article; cellular immunity; cladistics; controlled study; cytokine production; drug efficacy; drug potency; female; flow cytometry; humoral immunity; influenza A (H5N1); Macaca fascicularis; morbidity; nonhuman; virus immunity; virus load; virus neutralization; virus particle; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; antibody production; bird; body temperature; human; immunology; Influenza virus A H1N1; Influenza virus A H5N1; Influenza, Human; metabolism; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; pandemic; pathogenicity; serodiagnosis; T lymphocyte; vaccination; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Antibody Formation; Birds; Body Temperature; Female; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Neuraminidase; Neutralization Tests; Pandemics; T-Lymphocytes; Vaccination; Vaccines, Inactivated; Viral Load","","gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; sialidase, 9001-67-6; Antibodies, Viral; Influenza Vaccines; Neuraminidase; Vaccines, Inactivated","","Sugita, Shigeo, Molecular evolution of hemagglutinin genes of H1N1 swine and human influenza A viruses, Journal of Molecular Evolution, 32, 1, pp. 16-23, (1991); Nidom, Chairul Anwar, Influenza a (H5N1) viruses from pigs, Indonesia, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 16, 10, pp. 1515-1523, (2010); Kida, Hiroshi, Origin of the hemagglutinin gene of H3N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China, Virology, 162, 1, pp. 160-166, (1988); Yasuda, Jiro, Molecular evidence for a role of domestic ducks in the introduction of avian H3 influenza viruses to pigs in southern China, where the A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) strain emerged, Journal of General Virology, 72, 8, pp. 2007-2010, (1991); Neumann, Gabriele G., Emergence and pandemic potential of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, Nature, 459, 7249, pp. 931-939, (2009); Kida, Hiroshi, Antigenic and genetic conservation of H3 influenza virus in wild ducks, Virology, 159, 1, pp. 109-119, (1987); Smith, Gavin J., Continued evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1): Updated nomenclature, Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses, 6, 1, pp. 1-5, (2012); Sakoda, Yoshihiro, Reintroduction of h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus by migratory water birds, causing poultry outbreaks in the 2010-2011 winter season in Japan, Journal of General Virology, 93, 3, pp. 541-550, (2012); Murakami, Shin, Cross-clade protective immunity of H5N1 influenza vaccines in a mouse model, Vaccine, 26, 50, pp. 6398-6404, (2008); Kida, Hiroshi, Library of influenza virus strains for vaccine and diagnostic use against highly pathogenic avian influenza and human pandemics, Developments in Biologicals, 124, pp. 69-72, (2006)","","","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24376571","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893507813"

However, information on the clinical and molecular characteristics of RSV infection in developing countries is limited. From April 2010 to May 2011, 1,082 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with ARI admitted to the Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Samples were screened for RSV and genotyped by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Demographic and clinical data was also recorded. RSV was found in 23.8% (257/1,082) of samples. RSV A was the dominant subgroup, accounting for 91.4% (235/257), followed by RSV B, 5.1% (13/257), and 9 cases (3.5%) were mixed infection of these subgroups. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all group A strains belonged to the GA2 genotype. All group B strains belonged to the recently identified BA genotype, and further clustered into 2 recently described subgenotypes BA9 and BA10. One GA2 genotype strain had a premature stop codon which shortened the G protein length. RSV infection was significantly associated with younger age and higher severity score than those without. Co-infection with other viruses did not affect disease severity. RSV A caused more severe disease than RSV B. The results from this study will not only contribute to the growing database on the molecular diversity of RSV circulating worldwide but may be also useful in clinical management and vaccine development. © 2013 Tran et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Guanine Nucleotide Binding Protein; Adolescent; Age; Article; Child; Disease Severity; Female; Genotype; Human; Human Tissue; Infant; Male; Mixed Infection; Molecular Epidemiology; Nucleotide Sequence; Phylogeny; Preschool Child; Respiratory Syncytial Pneumovirus; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection; School Child; Stop Codon; Throat Culture; Unindexed Sequence; Viet Nam; Virus Strain; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Molecular Epidemiology; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Viruses; Seasons; Vietnam; Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus; Respiratory Syncytial Virus; Rice Stripe Virus","guanine nucleotide binding protein; adolescent; age; article; child; disease severity; female; genotype; human; human tissue; infant; male; mixed infection; molecular epidemiology; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; preschool child; Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus; respiratory syncytial virus infection; school child; stop codon; throat culture; unindexed sequence; Viet Nam; virus strain; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Molecular Epidemiology; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Viruses; Seasons; Vietnam; Human respiratory syncytial virus; Respiratory syncytial virus; Rice stripe virus","GENBANK: AB175815, AB175819, AB175820, AB603467, AB603469, AB603474, AB603476, AB603478, AB603479, AF065254, AF065256, AF193325, AF233900, AF233901, AF233902, AF233903, AF233904, AF233905, AF233906, AF233909, AF233910, AF233913, AF233914, AF233915, AF233916, AF233917, AF233918, AF233920, AF233923, AF348803, AF348804, AF348807, AF348808, AF448498, AY114149, AY114151, AY146435, AY146437, AY472086, AY472094, AY524651, AY728167, AY751094, AY751105, AY751111, AY751117, AY751123, AY927401, AY927412, DQ227377, DQ227391, DQ227395, DQ227396, DQ227406, DQ248923, DQ289599, EU625712, FJ489656, HM459870, HM459876, HM459880, HM459883, HM459887, HM459888, HQ731741, JX079948, JX079949, JX079950, JX079951, JX079952, JX079953, JX079954, JX079955, JX079956, JX079957, JX079958, JX079959, JX079960, JX079961, JX079962, JX079963, JX079964, JX079965, JX079966, JX079967, JX079968, JX079969, JX079970, JX079971, JX079972, JX079973, JX079974, JX079975, JX079976, JX079977, JX079978, JX079979, JX079980, JX079981, JX079982, JX079983, JX079984, JX079985, JX079986, JX079987, JX079988, JX079989, JX079990, JX079991, JX079992, JX079993, M11486, Z33425","","We deeply thank Dr. Nguyen Tran Quynh Nhu and Ms. Pham Thi Ngoc Hue, Cardiovascular Department, Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City for their help in patient counseling and sample collection.

Since the half-life is only 7.2 × 105 year this is the obvious evidence of ongoing nucleosynthesis in our galaxy. This isotope is also known as an origin of abundance-anomaly of 26Mg observed in meteorites. Therefore, investigations of production rates for the 26gAl are quite important for the nucleosynthesis occurring in massive star, classical nova and super nova. Although there is still some uncertainties in the nuclear structure of 26Si which is located at the bypass sequence producing the isomeric state 26mAl (where m is expressing the metastable 1 st excited state). For the comprehensive understanding of the nuclear reaction rate to produce the 26gAl, we have done γ-ray spectroscopy to investigate the level structure for the 26Si. We confirmed the presence of a recently proposed level located just above the proton threshold. Furthermore, as a result of the gamma-ray angular correlation measurements we could assign the spin of this level as 0+. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Angular Correlations; Classical Novae; Isomeric State; Level Structure; Massive Stars; Milky Way Galaxy; Nuclear Structure; Production Rates; Galaxies; Gamma Rays; Isotopes; Nucleosynthesis; Silicon; Aluminum","Angular correlations; Classical novae; Isomeric state; Level structure; Massive stars; Milky way galaxy; Nuclear structure; Production rates; Galaxies; Gamma rays; Isotopes; Nucleosynthesis; Silicon; Aluminum","","","","Apj, (1984); A A, (1995); Diehl, Roland L., Radioactive 26Al from massive stars in the Galaxy, Nature, 439, 7072, pp. 45-47, (2006); José, Jordi, Nuclear uncertainties in the NeNa-MgAl cycles and production of 22Na and 26Al during nova outbursts, Astrophysical Journal, 520, 1 PART 1, pp. 347-360, (1999); Astrophys J, (1977); Iliadis, Christian, New stellar reaction rates for 25Mg(p,γ) 26Al and 25Al(p,γ) 26Si, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 53, 1, pp. 475-496, (1996); Eronen, Tommi, Mass and QEC value of Si26, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 79, 3, (2009); Parpottas, Yiannis, Astrophysically important 26Si states studied with the ( 3He,n) reaction and the25Al(p, γ)26Si reaction rates in explosive hydrogen burning environments, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 70, 6, pp. 0658051-0658059, (2004); Caggiano, Joseph A., Identification of new states in 26Si using the 29Si(3He,6He)26Si reaction and consequences for the 25Al(p,γ)26Si reaction rate in explosive hydrogen burning environments, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 65, 5, pp. 558011-558016, (2002); Bardayan, Daniel W., Astrophysically important 26Si states studied with the 28Si(p,t)26Si reaction, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 65, 3, pp. 328011-328014, (2002)","","","","12th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos, NIC 2012","","Cairns, QLD","100692","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081801152"

The reaction flow encounters a bottle-neck at 30S, owing to the competition of photo-disintegration with further proton capture, and because the half-life of this isotope is on the order of the burst rise timescale. Different burst simulations by various researchers indicate the (α,p) reaction may by-pass this waiting point, depending on the stellar reaction rate, which has not previously been measured experimentally, and the structure of the compound nucleus 34Ar is not well understood above the alpha-threshold. The 30S(α, p) reaction could explain rare bolometrically double-peaked burst profiles, appears to make a considerable contribution to the overall energy generation, and affects the neutron star crustal composition for the recurrent inertia required in burst models to reproduce astronomical observations. Using a low-energy 30S radioactive ion beam and an active target technique (a helium gas mixture serves as both a target gas and a detector fill gas), we acquired data on both alpha elastic scattering of 30S as well as the 30S(α, p) reaction simultaneously at relevant energies for X-ray bursts. We present for the first time the status of the data analysis and the preliminary results of this research. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Targets; Astronomical Observation; Crustal Composition; Energy Generations; Helium Gas Mixtures; Photo-disintegration; Radioactive Ion Beams; Stellar Reaction Rates; Bottles; Isotopes; Stars; X Rays","Active targets; Astronomical observation; Crustal composition; Energy generations; Helium gas mixtures; Photo-disintegration; Radioactive ion beams; Stellar reaction rates; Bottles; Isotopes; Stars; X rays","","","","Apjs, (1981); Parikh, Anuj R., The effects of variations in nuclear processes on type I X-ray burst nucleosynthesis, Astrophysical Journal, Supplement Series, 178, 1, pp. 110-136, (2008); Schatz, Hendrik, X-ray binaries, Nuclear Physics A, 777, pp. 601-622, (2006); Fisker, Jacob Lund, The nuclear reaction waiting points: 22Mg, 26Si, 30S, and 34Ar and bolometrically double-peaked type I X-ray bursts, Astrophysical Journal, 608, 1 II, pp. L61-L64, (2004); O'Brien, Shawn, Exploring the αp-process with Grand Raiden, AIP Conference Proceedings, 1090, pp. 288-292, (2009); Deibel, Catherine M., First measurement of the 33Cl(p,α)30S reaction, Physical Review C - Nuclear Physics, 84, 4, (2011); Kubono, Shigeru, New low-energy RIB separator CRIB for nuclear astrophysics, European Physical Journal A, 13, 1-2, pp. 217-220, (2002); Yanagisawa, Yoshiyuki, Low-energy radioisotope beam separator CRIB, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 539, 1-2, pp. 74-83, (2005); Sov J Nucl Phys, (1990); Yamaguchi, Hidetoshi, Development of a cryogenic gas target system for intense radioisotope beam production at CRIB, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment, 589, 2, pp. 150-156, (2008)","","","","12th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos, NIC 2012","","Cairns, QLD","100692","18248039","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887447993"

Thus, improved diagnostics are required to maximize treatment and minimize side effects and cost. Thirteen clinical decision rules have been reported to identify bacterial from viral meningitis. However, few rules have been tested and compared in a single study, while several rules are yet to be tested by independent researchers or in pediatric populations. Thus, simultaneous test and comparison of these rules are required to enable clinicians to select an optimal diagnostic rule for bacterial meningitis in settings and populations similar to ours. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Infectious Department of Pediatric Hospital Number 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The performance of the clinical rules was evaluated by area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) using the method of DeLong and McNemar test for specificity comparison. Results: Our study included 129 patients, of whom 80 had bacterial meningitis and 49 had presumed viral meningitis. Spanos's rule had the highest AUC at 0.938 but was not significantly greater than other rules. No rule provided 100% sensitivity with a specificity higher than 50%. Based on our calculation of theoretical sensitivity and specificity, we suggest that a perfect rule requires at least four independent variables that posses both sensitivity and specificity higher than 85-90%. Conclusions: No clinical decision rules provided an acceptable specificity (>50%) with 100% sensitivity when applying our data set in children. More studies in Vietnam and developing countries are required to develop and/or validate clinical rules and more very good biomarkers are required to develop such a perfect rule. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Anti-bacterial Agents; Biological Markers; Article; Bacterial Meningitis; Bonsu Clinical Rule; Briovet Clinical Rule; Chavanet Clinical Rule; Clinical Assessment Tool; Clinical Decision Making; Clinical Effectiveness; Cross-sectional Study; De Cauwer Clinical Rule; Diagnostic Accuracy; Differential Diagnosis; Ethnic Group; Freedman Clinical Rule; Hoen Clinical Rule; Human; Lussiana Clinical Rule; Mathematical Computing; Nigrovic Clinical Rule; Oostenbrink Clinical Rule; Practice Guideline; Predictive Value; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Reference Value; Retrospective Study; Schmidt Clinical Rule; Sensitivity And Specificity; Spanos Clinical Rule; Thome Clinical Rule; Tokuda Clinical Rule; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; Virus Meningitis; Adolescent; Anti-bacterial Agents; Area Under Curve; Biological Markers; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-sectional Studies; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Medicine; Male; Meningitis, Bacterial; Meningitis, Viral; Pediatrics; Retrospective Studies; Roc Curve; Sensitivity And Specificity; Vietnam; Bacteria (microorganisms)","article; bacterial meningitis; Bonsu clinical rule; Briovet clinical rule; Chavanet clinical rule; clinical assessment tool; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; cross-sectional study; De Cauwer clinical rule; diagnostic accuracy; differential diagnosis; ethnic group; Freedman clinical rule; Hoen clinical rule; human; Lussiana clinical rule; mathematical computing; Nigrovic clinical rule; Oostenbrink clinical rule; practice guideline; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; reference value; retrospective study; Schmidt clinical rule; sensitivity and specificity; Spanos clinical rule; Thome clinical rule; Tokuda clinical rule; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; virus meningitis; Adolescent; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Area Under Curve; Biological Markers; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Medicine; Male; Meningitis, Bacterial; Meningitis, Viral; Pediatrics; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vietnam; Bacteria (microorganisms)","","Anti-Bacterial Agents, 0; Biological Markers, 0","","Sáez-Llorens, Xavier J., Bacterial meningitis in children, The Lancet, 361, 9375, pp. 2139-2148, (2003); Zimmerli, Werner, How to differentiate bacterial from viral meningitis, Intensive Care Medicine, 31, 12, pp. 1608-1610, (2005); Wise, Richard, Antimicrobial resistance, BMJ, 317, 7159, pp. 609-610, (1998); Raymond, Josette, Epidemiology of nosocomial infections in pediatrics, Pathologie Biologie, 48, 10, pp. 879-884, (2000); Parasuraman, Trivandrum V., Enteroviral meningitis: Cost of illness and considerations for the economic evaluation of potential therapies, PharmacoEconomics, 19, 1, pp. 3-12, (2001); Haruda, Fred D., Meningitis - Viral versus bacterial [2] (multiple letters), Pediatrics, 112, 2 I, pp. 447-448, (2003); Dubos, François, Sensitivity of the Bacterial Meningitis Score in 889 Children with Bacterial Meningitis, Journal of Pediatrics, 152, 3, pp. 378-382, (2008); Dubos, François, Clinical decision rules to distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis, Archives of Disease in Childhood, 91, 8, pp. 647-650, (2006); Thome, J., Bacterial or virus meningitis?

In this study, we carried out microarray analysis of leaf tissues of soybean plants, which were subjected to drought stress from late vegetative V6 and from full bloom reproductive R2 stages. Our data analyses showed that out of 46093 soybean genes, which were predicted with high confidence among approximately 66000 putative genes, 41059 genes could be assigned with a known function. Using the criteria of a ratio change > = 2 and a q-value<0.05, we identified 1458 and 1818 upregulated and 1582 and 1688 downregulated genes in drought-stressed V6 and R2 leaves, respectively. These datasets were classified into 19 most abundant biological categories with similar proportions. There were only 612 and 463 genes that were overlapped among the upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, in both stages, suggesting that both conserved and unconserved pathways might be involved in regulation of drought response in different stages of plant development. A comparative expression analysis using our datasets and that of drought stressed Arabidopsis leaves revealed the existence of both conserved and species-specific mechanisms that regulate drought responses. Many upregulated genes encode either regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, including those with high homology to Arabidopsis DREB, NAC, AREB and ZAT/STZ transcription factors, kinases and two-component system members, or functional proteins, e.g. late embryogenesis-abundant proteins, glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases, defensins and glyoxalase I family proteins. A detailed analysis of the GmNAC family and the hormone-related gene category showed that expression of many GmNAC and hormone-related genes was altered by drought in V6 and/or R2 leaves. Additionally, the downregulation of many photosynthesis-related genes, which contribute to growth retardation under drought stress, may serve as an adaptive mechanism for plant survival. This study has identified excellent drought-responsive candidate genes for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant transgenic soybeans. © 2012 Le et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glycosidase; Glycosyltransferase; Lactoylglutathione Lyase; Plant Growth Regulators; Transcription Factors; Defensin; Glycosidase; Glycosyltransferase; Lactoylglutathione Lyase; Transcription Factor; Transcription Factor Areb; Transcription Factor Dreb; Transcription Factor Nac; Transcription Factor Stz; Transcription Factor Zat; Transcriptome; Unclassified Drug; Phytohormone; Arabidopsis; Article; Drought Stress; Embryo Development; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Function; Gene Sequence; Genetic Analysis; Genetic Regulation; Gmnac Gene; Growth Retardation; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Photosynthesis; Plant Development; Plant Gene; Plant Genome; Plant Leaf; Soybean; Survival; Transcriptomics; Transgenic Plant; Drought; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Genome-wide Association Study; Physiological Stress; Plant Root; Seedling; Shoot; Glycine Max; Droughts; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genome-wide Association Study; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Seedlings; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors","defensin; glycosidase; glycosyltransferase; lactoylglutathione lyase; transcription factor; transcription factor AREB; transcription factor DREB; transcription factor NAC; transcription factor STZ; transcription factor ZAT; transcriptome; unclassified drug; phytohormone; Arabidopsis; article; drought stress; embryo development; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic regulation; GmNAC gene; growth retardation; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; photosynthesis; plant development; plant gene; plant genome; plant leaf; soybean; survival; transcriptomics; transgenic plant; drought; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome-wide association study; physiological stress; plant root; seedling; shoot; Glycine max; Droughts; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Seedlings; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors","GENBANK: GSE40627","glycosidase, 9032-92-2; glycosyltransferase, 9033-07-2; lactoylglutathione lyase, 9033-12-9; Plant Growth Regulators; Transcription Factors","","Manavalan, Lakshmi Praba, Physiological and molecular approaches to improve drought resistance in soybean, Plant and Cell Physiology, 50, 7, pp. 1260-1276, (2009); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Functional genomics of soybean for improvement of productivity in adverse conditions, Functional and Integrative Genomics, 10, 4, pp. 447-462, (2010); Nguyen, Thao Phuong, Potentials toward genetic engineering of drought-tolerant soybean, Critical Reviews in Biotechnology, 32, 4, pp. 349-362, (2012); Crit Rev Biotechnol, (2012); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Functional analysis of AHK1/ATHK1 and cytokinin receptor histidine kinases in response to abscisic acid, drought, and salt stress in Arabidopsis, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, 51, pp. 20623-20628, (2007); Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko, Transcriptional regulatory networks in cellular responses and tolerance to dehydration and cold stresses, Annual Review of Plant Biology, 57, pp. 781-803, (2006); Valliyodan, Babu, Understanding regulatory networks and engineering for enhanced drought tolerance in plants, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 9, 2, pp. 189-195, (2006); Yang, Shujun, Narrowing down the targets: Towards successful genetic engineering of drought-tolerant crops, Molecular Plant, 3, 3, pp. 469-490, (2010); Hadiarto, Toto, Progress studies of drought-responsive genes in rice, Plant Cell Reports, 30, 3, pp. 297-310, (2011); Ma, Yun, Contribution of genomics to gene discovery in plant abiotic stress responses, Molecular Plant, 5, 6, pp. 1176-1178, (2012)","","","","","","","","19326203","","","23189148","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869765425"

Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) relating to avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection among residents in communities where H5N1 patients occurred in Vietnam has not been reported. Methods and Principal Findings: Face-to-face interviews including KAP survey were conducted in Bac Kan province, located in the northeast mountainous region of Vietnam. Participants were residents who lived in a community where H5N1 cases have ever been reported (event group, n = 322) or one where cases have not been reported (non-event group, n = 221). Data on emotional reactions of participants and healthcare-seeking behavior after the event in neighboring areas were collected as well as information on demographics and environmental measures, information sources, and KAP regarding H5N1. These data were compared between two groups. Higher environmental risk of H5N1 and improper poultry-handling behaviors were identified in the event group. At the time of the event, over 50% of the event group sought healthcare for flu-like symptoms or because they were scared. Awareness of the event influenced KAP scores. Healthcare-seeking behavior and attention to H5N1 poultry outbreaks diminished in the event group as time passed after the outbreak compared with the non-event group. Factors that motivated participants to seek healthcare sooner were knowledge of early access to healthcare and the risk of eating sick/dead poultry, and perception of the threat of H5N1. Conclusions: Awareness of H5N1 patients in neighboring areas can provoke panic in residents and influence their healthcare-seeking behavior. Periodic education to share experiences on the occurrence of H5N1 patients and provide accurate information may help prevent panic and infection and reduce mortality. Local conditions should be taken into account when emphasizing the need for early access to healthcare. © 2012 Manabe et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Adult; Article; Attitude To Illness; Awareness; Controlled Study; Emotionality; Epidemic; Feeding Behavior; Female; Flu Like Syndrome; Health Care Access; Health Education; Health Survey; Help Seeking Behavior; Human; Infection Risk; Influenza A (h5n1); Interview; Knowledge Attitude And Practice Survey; Major Clinical Study; Male; Poultry; Scoring System; Viet Nam; Adult; Animals; Awareness; Chickens; Ducks; Emotions; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5n1 Subtype; Influenza In Birds; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance Of Health Care; Poultry Diseases; Risk; Social Class; Vietnam","adult; article; attitude to illness; awareness; controlled study; emotionality; epidemic; feeding behavior; female; flu like syndrome; health care access; health education; health survey; help seeking behavior; human; infection risk; influenza A (H5N1); interview; knowledge attitude and practice survey; major clinical study; male; poultry; scoring system; Viet Nam; Adult; Animals; Awareness; Chickens; Ducks; Emotions; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Poultry Diseases; Risk; Social Class; Vietnam","","","","Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A H5n1 Reported to WHO, (2006); Manabe, Toshie, Impact of educational intervention concerning awareness and behaviors relating to avian influenza (H5N1) in a high-risk population in Vietnam, PLOS ONE, 6, 8, (2011); Hien, Tran Tinh, Avian Influenza A (H5N1) in 10 Patients in Vietnam, New England Journal of Medicine, 350, 12, pp. 1179-1188, (2004); Clinical Management of Human Infection with Avian Influenza A H5n1 Virus, (2007); Update on human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, 2010., Releve Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire, 86, 17, pp. 161-166, (2011); Adams, Sean C., Avian influenza: Update, Medical Principles and Practice, 19, 6, pp. 421-432, (2010); Pérez-Padilla, Rogélio, Pneumonia and respiratory failure from swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) in Mexico, New England Journal of Medicine, 361, 7, pp. 680-689, (2009); Bautista, Édgar G., Clinical aspects of pandemic 2009 influenza a (H1N1) virus infection, New England Journal of Medicine, 362, 18, (2010); Echevarría-Zuno, Santiago, Infection and death from influenza A H1N1 virus in Mexico: a retrospective analysis, The Lancet, 374, 9707, pp. 2072-2079, (2009); Dominguez-Cherit, Guillermo, Critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in Mexico, JAMA, 302, 17, pp. 1880-1887, (2009)","","","","","","","","19326203","","","23094063","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867688278"

We studied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to assess its suitability for detecting S. pneumoniae nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methodology/Principal Findings: We established an improved LAMP assay targeting the lytA gene (Streptococcus pneumoniae [Sp] LAMP). The analytical specificity of the primers was validated by using 32 reference strains (10 Streptococcus and seven non-Streptococcus species) plus 25 clinical alpha-hemolytic streptococcal strains, including four S. pneumoniae strains and 21 other strains (3 S. oralis, 17 S. mitis, and one Streptococcus species) harboring virulence factor-encoding genes (lytA or ply). Within 30 minutes, the assay could detect as few as 10 copies of both purified DNA and spiked CSF specimens with greater sensitivity than conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The linear determination range for this assay is 10 to 1,000,000 microorganisms per reaction mixture using real-time turbidimetry. We evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Sp LAMP assay using 106 randomly selected CSF specimens from children with suspected meningitis in Korea, China and Vietnam. For comparison, CSF specimens were also tested against conventional PCR and culture tests. The detection rate of the LAMP method was substantially higher than the rates of PCR and culture tests. In this small sample, relative to the LAMP assay, the clinical sensitivity of PCR and culture tests was 54.5% and 33.3%, respectively, while clinical specificity of the two tests was 100%. Conclusions/Significance: Compared to PCR, Sp LAMP detected S. pneumoniae with higher analytical and clinical sensitivity. This specific and sensitive LAMP method offers significant advantages for screening patients on a population basis and for diagnosis in clinical settings. © 2012 Kim et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Dna, Bacterial; N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine Amidase; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Strain; Bacterium Culture; Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis; Child; Controlled Study; Diagnostic Accuracy; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Diagnostic Value; Gene Dosage; Gene Targeting; Human; Intermethod Comparison; Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification; Lyta Gene; Major Clinical Study; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Ply Gene; Pneumococcal Meningitis; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Preschool Child; Sensitivity And Specificity; Streptococcus; Streptococcus Pneumoniae; Child, Preschool; Dna, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Infant; Meningitis, Pneumococcal; N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine Amidase; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Reproducibility Of Results; Sensitivity And Specificity","article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; child; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; gene dosage; gene targeting; human; intermethod comparison; loop mediated isothermal amplification; lytA gene; major clinical study; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; ply gene; pneumococcal meningitis; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; sensitivity and specificity; Streptococcus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Child, Preschool; DNA, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Infant; Meningitis, Pneumococcal; N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine Amidase; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","GENBANK: AE007317, AE007483, AE008540, AF467249, AJ252190, AJ252191, AJ252192, AJ252193, AJ252194, AJ252195, AJ252196, AJ617815, AJ617816, M13812","DNA, Bacterial, 0; N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine Amidase, 3.5.1.28","","Brown, Patricia D., Community-acquired pneumonia, The Lancet, 352, 9136, pp. 1295-1302, (1998); O'Brien, Katherine L., Burden of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in children younger than 5 years: global estimates, The Lancet, 374, 9693, pp. 893-902, (2009); Jacoby, George A., Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s, Annual Review of Medicine, 47, pp. 169-179, (1996); Whatmore, Adrian M., Genetic relationships between clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mitis: Characterization of 'atypical' pneumococci and organisms allied to S. mitis harboring S. pneumoniae virulence factor-encoding genes, Infection and Immunity, 68, 3, pp. 1374-1382, (2000); Salo, P.

Aiming to manipulate CK levels to improve drought tolerance of soybean cultivars through genetic engineering of CK metabolic genes, we surveyed the soybean genome and identified 14 CK biosynthetic (isopentenyltransferase, GmIPT) and 17 CK degradative (CK dehydrogenase, GmCKX) genes. Comparative analyses of GmIPTs and GmCKXs with Arabidopsis counterparts revealed their similar architecture. The average numbers of abiotic stress-inducible cis-elements per promoter were 0.4 and 1.2 for GmIPT and GmCKX genes, respectively, suggesting that upregulation of GmCKXs, thereby reduction of CK levels, maybe the major events under abiotic stresses. Indeed, the expression of 12 GmCKX genes was upregulated by dehydration in R2 roots. Overall, the expressions of soybean CK metabolic genes in various tissues at various stages were highly responsive to drought. CK contents in various organs at the reproductive (R2) stage were also determined under well-watered and drought stress conditions. Although tRNA-type GmIPT genes were highly expressed in soybean, cis-zeatin and its derivatives were found at low concentrations. Moreover, reduction of total CK content in R2 leaves under drought was attributable to the decrease in dihydrozeatin levels, suggesting a role of this molecule in regulating soybean's responses to drought stress. Our systematic analysis of the GmIPT and GmCKX families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under drought stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach. © 2012 Le et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Transfer Rna; Transferase; Zeatin; Cytokinins; Cis Acting Element; Cytokinin; Cytokinin Dehydrogenase; Isopentenyltransferase; Transfer Rna; Transferase; Unclassified Drug; Zeatin; Abiotic Stress; Arabidopsis; Article; Biotechnology; Cultivar; Cytokinin Gene; Dehydration; Developmental Stage; Drought Stress; Drought Tolerance; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Identification; Gene Structure; Genetic Manipulation; Gmckx Gene; Gmipt Gene; Multigene Family; Nonhuman; Plant Gene; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Plant Root; Promoter Region; Soybean; Upregulation; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Cytokinins; Droughts; Flowers; Fruit; Gene Duplication; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Order; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional; Seeds; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological","cis acting element; cytokinin; cytokinin dehydrogenase; isopentenyltransferase; transfer RNA; transferase; unclassified drug; zeatin; abiotic stress; Arabidopsis; article; biotechnology; cultivar; cytokinin gene; dehydration; developmental stage; drought stress; drought tolerance; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene structure; genetic manipulation; GmCKX gene; GmIPT gene; multigene family; nonhuman; plant gene; plant growth; plant leaf; plant root; promoter region; soybean; upregulation; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Cytokinins; Droughts; Flowers; Fruit; Gene Duplication; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Order; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional; Seeds; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological","","transfer RNA, 9014-25-9; transferase, 9047-61-4; zeatin, 1637-39-4; Cytokinins, 0","","Manavalan, Lakshmi Praba, Physiological and molecular approaches to improve drought resistance in soybean, Plant and Cell Physiology, 50, 7, pp. 1260-1276, (2009); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Functional genomics of soybean for improvement of productivity in adverse conditions, Functional and Integrative Genomics, 10, 4, pp. 447-462, (2010); Nguyen, Thao Phuong, Potentials toward genetic engineering of drought-tolerant soybean, Critical Reviews in Biotechnology, 32, 4, pp. 349-362, (2012); Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko, Transcriptional regulatory networks in cellular responses and tolerance to dehydration and cold stresses, Annual Review of Plant Biology, 57, pp. 781-803, (2006); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Functional analysis of AHK1/ATHK1 and cytokinin receptor histidine kinases in response to abscisic acid, drought, and salt stress in Arabidopsis, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, 51, pp. 20623-20628, (2007); Valliyodan, Babu, Understanding regulatory networks and engineering for enhanced drought tolerance in plants, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 9, 2, pp. 189-195, (2006); Yang, Shujun, Narrowing down the targets: Towards successful genetic engineering of drought-tolerant crops, Molecular Plant, 3, 3, pp. 469-490, (2010); Hadiarto, Toto, Progress studies of drought-responsive genes in rice, Plant Cell Reports, 30, 3, pp. 297-310, (2011); Jogaiah, Sudisha, Systems biology-based approaches toward understanding drought tolerance in food crops, Critical Reviews in Biotechnology, 33, 1, pp. 23-39, (2013); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Role of cytokinin responsive two-component system in ABA and osmotic stress signalings, Plant Signaling and Behavior, 5, 2, pp. 148-150, (2010)","","","","","","","","19326203","","","22900018","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865005183"

In this study, 210 mother-infant pairs in dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam were recruited at the infants' birth and followed up for 4 months. Perinatal dioxin exposure levels were estimated by measurement of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans toxic equivalent (PCDDs/Fs-TEQ) in breast milk. The infants' size was measured at birth and 1 and 4 months after birth, and neurodevelopment was evaluated using the Bayley Scales III at 4 months of age. Among 4 dioxin groups (<25, 25-50, 50-75, ≥75 percentile of PCDDs/Fs-TEQ), cross-sectional comparisons of body size and neurodevelopment scales and comparisons of longitudinally assessed body size were performed respectively. At birth, head circumference of girls in the ≥75 percentile group was significantly larger than those in the <25 and 50-75 percentile groups. At 4 months of age, the weight and body mass index (BMI) of boys in the ≥75 percentile group were significantly lower than those in the other groups. Increase in weight was significantly lower in the ≥75 percentile group in both sexes from birth to 1 month but only in boys at 1-4 months of age. Estimated marginal mean values in a mixed model of weight and BMI during the first 4 months of life were significantly lower in the ≥75 percentile group in boys. In girls, marginal mean values for head circumference were increased with increase in dioxin levels. Only in boys, cognitive, language, and fine motor scores in the ≥75 percentile group were significantly lower than those in the other groups.

To monitor the disease state, markers of metabolism and inflammation are potentially useful. We thus analyzed two major adipokines, adiponectin and leptin, and two other metabolic markers, fetuin-A and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4). Methods: The plasma levels of these markers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 84 apparently healthy individuals (= no-symptom group) and 46 patients with active pulmonary TB around the time of treatment, including at the midpoint evaluation (= active-disease group) and compared them with body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), chest radiographs and TB-antigen specific response by interferon-γ release assay (IGRA). Results: In the no-symptom group, adiponectin and leptin showed negative and positive correlation with BMI respectively. In the active-disease group, at the time of diagnosis, leptin, fetuin-A and RBP4 levels were lower than in the no-symptom group [adjusted means 2.01 versus 4.50 ng/ml, P<0.0001; 185.58 versus 252.27 μg/ml, P<0.0001; 23.88 versus 43.79 μg/ml, P<0.0001, respectively]. High adiponectin and low leptin levels were associated with large infiltrates on chest radiographs even after adjustment for BMI and other covariates (P = 0.0033 and P = 0.0020). During treatment, adiponectin levels increased further and then decreased. Leptin levels remained low. Initial low levels of fetuin-A and RBP4 almost returned to the normal reference range in concert with reduced CRP. Conclusions: Our data and recent literature suggest that low fat store and underlying inflammation may regulate these metabolic markers in TB in a different way. Decreased leptin, increased adiponectin, or this ratio may be a promising marker for severity of the disease independent of BMI. We should further investigate pathological roles of the balance between these adipokines. © 2012 Keicho et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","C Reactive Protein; Adiponectin; Ethambutol; Isoniazid; Pyrazinamide; Rifampicin; Streptomycin; Adiponectin; Biological Markers; C-reactive Protein; Leptin; Rbp4 Protein, Human; Retinol-binding Proteins, Plasma; Alpha-2-hs-glycoprotein; Adiponectin; Biological Marker; C Reactive Protein; Ethambutol; Fetuin A; Isoniazid; Leptin; Pyrazinamide; Retinol Binding Protein; Rifampicin; Streptomycin; Adult; Antigen Specificity; Article; Body Mass; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Disease Association; Disease Severity; Down Regulation; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Human; Interferon Gamma Release Assay; Lipid Storage; Lung Infiltrate; Lung Tuberculosis; Male; Protein Blood Level; Thorax Radiography; Upregulation; Adiponectin; Adult; Alpha-2-hs-glycoprotein; Analysis Of Variance; Biological Markers; Body Mass Index; C-reactive Protein; Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Leptin; Male; Middle Aged; Retinol-binding Proteins, Plasma; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary","adiponectin; biological marker; C reactive protein; ethambutol; fetuin A; isoniazid; leptin; pyrazinamide; retinol binding protein; rifampicin; streptomycin; adult; antigen specificity; article; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; interferon gamma release assay; lipid storage; lung infiltrate; lung tuberculosis; male; protein blood level; thorax radiography; upregulation; Adiponectin; Adult; alpha-2-HS-Glycoprotein; Analysis of Variance; Biological Markers; Body Mass Index; C-Reactive Protein; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Leptin; Male; Middle Aged; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; adiponectin, 283182-39-8; ethambutol, 10054-05-4, 1070-11-7, 3577-94-4, 74-55-5; isoniazid, 54-85-3, 62229-51-0, 65979-32-0; pyrazinamide, 98-96-4; rifampicin, 13292-46-1; streptomycin, 57-92-1; Adiponectin, 0; Biological Markers, 0; C-Reactive Protein, 9007-41-4; Leptin, 0; RBP4 protein, human, 0; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma, 0; alpha-2-HS-Glycoprotein, 0","","Tverdal, Aa, Body mass index and incidence of tuberculosis, European Journal of Respiratory Diseases, 69, 5, pp. 355-362, (1986); Schaible, Ulrich Emil, Malnutrition and infection: Complex mechanisms and global impacts, PLOS Medicine, 4, 5, pp. 0806-0812, (2007); Prentice, Andrew M., New challenges in studying nutrition-disease interactions in the developing world, Journal of Clinical Investigation, 118, 4, pp. 1322-1329, (2008); Cegielski, J.

Global systems have been established to monitor the evolution and impact of influenza viruses, yet regional analysis of surveillance findings has been limited. This study describes epidemiological and virological characteristics of influenza during 2006-2010 in the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region. Methodology/Principal Findings: Influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza virus data were obtained from the 14 countries with National Influenza Centres. Data were obtained directly from countries and from FluNet, the web-based tool of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. National influenza surveillance and participation in the global system increased over the five years. Peaks in ILI reporting appeared to be coincident with the proportion of influenza positive specimens. Temporal patterns of ILI activity and the proportion of influenza positive specimens were clearly observed in temperate countries: Mongolia, Japan and the Republic of Korea in the northern hemisphere, and Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and New Caledonia (France) in the southern hemisphere. Two annual peaks in activity were observed in China from 2006 through the first quarter of 2009. A temporal pattern was less evident in tropical countries, where influenza activity was observed year-round. Influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of viruses reported between 2006 and 2009, but an equal proportion of influenza A and influenza B viruses was detected in 2010. Conclusions/Significance: Despite differences in surveillance methods and intensity, commonalities in ILI and influenza virus circulation patterns were identified. Patterns suggest that influenza circulation may be dependent on a multitude of factors including seasonality and population movement. Dominant strains in Southeast Asian countries were later detected in other countries. Thus, timely reporting and regional sharing of information about influenza may serve as an early warning, and may assist countries to anticipate the potential severity and burden associated with incoming strains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Article; Australia; Child; Controlled Study; Disease Activity; Disease Surveillance; Epidemiology; Fiji; Flu Like Syndrome; Human; Influenza; Influenza Virus A; Influenza Virus B; Japan; Medical Information System; Mongolia; New Caledonia; New Zealand; Nonhuman; Northern Hemisphere; South Korea; Southern Hemisphere; Virus Characterization; Virus Detection; Virus Strain; World Health Organization; Influenza A Virus; Influenza B Virus; Orthomyxoviridae","adolescent; adult; aged; article; Australia; child; controlled study; disease activity; disease surveillance; epidemiology; Fiji; flu like syndrome; human; influenza; Influenza virus A; Influenza virus B; Japan; medical information system; Mongolia; New Caledonia; New Zealand; nonhuman; Northern Hemisphere; South Korea; Southern Hemisphere; virus characterization; virus detection; virus strain; world health organization; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; Orthomyxoviridae","","","","Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, (2004); Chiu, Susan Shui Seng, Virologically confirmed population-based burden of hospitalization caused by influenza a and b among children in Hong Kong, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 49, 7, pp. 1016-1021, (2009); Yang, Lin, Influenza associated mortality in the subtropics and tropics: Results from three Asian cities, Vaccine, 29, 48, pp. 8909-8914, (2011); undefined; Western Pacific Surveillance and Response Journal, (2010); Mardy, Sek, Influenza activity in Cambodia during 2006-2008, BMC Infectious Diseases, 9, (2009); Tang, Julian W., Comparison of the incidence of influenza in relation to climate factors during 2000-2007 in five countries, Journal of Medical Virology, 82, 11, pp. 1958-1965, (2010); Hampson, Alan William, Epidemiological data on influenza in Asian countries, Vaccine, 17, SUPPL. 1, pp. S19-S23, (1999); Shu, Yuelong, Dual seasonal patterns for influenza, China, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 16, 4, pp. 725-726, (2010); Chan, Paul Kay Sheung, Seasonal influenza activity in Hong Kong and its association with meteorological variations, Journal of Medical Virology, 81, 10, pp. 1797-1806, (2009)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","22675427","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861557817"

Here we provide evidence that the inhibitory co-receptor programmed cell death - 1 (PD-1) regulates the gut microbiota through appropriate selection of IgA plasma cell repertoires. PD-1 deficiency generates an excess number of T follicular helper (T<inf>FH</inf>) cells with altered phenotypes, which results in dysregulated selection of IgA precursor cells in the germinal center of Peyer's patches. Consequently, the IgAs produced in PD-1 - deficient mice have reduced bacteria-binding capacity, which causes alterations of microbial communities in the gut.

Recently, it has been reported that cytokinins (CKs) regulate plant environmental stress responses through two-component systems. A decrease in endogenous CK levels could enhance salt and drought stress tolerance. Here, we have investigated the global transcriptional change caused by a reduction in endogenous CK content under both normal and salt stress conditions. Ten-day-old Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (WT) and CK-deficient ipt1,3,5,7 plants were transferred to agar plates containing either 0 mM (control) or 200 mM NaCl and maintained at normal growth conditions for 24 h. Our experimental design allowed us to compare transcriptome changes under four conditions: WT-200 mM vs. WT-0 mM, ipt1,3,5,7-0 mM vs. WT-0 mM, ipt1,3,5,7-200 mM vs. ipt1,3,5,7-0 mM and ipt1,3,5,7-200 mM vs. WT-200 mM NaCl. Our results indicated that the expression of more than 10% of all of the annotated Arabidopsis genes was altered by CK deficiency under either normal or salt stress conditions when compared to WT. We found that upregulated expression of many genes encoding either regulatory proteins, such as NAC, DREB and ZFHD transcription factors and the calcium sensor SOS3, or functional proteins, such as late embryogenesis-abundant proteins, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylases, glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases, defensins and glyoxalase I family proteins, may contribute to improved salt tolerance of CK-deficient plants. We also demonstrated that the downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes and the upregulation of several NAC genes may cause the altered morphological phenotype of CK-deficient plants. This study highlights the impact of CK regulation on the well-known stress-responsive signaling pathways, which regulate plant adaptation to high salinity as well as other environmental stresses. © 2012 Nishiyama et al. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glycosidase; Glycosyltransferase; Lactoylglutathione Lyase; Sodium Chloride; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biological Markers; Cytokinins; Rna, Messenger; Sodium Chloride; Cytokinin; Defensin; Glycosidase; Glycosyltransferase; Lactoylglutathione Lyase; Late Embryogenesis Abundant Protein; Protein Dreb; Protein Nac; Protein Sos3; Protein Zfhd; Regulator Protein; Sodium Chloride; Transcription Factor; Transcriptome; Unclassified Drug; Xyloglucan Endo Transglycosylase; Arabidopsis Protein; Biological Marker; Messenger Rna; Arabidopsis; Article; Controlled Study; Down Regulation; Environmental Stress; Gene Expression; Microarray Analysis; Morphology; Mutant; Nac Gene; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Plant Gene; Promoter Region; Regulatory Mechanism; Salt Stress; Signal Transduction; Upregulation; Wild Type; Comparative Study; Dna Microarray; Drug Effect; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Halophyte; Metabolism; Physiological Stress; Physiology; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transgenic Plant; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biological Markers; Cytokinins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plants, Genetically Modified; Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna, Messenger; Salt-tolerant Plants; Sodium Chloride; Stress, Physiological","cytokinin; defensin; glycosidase; glycosyltransferase; lactoylglutathione lyase; late embryogenesis abundant protein; protein DREB; protein nac; protein SOS3; protein ZFHD; regulator protein; sodium chloride; transcription factor; transcriptome; unclassified drug; xyloglucan endo transglycosylase; Arabidopsis protein; biological marker; messenger RNA; Arabidopsis; article; controlled study; down regulation; environmental stress; gene expression; microarray analysis; morphology; mutant; NAC gene; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; photosynthesis; plant gene; promoter region; regulatory mechanism; salt stress; signal transduction; upregulation; wild type; comparative study; DNA microarray; drug effect; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; halophyte; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; real time polymerase chain reaction; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biological Markers; Cytokinins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plants, Genetically Modified; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Salt-Tolerant Plants; Sodium Chloride; Stress, Physiological","GENBANK: GSE32087","glycosidase, 9032-92-2; glycosyltransferase, 9033-07-2; lactoylglutathione lyase, 9033-12-9; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; Arabidopsis Proteins, 0; Biological Markers, 0; Cytokinins, 0; RNA, Messenger, 0; Sodium Chloride, 7647-14-5","","Shabala, Sergey Nikolayevich, Potassium transport and plant salt tolerance, Physiologia Plantarum, 133, 4, pp. 651-669, (2008); Tran, Lam Son Phan, Functional genomics of soybean for improvement of productivity in adverse conditions, Functional and Integrative Genomics, 10, 4, pp. 447-462, (2010); Sobhanian, Hamid, Changes in the plant proteome resulting from salt stress: Toward the creation of salt-tolerant crops?, Journal of Proteomics, 74, 8, pp. 1323-1337, (2011); Roy, Stuart John, Genetic analysis of abiotic stress tolerance in crops, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 14, 3, pp. 232-239, (2011); Ashraf, Muhammad, Improving salinity tolerance of plants through conventional breeding and genetic engineering: An analytical comparison, Biotechnology Advances, 27, 6, pp. 744-752, (2009); Ashraf, Muhammad, Biotechnological approach of improving plant salt tolerance using antioxidants as markers, Biotechnology Advances, 27, 1, pp. 84-93, (2009); Chinnusamy, Viswanathan, Salt stress signaling and mechanisms of plant salt tolerance., Genetic engineering, 27, pp. 141-177, (2006); Chen, Shaoliang, Salinity tolerance of Populus, Plant Biology, 12, 2, pp. 317-333, (2010); Munns, Rana E., Mechanisms of salinity tolerance, Annual Review of Plant Biology, 59, pp. 651-681, (2008); Yao, Dongxia, Transcriptome analysis reveals salt-stress-regulated biological processes and key pathways in roots of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), Genomics, 98, 1, pp. 47-55, (2011)","","","","","","","","19326203","","","22355415","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857084486"

Methods/Principal Findings: Novel educational programs including training and workshops for medical providers relating to H5N1 infection in Vietnam were originally created and implemented in 18 provincial hospitals in northern Vietnam between 2008 and 2010. A self-administered, structured questionnaire survey was conducted in 8 provincial hospitals where both educational training and workshops were previously provided. A total of 326 medical providers, including physicians, nurses, and laboratory technicians who attended or did not attend original programs were enrolled in the survey. Knowledge, clinical attitudes and practice (KAP), including motivation surrounding caring for H5N1 patients, were evaluated. The study indicated a high level of knowledge and motivation in all professional groups, with especially high levels in laboratory technicians. Conferences and educational programs were evaluated to be the main scientific information resources for physicians, along with information from colleagues. The chest radiographs and the initiation of antiviral treatment in the absence of RT-PCR result were identified as gaps in education. Factors possibly influencing professional motivation for caring for H5N1 patients included healthcare profession, the hospital where the respondents worked, age group, attendance at original educational programs and at educational programs which were conducted by international health-related organizations. Conclusions: Educational programs provide high knowledge and motivation for medical providers in Vietnam caring for H5N1 patients. Additional educational programs related to chest radiographs and an initiation of treatment in the absence of RT-PCR are needed. Networking is also necessary for sharing updated scientific information and practical experiences. These enhanced KAPs by educational programs and integrated systems among hospitals should result in appropriate care for H5N1 patients and may reduce morbidity and mortality. © 2012 Manabe et al. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Antiviral Therapy; Article; Clinical Competence; Clinical Practice; Controlled Study; Early Diagnosis; Early Intervention; Education Program; Female; Health Care Planning; Health Personnel Attitude; Human; Influenza A (h5n1); Integrated Health Care System; Male; Medical Education; Medical Information; Motivation; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Thorax Radiography; Viet Nam; Aged; Animal; Attitude To Health; Avian Influenza; Bird; Disease Transmission; Educational Status; Evaluation; Health Care Personnel; Influenza; Influenza Virus A H5n1; Middle Aged; Physiology; Professional Practice; Psychological Aspect; Questionnaire; Social Support; Statistics; Aves; Adult; Aged; Animals; Birds; Educational Status; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5n1 Subtype; Influenza In Birds; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Professional Practice; Questionnaires; Social Support; Vietnam; Young Adult","adult; antiviral therapy; article; clinical competence; clinical practice; controlled study; early diagnosis; early intervention; education program; female; health care planning; health personnel attitude; human; influenza A (H5N1); integrated health care system; male; medical education; medical information; motivation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thorax radiography; Viet Nam; aged; animal; attitude to health; avian influenza; bird; disease transmission; educational status; evaluation; health care personnel; influenza; Influenza virus A H5N1; middle aged; physiology; professional practice; psychological aspect; questionnaire; social support; statistics; Aves; Adult; Aged; Animals; Birds; Educational Status; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Professional Practice; Questionnaires; Social Support; Vietnam; Young Adult","","","","Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A H5n1 Reported to WHO, (2006); Adisasmito, Wiku Bakti Bawono, Effectiveness of antiviral treatment in human influenza A(H5N1) infections: Analysis of a global patient registry, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 202, 8, pp. 1154-1160, (2010); Shinde, Vivek M., A comparison of clinical and epidemiological characteristics of fatal human infections with H5N1 and human influenza viruses in Thailand, 2004-2006, PLOS ONE, 6, 4, (2011); Manabe, Toshie, Impact of educational intervention concerning awareness and behaviors relating to avian influenza (H5N1) in a high-risk population in Vietnam, PLOS ONE, 6, 8, (2011); Update on human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, 2010., Releve Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire, 86, 17, pp. 161-166, (2011); Hien, Tran Tinh, Avian Influenza A (H5N1) in 10 Patients in Vietnam, New England Journal of Medicine, 350, 12, pp. 1179-1188, (2004); Kandun, I.

Therefore, we investigated circulating DNA as a potential biomarker for severe dengue. Methods and Findings: A direct fluorometric degradation assay using PicoGreen was performed to quantify cell-free DNA from patient plasma. Circulating DNA levels were significantly higher in patients with dengue virus infection than with other febrile illnesses and healthy controls. Remarkably, the increase of DNA levels correlated with the severity of dengue. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that circulating DNA levels independently correlated with dengue shock syndrome.

Contact with infected poultry is known to be a significant risk factor for contraction of H5N1 infection. However, handling and encountering poultry are a part of most peoples' daily lives, especially in rural communities in Vietnam where epidemic outbreaks among poultry have been continuously reported. Enhancing proper knowledge relating to H5N1 and to the importance of early initiation of treatment are crucial. The aim of this study was to develop an effective educational program to enhance awareness of H5N1 and motivate people to access to health care earlier when H5N1 infection is suspected or likely. Methodology and Principal Findings: A study was conducted in two agricultural communities (intervention and control groups) in the Ninh Binh province in Vietnam, where epidemic outbreaks of avian influenza have recently occurred in birds. A unique educational intervention was developed and provided to the intervention group, and no intervention was provided to the control group. A knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey was conducted in both groups with a face-to-face interview by trained local healthcare workers at time points before and after the educational intervention. KAP scores were compared between the different time points and between the groups. How educational intervention influenced awareness relating to H5N1 and accessibility of healthcare in the population was analyzed. The study indicated an increased awareness of H5N1 and increased reliance on local health care workers. Conclusions: The novel educational program which was developed for this study impacted awareness of H5N1, and resulted in more people seeking early access to healthcare, and also resulted in earlier medical intervention for patients with H5N1 avian influenza infection in Vietnam. © 2011 Manabe et al. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Article; Attitude To Health; Attitude To Illness; Avian Influenza; Awareness; Behavior; Bird; Controlled Study; Education Program; Epidemic; Female; Health Care Access; Health Care Personnel; Health Survey; High Risk Population; Human; Influenza A (h5n1); Interview; Male; Motivation; Scoring System; Viet Nam; Animal; Health Education; Influenza; Influenza Virus A H5n1; Risk; Risk Reduction; Rural Population; Statistics; Aves; Animals; Awareness; Birds; Health Education; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5n1 Subtype; Influenza In Birds; Influenza, Human; Risk; Risk Reduction Behavior; Rural Population; Vietnam","adult; aged; agriculture; article; attitude to health; attitude to illness; avian influenza; awareness; behavior; bird; controlled study; education program; epidemic; female; health care access; health care personnel; health survey; high risk population; human; influenza A (H5N1); interview; male; motivation; scoring system; Viet Nam; animal; health education; influenza; Influenza virus A H5N1; risk; risk reduction; rural population; statistics; Aves; Animals; Awareness; Birds; Health Education; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Risk; Risk Reduction Behavior; Rural Population; Vietnam","","","","Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A H5n1; Beigel, John H., Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans, New England Journal of Medicine, 353, 13, pp. 1374-1385, (2005); Pham, Ngoc Dinh, Risk factors for human infection with avian influenza A H5N1, Vietnam, 2004, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 12, 12, pp. 1841-1847, (2006); OIE Daily Update on Avian Influenza Situation in Birds, (2010); Hien, Tran Tinh, Avian Influenza A (H5N1) in 10 Patients in Vietnam, New England Journal of Medicine, 350, 12, pp. 1179-1188, (2004); Chotpitayasunondh, Tawee, Human disease from influenza A (H5N1), Thailand, 2004, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 11, 2, pp. 201-209, (2005); Kandun, I.

We made a thorough investigation of the factors that can lead to false negativity of IGRA. Methods: We recruited 543 patients with new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in Hanoi, Viet Nam. At diagnosis, peripheral blood was collected and IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube) was performed. Clinical and epidemiological information of the host and pathogen was collected. The test sensitivity was calculated and factors negatively influencing IGRA results were evaluated using a logistic regression model in 504 patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Results: The overall sensitivity of IGRA was 92.3% (95% CI, 89.6%-94.4%). The proportions of IGRA-negative and -indeterminate results were 4.8% (95% CI, 3.1%-7.0%) and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.7%-4.9%). Age increased by year, body mass index <16.0, HIV co-infection and the increased number of HLA-DRB1*0701 allele that patients bear showed significant associations with IGRA negativity (OR = 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07], 5.42 [1.48-19.79], 6.38 [1.78-22.92] and 5.09 [2.31-11.22], respectively). HIV co-infection and the same HLA allele were also associated with indeterminate results (OR = 99.59 [95% CI, 15.58-625.61] and 4.25 [1.27-14.16]). Conclusions: Aging, emaciation, HIV co-infection and HLA genotype affected IGRA results. Assessment of these factors might contribute to a better understanding of the assay. © 2011 Hang et al. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gamma Interferon; Quantiferon-tb Gold In-tube; Gamma Interferon; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Article; Blood Sampling; Body Mass; Clinical Assessment; Computer Program; Controlled Study; Cytokine Release; Diagnostic Procedure; False Negative Result; Female; Genetic Association; Hla Typing; Host Pathogen Interaction; Human; Human Cell; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Lung Tuberculosis; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mixed Infection; Prospective Study; Protein Analysis; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity Analysis; Sensitivity Of Gamma Interferon Release Assay; Viet Nam","gamma interferon; adolescent; adult; age distribution; article; blood sampling; body mass; clinical assessment; computer program; controlled study; cytokine release; diagnostic procedure; false negative result; female; genetic association; HLA typing; host pathogen interaction; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; prospective study; protein analysis; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity of gamma interferon release assay; Viet Nam","","gamma interferon, 82115-62-6","","WHO Report 2009, (2009); Pai, Madhukar, Interferon-γ release assays: What is their role in the diagnosis of active tuberculosis?, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 44, 1, pp. 74-77, (2007); Dheda, Keertan U.J., T-cell interferon-γ release assays for the rapid immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis: Clinical utility in high-burden vs. low-burden settings, Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 188-200, (2009); Diel, Roland, Evidence-Based comparison of commercial Interferon-γ Release assays for detecting active TB a metaanalysis, Chest, 137, 4, pp. 952-968, (2010); Use of Interferon Gamma Release Assays in Support of Tb Diagnosis, (2011); Mazurek, Gerald N., Updated guidelines for using interferon gamma release assays to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection - United States, 2010, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 59, RR-5, pp. 1-25, (2010); Sester, Martina, Interferon-γ release assays for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis, European Respiratory Journal, 37, 1, pp. 100-111, (2011); Ling, Daphne I., Are interferon-γ release assays useful for diagnosing active tuberculosis in a high-burden setting?, European Respiratory Journal, 38, 3, pp. 649-656, (2011); Mustafa, Abu Salim, Multiple epitopes from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESAT-6 antigen are recognized by antigen-specific human T cell lines, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 30, pp. S201-S205, (2000); Brudey, Karine, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genetic diversity: Mining the fourth international spoligotyping database (SpolDB4) for classification, population genetics and epidemiology, BMC Microbiology, 6, (2006)","","","","","","","","19326203","","","21886824","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860412886"

Despite numerous attempts, these factors and mechanisms responsible for successful reprogramming remain elusive. Here, we identify one such factor, necessary for the development of nuclear transfer embryos, using porcine oocyte extracts in which some reprogramming events are recapitulated. After incubating somatic nuclei in oocyte extracts from the metaphase II stage, the oocyte proteins that were specifically and abundantly incorporated into the nuclei were identified by mass spectrometry. Among 25 identified proteins, we especially focused on a multi-functional protein, DJ-1. DJ-1 is present at a high concentration in oocytes from the germinal vesicle stage until embryos at the four-cell stage. Inhibition of DJ-1 function compromises the development of nuclear transfer embryos but not that of fertilized embryos. Microarray analysis of nuclear transfer embryos in which DJ-1 function is inhibited shows perturbed expression of P53 pathway components. In addition, embryonic arrest of nuclear transfer embryos injected with anti-DJ-1 antibody is rescued by P53 inhibition. We conclude that DJ-1 is an oocyte factor that is required for development of nuclear transfer embryos. This study presents a means for identifying natural reprogramming factors in mammalian oocytes and a unique insight into the mechanisms underlying reprogramming by nuclear transfer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Oocyte Extract And Proteomics; Reprogramming In Mammalian Oocytes; Protein; Intercellular Signaling Peptides And Proteins; Tumor Suppressor Protein P53; Dj 1 Protein; Oocyte Protein; Protein; Protein P53; Unclassified Drug; Animal Cell; Article; Cell Differentiation; Cell Nucleus Transplantation; Embryo; Mammal; Mass Spectrometry; Metaphase; Microarray Analysis; Nonhuman; Nuclear Reprogramming; Oocyte; Priority Journal; Protein Analysis; Protein Expression; Protein Function; Animals; Blastocyst; Cell Dedifferentiation; Female; Intercellular Signaling Peptides And Proteins; Metaphase; Nuclear Transfer Techniques; Oocytes; Swine; Tumor Suppressor Protein P53; Mammalia; Sus","DJ 1 protein; oocyte protein; protein; protein p53; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; cell differentiation; cell nucleus transplantation; embryo; mammal; mass spectrometry; metaphase; microarray analysis; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; oocyte; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; Animals; Blastocyst; Cell Dedifferentiation; Female; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Metaphase; Nuclear Transfer Techniques; Oocytes; Swine; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Mammalia; Sus","","protein, 67254-75-5; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, 0; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, 0","","Gurdon, John B., Sexually mature individuals of Xenopus laevis from the transplantation of single somatic nuclei, Nature, 182, 4627, pp. 64-65, (1958); Wilmut, Ian, Viable offspring derived from fetal and adult mammalian cells, Nature, 385, 6619, pp. 810-813, (1997); Takahashi, Kazutoshi, Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors, Cell, 126, 4, pp. 663-676, (2006); Stadtfeld, Matthias, Defining Molecular Cornerstones during Fibroblast to iPS Cell Reprogramming in Mouse, Cell Stem Cell, 2, 3, pp. 230-240, (2008); Brambrink, Tobias, Sequential Expression of Pluripotency Markers during Direct Reprogramming of Mouse Somatic Cells, Cell Stem Cell, 2, 2, pp. 151-159, (2008); Sridharan, Rupa, Role of the Murine Reprogramming Factors in the Induction of Pluripotency, Cell, 136, 2, pp. 364-377, (2009); Jaenisch, Rudolf, Stem Cells, the Molecular Circuitry of Pluripotency and Nuclear Reprogramming, Cell, 132, 4, pp. 567-582, (2008); Gurdon, John B., Nuclear Transfer and iPS May Work Best Together, Cell Stem Cell, 2, 2, pp. 135-138, (2008); Kim, Kitai, Epigenetic memory in induced pluripotent stem cells, Nature, 467, 7313, pp. 285-290, (2010); Kikyo, Nobuaki K., Active remodeling of somatic nuclei in egg cytoplasm by the nucleosomal ATPase ISWI, Science, 289, 5488, pp. 2360-2362, (2000)","","","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","21482765","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955567939"

Globally, mangrove areas are declining rapidly as they are cleared for coastal development and aquaculture and logged for timber and fuel production. Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16%) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40% of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss. Several species at high risk of extinction may disappear well before the next decade if existing protective measures are not enforced. © 2010 Polidoro et al. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Aquaculture; Article; Central America; Controlled Study; Endangered Species; Environmental Impact; Estuarine Species; Freshwater Environment; Geographic Distribution; Intertidal Species; Life History Trait; Mangrove; Nonhuman; Probability; Risk Assessment; Species Diversity; Species Extinction; Economics; Ecosystem; Growth, Development And Aging; Rhizophoraceae; Statistics; Tree; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Extinction, Biological; Probability; Trees","agriculture; aquaculture; article; Central America; controlled study; endangered species; environmental impact; estuarine species; freshwater environment; geographic distribution; intertidal species; life history trait; mangrove; nonhuman; probability; risk assessment; species diversity; species extinction; economics; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; Rhizophoraceae; statistics; tree; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Extinction, Biological; Probability; Trees","","","","Ellison, Aaron M., Managing mangroves with benthic biodiversity in mind: Moving beyond roving banditry, Journal of Sea Research, 59, 1-2, pp. 2-15, (2008); Duke, Norman C., A world without mangroves?

The climatic evidence comes from a seven-and-a-half century robust hydroclimate reconstruction from tropical southern Vietnamese tree rings. The Angkor droughts were of a duration and severity that would have impacted the sprawling city's water supply and agricultural productivity, while high-magnitude monsoon years damaged its water control infrastructure. Hydroclimate variability for this region is strongly and inversely correlated with tropical Pacific sea surface temperature, indicating that a warm Pacific and El Niño events induce drought at interannual and interdecadal time scales, and that low-frequency variations of tropical Pacific climate can exert significant influence over Southeast Asian climate and society. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Collapse; Dendrochronology; El Niño-southern Oscillation; Paleoclimate; Palmer Drought Severity Index; Agriculture; Article; Asia; Cambodia; Climate; Climate Change; Drought; El Nino; Paleoclimate; Priority Journal; Productivity; Sea Surface Temperature; Society; Water Supply; Agriculture; Climate; Droughts; Ecosystem; Geography; Geologic Sediments; Temperature; Time Factors; Trees; Tropical Climate; Vietnam; Water Supply","agriculture; article; Asia; Cambodia; climate; climate change; drought; El Nino; paleoclimate; priority journal; productivity; sea surface temperature; society; water supply; Agriculture; Climate; Droughts; Ecosystem; Geography; Geologic Sediments; Temperature; Time Factors; Trees; Tropical Climate; Vietnam; Water Supply","","","","Udaya, (2003); Befeo, (1979); deMenocal, Peter B., Cultural responses to climate change during the late holocene, Science, 292, 5517, pp. 667-673, (2001); Haug, Gerald H., Climate and the collapse of Maya civilization, Science, 299, 5613, pp. 1731-1735, (2003); Peterson, Larry C., Climate and the collapse of Maya civilization, American Scientist, 93, 4, pp. 322-329, (2005); National Geographic, (1929); Journal of Quaternary Science, (2009); Cullen, Heidi M., Climate change and the collapse of the Akkadian empire: Evidence from the deep sea, Geology, 28, 4, pp. 379-382, (2000); Angkor and the Khmer Civilization, (2003); Buckley, Brendan M., Decadal scale droughts over northwestern Thailand over the past 448 years: Links to the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean sectors, Climate Dynamics, 29, 1, pp. 63-71, (2007)","","","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","20351244","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951056159"

In mouse brain slices, we found that cPLA<inf>2</inf>α knockout blocked LTD induction, which was rescued by replenishing arachidonic acid (AA) or prostaglandin (PG) D<inf>2</inf> or E<inf>2</inf>. Moreover, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors block LTD, which is rescued by supplementing PGD <inf>2</inf>/E<inf>2</inf>. The blockade or rescue occurs when these reagents are applied within a time window of 5-15 min following the onset of LTD-inducing stimulation. Furthermore, PGD<inf>2</inf>/E<inf>2</inf> facilitates the chemical induction of LTD by a PKC activator but is unable to rescue the LTD blocked by a PKC inhibitor. We conclude that PGD<inf>2</inf>/E<inf>2</inf> mediates LTD jointly with PKC, and suggest possible pathways for their interaction. Finally, we demonstrate in awake mice that cPLA<inf>2</inf>α deficiency or COX-2 inhibition attenuates short-term adaptation of optokinetic eye movements, supporting the view that LTD underlies motor learning. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Arachidonic; Okr; Pla2; Prostaglandin; Purkinje; Arachidonic Acid; Phospholipase A2; Prostaglandin D2; Prostaglandin E2; Protein Kinase C; 4-(4-cyano-2-(2-(4-fluoronaphthalen-1-yl)propionylamino)phenyl)butyric Acid; Aniline Compounds; Cinnamates; Cyclooxygenase 2; Fluoresceins; Group Iv Phospholipases A2; Naphthalenes; Ono 8713; Oregon Green 488 Bapta-1; Phenylbutyrates; Arachidonic Acid; Cyclooxygenase 2; Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitor; Phospholipase A2; Phospholipase A2 Alpha; Prostaglandin D2; Prostaglandin E2; Protein Kinase C; Unclassified Drug; Animal Experiment; Article; Cerebellum Cortex; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Inhibition; Long Term Depression; Male; Motor Performance; Mouse; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Protein Interaction; Purkinje Cell; Aniline Compounds; Animals; Cerebellum; Cinnamates; Cyclooxygenase 2; Fluoresceins; Group Iv Phospholipases A2; Learning; Lipid Metabolism; Long-term Synaptic Depression; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57bl; Motor Activity; Naphthalenes; Phenylbutyrates; Signal Transduction; Mus","arachidonic acid; cyclooxygenase 2; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; phospholipase A2; phospholipase A2 alpha; prostaglandin D2; prostaglandin E2; protein kinase C; unclassified drug; animal experiment; article; cerebellum cortex; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; long term depression; male; motor performance; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein interaction; Purkinje cell; Aniline Compounds; Animals; Cerebellum; Cinnamates; Cyclooxygenase 2; Fluoresceins; Group IV Phospholipases A2; Learning; Lipid Metabolism; Long-Term Synaptic Depression; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Motor Activity; Naphthalenes; Phenylbutyrates; Signal Transduction; Mus","","arachidonic acid, 506-32-1, 6610-25-9, 7771-44-0; phospholipase A2, 9001-84-7; prostaglandin D2, 41598-07-6; prostaglandin E2, 363-24-6; protein kinase C, 141436-78-4; 4-(4-cyano-2-(2-(4-fluoronaphthalen-1-yl)propionylamino)phenyl)butyric acid, 0; Aniline Compounds, 0; Cinnamates, 0; Cyclooxygenase 2, 1.14.99.1; Fluoresceins, 0; Group IV Phospholipases A2, 3.1.1.4; Naphthalenes, 0; ONO 8713, 0; Oregon green 488 BAPTA-1, 0; Phenylbutyrates, 0","","Chen, Chu, Cyclooxygenase-2 regulates prostaglandin E2 signaling in hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity, Journal of Neurophysiology, 87, 6, pp. 2851-2857, (2002); Shimizu, Takao, Lipid mediators in health and disease: Enzymes and receptors as therapeutic targets for the regulation of immunity and inflammation, Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, 49, pp. 123-150, (2009); Akaneya, Yukio, Bidirectional trafficking of prostaglandin E2 receptors involved in long-term potentiation in visual cortex, Journal of Neuroscience, 26, 40, pp. 10209-10221, (2006); Murakami, Makoto, Phospholipase A2, Journal of Biochemistry, 131, 3, pp. 285-292, (2002); Shirai, Yoshinori, Specific differential expression of phospholipase A 2 subtypes in rat cerebellum, Journal of Neurocytology, 33, 3, pp. 297-307, (2004); Linden, David J., Phospholipase A2 controls the induction of short-term versus long-term depression in the cerebellar Purkinje neuron in culture, Neuron, 15, 6, pp. 1393-1401, (1995); Reynolds, T., Roles for nitric oxide and arachidonic acid in the induction of heterosynaptic cerebellar LTD, NeuroReport, 12, 1, pp. 133-136, (2001); Tanaka, Keiko, A Positive Feedback Signal Transduction Loop Determines Timing of Cerebellar Long-Term Depression, Neuron, 59, 4, pp. 608-620, (2008); Ito, Masao, Cerebellar long-term depression: Characterization, signal transduction, and functional roles, Physiological Reviews, 81, 3, pp. 1143-1195, (2001); O'Banion, Michael Kerry, Cyclooxygenase-2: Molecular biology, pharmacology, and neurobiology, Critical Reviews in Neurobiology, 13, 1, pp. 45-82, (1999)","","","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","20133605","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77649257847"

However, oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses have been isolated from oseltamivir-treated patients. Moreover, reassortment between H5N1 viruses and oseltamvir-resistant human H1N1 viruses currently circulating could create oseltamivirresistant H5N1 viruses, rendering the oseltamivir stockpile obsolete. Therefore, there is a need for unique and effective antivirals to combat H5N1 influenza viruses. The investigational drug T-705 (favipiravir; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) has antiviral activity against seasonal influenza viruses and a mouseadapted H5N1 influenza virus derived from a benign duck virus. However, its efficacy against highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, which are substantially more virulent, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that T-705 effectively protects mice from lethal infection with oseltamivir-sensitive or -resistant highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. Furthermore, our biochemical analysis suggests that T-705 ribofuranosyl triphosphate, an active form of T-705, acts like purines or purine nucleosides in human cells and does not inhibit human DNA synthesis. We conclude that T-705 shows promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza patients. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Antiviral Compounds; Murine Lethal-infection Model; Neuraminidase; Favipiravir; Oseltamivir; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide; Amides; Antiviral Agents; Dna-directed Dna Polymerase; Oseltamivir; Pyrazines; Ribavirin; T 705; Antivirus Agent; Favipiravir; Oseltamivir; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Antiviral Activity; Article; Controlled Study; Drug Dose Comparison; Drug Efficacy; Drug Mechanism; Female; Human; Human Cell; Influenza; Influenza Virus A H5n1; Mouse; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Virus Infection; Aged; Amides; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Cell Line; Child; Dna Replication; Dna-directed Dna Polymerase; Dogs; Drug Resistance, Viral; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5n1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Kidney; Kinetics; Lung; Oseltamivir; Pyrazines; Ribavirin; Influenza A Virus; Murinae; Mus; Orthomyxoviridae","antivirus agent; favipiravir; oseltamivir; animal experiment; animal model; antiviral activity; article; controlled study; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; female; human; human cell; influenza; Influenza virus A H5N1; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; virus infection; Aged; Amides; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Cell Line; Child; DNA Replication; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Dogs; Drug Resistance, Viral; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Kidney; Kinetics; Lung; Oseltamivir; Pyrazines; Ribavirin; Influenza A virus; Murinae; Mus; Orthomyxoviridae","","favipiravir, 259793-96-9; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, 0; Amides, 0; Antiviral Agents, 0; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, 2.7.7.7; Oseltamivir, 0; Pyrazines, 0; Ribavirin, 36791-04-5","","Simonsen, Lone, The global impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality, Vaccine, 17, SUPPL. 1, pp. S3-S10, (1999); Dolin, Raphael, A Controlled Trial of Amantadine and Rimantadine in the Prophylaxis of Influenza a Infection, New England Journal of Medicine, 307, 10, pp. 580-584, (1982); Hay, Alan J., The molecular basis of the specific anti-influenza action of amantadine., EMBO Journal, 4, 11, pp. 3021-3024, (1985); Bright, Rick A., Adamantane resistance among influenza A viruses isolated early during the 2005-2006 influenza season in the United States, JAMA, 295, 8, pp. 891-894, (2006); Shiraishi, Kyoko, High frequency of resistant viruses harboring different mutations in amantadine-treated children with influenza, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 188, 1, pp. 57-61, (2003); He, Guimei, Amantadine-resistance among H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated in Northern China, Antiviral Research, 77, 1, pp. 72-76, (2008); Zambon, Maria C., Position statement: Global neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility network, Antiviral Research, 49, 3, pp. 147-156, (2001); Varghese, Joseph N., Three‐dimensional structure of the complex of 4‐guanidino‐Neu5Ac2en and influenza virus neuraminidase, Protein Science, 4, 6, pp. 1081-1087, (1995); Kiso, Maki, Resistant influenza A viruses in children treated with oseltamivir: Descriptive study, The Lancet, 364, 9436, pp. 759-765, (2004); Hatakeyama, Shuji, Emergence of influenza B viruses with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors, JAMA, 297, 13, pp. 1435-1442, (2007)","","","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","20080770","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-76249125006"

Although effective infection control measures are expected to reduce nosocomial TB, HCWs' infection has not been assessed enough in TB high burden countries. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of TB infection and its risk factors among HCWs in Hanoi, Viet Nam. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 300 HCWs including all staff members in a municipal TB referral hospital received an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tub™, followed by one- and two-step tuberculin skin test (TST) and a questionnaire-based interview. Agreement between the tests was evaluated by kappa statistics. Risk factors for TB infection were analyzed using a logistic regression model. Among the participants aged from 20 to 58 years (median = 40), prevalence of TB infection estimated by IGRA, one- and two-step TST was 47.3%, 61.1% and 66.3% respectively. Although the levels of overall agreement between IGRA and TST were moderate, the degree of agreement was low in the group with BCG history (kappa = 0.29). Working in TB hospital was associated with twofold increase in odds of TB infection estimated by IGRA. Increased age, low educational level and the high body mass index also demonstrated high odds ratios of IGRA positivity. Conclusions/Significance: Prevalence of TB infection estimated by either IGRA or TST is high among HCWs in the hospital environment for TB care in Viet Nam and an infection control program should be reinforced. In communities with heterogeneous history of BCG vaccination, IGRA seems to estimate TB infection more accurately than any other criteria using TST. © 2009 Lien et al. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gamma Interferon; Tuberculin; Quantiferon Tb Gold In Tube; Gamma Interferon; Quantiferon Tb Gold In Tube; Tuberculin; Unclassified Drug; Adult; Article; Assay; Body Mass; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Diagnostic Accuracy; Education; Female; Health Care Personnel; Hospital; Human; Infection Risk; Major Clinical Study; Male; Prevalence; Questionnaire; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis; Viet Nam; Hospital Personnel; Middle Aged; Risk Factor; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personnel, Hospital; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis; Vietnam","gamma interferon; quantiferon tb gold in tube; tuberculin; unclassified drug; adult; article; assay; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; education; female; health care personnel; hospital; human; infection risk; major clinical study; male; prevalence; questionnaire; tuberculin test; tuberculosis; Viet Nam; hospital personnel; middle aged; risk factor; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personnel, Hospital; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis; Vietnam","","gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; tuberculin, 92129-86-7","","Joshi, Rajnish P., Tuberculosis among health-care workers in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review, PLOS Medicine, 3, 12, pp. 2376-2391, (2006); Seidler, Andreas, Review of epidemiological studies on the occupational risk of tuberculosis in low-incidence areas, Respiration, 72, 4, pp. 431-446, (2005); Jensen, Paul Arthur, Guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health-care settings, 2005., MMWR Recommendations and Reports, 54, 17, pp. 1-141, (2005); Albuquerque da Costa, Priscila, Administrative measures for preventing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Journal of Hospital Infection, 72, 1, pp. 57-64, (2009); Yanai, Hideki, Risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease among health care workers, Chiang Rai, Thailand, International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, 7, 1, pp. 36-45, (2003); Blumberg, Henry Michael, Preventing the nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 122, 9, pp. 658-663, (1995); Farhat, Maha Reda, False-positive tuberculin skin tests: What is the absolute effect of BCG and non-tuberculous mycobacteria?, International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, 10, 11, pp. 1192-1204, (2006); Richard (Dick), Menzies, Meta-analysis: New tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: Areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research, Annals of Internal Medicine, 146, 5, pp. 340-354, (2007); Pai, Madhukar, Systematic review: T-cell-based assays for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: An update, Annals of Internal Medicine, 149, 3, pp. 177-184, (2008); Nienhaus, Albert, Interferon-gamma release assay for the diagnosis of latent TB infection - Analysis of discordant results, when compared to the tuberculin skin test, PLOS ONE, 3, 7, (2008)","","","","","","","","19326203","","","19710920","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-69849089789"

Most previous research suggests that frequent-fire regimes in the late Holocene were associated with intensification of human activities, especially agriculture development. Here, we analyze fire regimes recorded in the Song Hong delta area of Vietnam over the past 5,000 years. In the prehistoric period, 2 long-term, low-charcoal abundance periods have been linked to periods of low humidity and cool climate, and 5 short-term fire regimes of 100-150 years in duration occurred at regular intervals of ≈700 years. However, over the last 1,500 years, the number, frequency, and intensity of fire regimes clearly increased. Six intensified-fire regime periods in northern Vietnam during this time coincided with changes of Vietnamese dynasties and associated warfare and unrest. In contrast, agricultural development supported by rulers of stable societies at this time does not show a positive correlation with intensified-fire regime periods. Thus, warfare rather than agriculture appears to have been a critical factor contributing to fire regimes in northern Vietnam during the late Holocene. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Charcoal; Fire Regime; Human Activities; Song Hong (red River); Charcoal; Agriculture; Article; Climate; Fire; Holocene; Humidity; Priority Journal; Soil Analysis; Viet Nam; War; Agriculture; Archaeology; Charcoal; Climate; Fires; History, Ancient; Humans; Vietnam; War","agriculture; article; climate; fire; Holocene; humidity; priority journal; soil analysis; Viet Nam; war; Agriculture; Archaeology; Charcoal; Climate; Fires; History, Ancient; Humans; Vietnam; War","","Charcoal, 16291-96-6","","Bond, William J., Fire and plants, (1996); Dwyer, Edward, Global spatial and temporal distribution of vegetation fire as determined from satellite observations, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 21, 6-7, pp. 1289-1302, (2000); Wright, Herbert Edgar, Introduction, Quaternary Research, 3, 3, pp. 319-328, (1973); Carcaillet, Christopher, Holocene biomass burning and global dynamics of the carbon cycle, Chemosphere, 49, 8, pp. 845-863, (2002); Clark, James S., Climate implications of biomass burning since the 19th century in eastern North America, Global Change Biology, 2, 5, pp. 433-442, (1996); Maxwell, Andrew Lee, Holocene monsoon changes inferred from lake sediment pollen and carbonate records, northeastern Cambodia, Quaternary Research, 56, 3, pp. 390-400, (2001); Swetnam, Tyson L., Mesoscale disturbance and ecological response to decadal climatic variability in the American Southwest, Journal of Climate, 11, 12, pp. 3128-3147, (1998); Carcaillet, Christopher, Holocene changes in seasonal precipitation highlighted by fire incidence in eastern Canada, Climate Dynamics, 16, 7, pp. 549-559, (2000); Clark, James S., Fire and climate change during the last 750 yr in northwestern Minnesota, Ecological Monographs, 60, 2, pp. 135-159, (1990); Long, Colin J., A 9000-year fire history from the Oregon Coast Range, based on a high-resolution charcoal study, Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 28, 5, pp. 774-787, (1998)","","","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","19597148","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-67650889136"

The precise origins and dispersal routes of the Austronesian peoples and the associated Lapita culture remain contentious, and numerous disparate models of dispersal (based primarily on linguistic, genetic, and archeological data) have been proposed. Here, through the use of mtDNA from 781 modern and ancient Sus specimens, we provide evidence for an early human-mediated translocation of the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) to Flores and Timor and two later separate human-mediated dispersals of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) through Island Southeast Asia into Oceania. Of the later dispersal routes, one is unequivocally associated with the Neolithic (Lapita) and later Polynesian migrations and links modern and archeological Javan, Sumatran, Wallacean, and Oceanic pigs with mainland Southeast Asian S. scrofa. Archeological and genetic evidence shows these pigs were certainly introduced to islands east of the Wallace Line, including New Guinea, and that so-called ""wild"" pigs within this region are most likely feral descendants of domestic pigs introduced by early agriculturalists. The other later pig dispersal links mainland East Asian pigs to western Micronesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines. These results provide important data with which to test current models for human dispersal in the region. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestication; Mtdna; Pacific Colonization; Phylogeography; Dna, Mitochondrial; Mitochondrial Dna; Animal Tissue; Article; Dna Determination; Domestic Pig; Geological Time; Migration; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Pacific Islands; Paleoanthropology; Paleoenvironment; Phylogeography; Population Movement Pattern; Priority Journal; Southeast Asia; Swine; Unindexed Sequence; Animal; Bayes Theorem; Genetics; Geography; Haplotype; History; Molecular Genetics; Phylogeny; Population Migration; Principal Component Analysis; Gabaza; Suidae; Sus; Sus Celebensis; Sus Scrofa; Sus Scrofa Domestica; Animal Migration; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Bayes Theorem; Dna, Mitochondrial; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceania; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Swine","mitochondrial DNA; animal tissue; article; DNA determination; domestic pig; geological time; migration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Pacific islands; paleoanthropology; paleoenvironment; phylogeography; population movement pattern; priority journal; Southeast Asia; swine; unindexed sequence; animal; Bayes theorem; genetics; geography; haplotype; history; molecular genetics; phylogeny; population migration; principal component analysis; Gabaza; Suidae; Sus; Sus celebensis; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica; Animal Migration; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Bayes Theorem; DNA, Mitochondrial; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceania; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Swine","GENBANK: DQ779287, DQ779288, DQ779289, DQ779290, DQ779291, DQ779292, DQ779293, DQ779294, DQ779295, DQ779296, DQ779297, DQ779298, DQ779299, DQ779300, DQ779301, DQ779302, DQ779303, DQ779304, DQ779305, DQ779306, DQ779307, DQ779308, DQ779309, DQ779310, DQ779311, DQ779312, DQ779313, DQ779314, DQ779315, DQ779316, DQ779317, DQ779318, DQ779319, DQ779320, DQ779321, DQ779322, DQ779323, DQ779324, DQ779325, DQ779326, DQ779327, DQ779328, DQ779329, DQ779330, DQ779331, DQ779332, DQ779333, DQ779334, DQ779335, DQ779336, DQ779337, DQ779338, DQ779339, DQ779340, DQ779341, DQ779342, DQ779343, DQ779344, DQ779345, DQ779346, DQ779347, DQ779348, DQ779349, DQ779350, DQ779351, DQ779352, DQ779353, DQ779354, DQ779355, DQ779356, DQ779357, DQ779358, DQ779359, DQ779360, DQ779361, DQ779362, DQ779363, DQ779364, DQ779365, DQ779366, DQ779367, DQ779368, DQ779369, DQ779370, DQ779371, DQ779372, DQ779373, DQ779374, DQ779375, DQ779376, DQ779377, DQ779378, DQ779379, DQ779380, DQ779381, DQ779382, DQ779383, DQ779384, DQ779385, DQ779386, DQ779387, DQ779388, DQ779389, DQ779390, DQ779391, DQ779392, DQ779393, DQ779394, DQ779395, DQ779396, DQ779397, DQ779398, DQ779399, DQ779400, DQ779401, DQ779402, DQ779403, DQ779404, DQ779405, DQ779406, DQ779407, DQ779408, DQ779409, DQ779410, DQ779411, DQ779412, DQ779413, DQ779414, DQ779415, DQ779416, DQ779417, DQ779418, DQ779419, DQ779420, DQ779421, DQ779422, DQ779423, DQ779424, DQ779425, DQ779426, DQ779427, DQ779428, DQ779429, DQ779430, DQ779431, DQ779432, DQ779433, DQ779434, DQ779435, DQ779436, DQ779437, DQ779438, DQ779439, DQ779440, DQ779441, DQ779442, DQ779443, DQ779444, DQ779445, DQ779446, DQ779447, DQ779448, DQ779449, DQ779450, DQ779451, DQ779452, DQ779453, DQ779454, DQ779455, DQ779456, DQ779457, DQ779458, DQ779459, DQ779460, DQ779461, DQ779462, DQ779463, DQ779464, DQ779465, DQ779466, DQ779467, DQ779468, DQ779469, DQ779470, DQ779471, DQ779472, DQ779473, DQ779474, DQ779475, DQ779476, DQ779477, DQ779478, DQ779479, DQ779480, DQ779481, DQ779482, DQ779483, DQ779484, DQ779485, DQ779486, DQ779487, DQ779488, DQ779489, DQ779490, DQ779491, DQ779492, DQ779493, DQ779494, DQ779495, DQ779496, DQ779497, DQ779498, DQ779499, DQ779500, DQ779501, DQ779502, DQ779503, DQ779504, DQ779505, DQ779506, DQ779507, DQ779508, DQ779509, DQ779510, DQ779511, DQ779512, DQ779513, DQ779514, DQ779515, DQ779516, DQ779517, DQ779518, DQ779519, DQ779520, DQ779521, DQ779522, DQ779523, DQ779524, DQ779525, DQ779526, DQ779527, DQ779528, DQ779529, DQ779530, DQ779531, DQ779532, DQ779533, DQ779534, DQ779535, DQ779536","DNA, Mitochondrial, 0","","Diamond, Jared M., Taiwan's gift to the world, Nature, 403, 6771, pp. 709-710, (2000); Archaeology and Language II Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses, (1998); On the Road of the Winds an Archaeological History of the Pacific Islands Before European Contact, (2000); Bellwood, Peter S., On explicit 'replacement' models in Island Southeast Asia: A reply to Stephen Oppenheimer, World Archaeology, 37, 4, pp. 503-506, (2005); Terrell, John Edward, Foregone Conclusions?: In search of “Papuans” and “Austronesians”, Current Anthropology, 42, 1, pp. 97-107, (2001); Oppenheimer, S.

Human and avian influenza A viruses differ in their recognition of host cell receptors: the former preferentially recognize receptors with saccharides terminating in sialic acid-α2,6- galactose (SAα2,6Gal), whereas the latter prefer those ending in SAα2,3Gal (refs 3-6). A conversion from SAα2,3Gal to SAα2,6Gal recognition is thought to be one of the changes that must occur before avian influenza viruses can replicate efficiently in humans and acquire the potential to cause a pandemic. By identifying mutations in the receptor-binding haemagglutinin (HA) molecule that would enable avian H5N1 viruses to recognize human-type host cell receptors, it may be possible to predict (and thus to increase preparedness for) the emergence of pandemic viruses. Here we show that some H5N1 viruses isolated from humans can bind to both human and avian receptors, in contrast to those isolated from chickens and ducks, which recognize the avian receptors exclusively. Mutations at positions 182 and 192 independently convert the HAs of H5N1 viruses known to recognize the avian receptor to ones that recognize the human receptor. Analysis of the crystal structure of the HA from an H5N1 virus used in our genetic experiments shows that the locations of these amino acids in the HA molecule are compatible with an effect on receptor binding. The amino acid changes that we identify might serve as molecular markers for assessing the pandemic potential of H5N1 field isolates. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomarkers; Carboxylic Acids; Cells; Epidemiology; Mutagenesis; Avian Influenza; Mutations; Pandemic Viruses; Receptors; Sialic Acid; Viruses; Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin; Molecular Marker; Mutant Protein; Receptor; Avian Influenza; Crystal Structure; Genetic Analysis; Influenza; Mutation; Protein; Virus; Amino Acid Substitution; Animal Cell; Article; Controlled Study; Epidemic; Influenza Virus A; Molecular Recognition; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Protein Structure; Receptor Binding; Structure Analysis; Virus Isolation; Virus Mutation; Anas; Aves; Avian Influenza Virus; Gallus Gallus; Influenza A Virus","Biomarkers; Carboxylic acids; Cells; Epidemiology; Mutagenesis; Avian influenza; Mutations; Pandemic viruses; Receptors; Sialic acid; Viruses; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; molecular marker; mutant protein; receptor; avian influenza; crystal structure; genetic analysis; influenza; mutation; protein; virus; amino acid substitution; animal cell; article; controlled study; epidemic; Influenza virus A; molecular recognition; nonhuman; priority journal; protein structure; receptor binding; structure analysis; virus isolation; virus mutation; Anas; Aves; Avian influenza virus; Gallus gallus; Influenza A virus","","","Acknowledgements We thank K.

Comparison of the 15 Vietnamese isolates among themselves and with reported full or partial HCV genomic sequences indicated that they were classifiable into four major groups (groups 6-9) divided into six genotypes (6a, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9a). Vietnamese HCV isolates of genotypes 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9a were significantly different from those classified into groups 4, 5, and 6 based on divergence within partial sequences; those of genotype 6a were homologous to a Hong Kong isolate (HK2) of genotype 6a. Phylogenetic trees based on the envelope 1 (E1) gene (576 bp) of 55 isolates and a part of the nonstructural 5 (NS5) region (1093 bp) of 43 isolates revealed at least nine major groups, three of which (groups 7, 8, and 9) were identified only in Vietnamese blood donors. With a prospect that many more HCV isolates with significant sequence divergence will be reported from all over the world, the domain of the HCV genome to be compared and criteria for grouping/typing and genotyping/subtyping will have to be determined, so that they may be correlated with virological, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic Heterogeneity; Non-a, Non-b Hepatitis; Taxonomy; Virus Evolution; Article; Blood Donor; Envelope Gene; Gene Sequence; Genotype; Hepatitis C Virus; Hepatitis Non A Non B; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Priority Journal; Virus Characterization; Virus Gene; Virus Isolation; Non-a, Non-b Hepatitis Virus","article; blood donor; envelope gene; gene sequence; genotype; Hepatitis C virus; hepatitis non A non B; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; virus characterization; virus gene; virus isolation; Non-A, non-B hepatitis virus","GENBANK: D14204, D14205, D14207, D14208, D14209, D14211, D17470, D17471, D17472, D17473, D17474, D17475, D17476, D17477, D17478, D17479, D17480, D17481, D17482, D17483, D17484, D17485, D17486, D17487, D17488, D17489, D17490, D17491, D17492, D17493","","","Houghton, Michael A., Molecular biology of the hepatitis C viruses: Implications for diagnosis, development and control of viral disease, Hepatology, 14, 2, pp. 381-388, (1991); Simmonds, Peter N., Sequence variability in the 5' non-coding region of hepatitis C virus: Identification of a new virus type and restrictions on sequence diversity, Journal of General Virology, 74, 4, pp. 661-668, (1993); Mori, Shigehisa, A new type of hepatitis C virus in patients in Thailand, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 183, 1, pp. 334-342, (1992); Sakamoto, Minoru, Entire nucleotide sequence and characterization of a hepatitis C virus of genotype V/3a, Journal of General Virology, 75, 7, pp. 1761-1768, (1994); Okamoto, Hiroaki, The entire nucleotide sequence and classification of a hepatitis C virus isolate of a novel genotype from an Indonesian patient with chronic liver disease, Journal of General Virology, 75, 3, pp. 629-635, (1994); Bukh, Jens, At least 12 genotypes of hepatitis C virus predicted by sequence analysis of the putative E1 gene of isolates collected worldwide, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 90, 17, pp. 8234-8238, (1993); Simmonds, Peter N., Classification of hepatitis C virus into six major genotypes and a series of subtypes by phylogenetic analysis of the NS-5 region, Journal of General Virology, 74, 11, pp. 2391-2399, (1993); Stuyver, Lieven J., Typing of hepatitis C virus isolates and characterization of new subtypes using a line probe assay, Journal of General Virology, 74, 6, pp. 1093-1102, (1993); Song, Pham, Markers of hepatitis C and B virus infections among blood donors in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, Vietnam, Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology, 1, 4, pp. 413-418, (1994); Okamoto, Hiroaki, Typing hepatitis C virus by polymerase chain reaction with type-specific primers: Application to clinical surveys and tracing infectious sources, Journal of General Virology, 73, 3, pp. 673-679, (1992)","","National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","7972001","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028110354"
