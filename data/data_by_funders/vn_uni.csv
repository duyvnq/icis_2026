This study analyzed the 210Po activity in thirty specimens of Dotted gizzard shad, a common and commercially important species of Clupeiform fish distributed in Quang Ninh province, Vietnam. The measurements were taken using an alpha spectrometer to measure the radionuclide from various tissues collected from each fish specimen. The highest activities of 210Po were found in the liver and intestine, while the lowest activity was observed in muscle tissue. The trend of 210Po activity in the different tissues was muscle < skin < stomach < gill < bone < intestine < liver, with mean values of 15.1 ± 1.7, 39.6 ± 9.6, 51.2 ± 5.5, 58.2 ± 7.2, 62.2 ± 13.5, 241 ± 18.7, and 346 ± 30.5 Bq.kg−1, respectively. There was an insignificant correlation between 210Po activity in the muscle and the mass and size of the fish. The calculated annual effective dose for adults from consuming only the Dotted gizzard shad containing 210Po exceeded the recommendation value (1 mSv.y−1) for all tissues except muscle. The concern for exceeding ingestion doses applies primarily to consumers who choose to eat the organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, of Dotted gizzard shad, assuming an annual consumption of 27 kg.y−1 for each organ. Therefore, this study emphasizes that people should be advised not to consume the digestive organs of Dotted gizzard shad to avoid radiological risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","210Po; Clupeiform fish; Committed effective dose; Quang Ninh province; Radionuclide","","","","The authors sincerely thank the Editorial Board of the Regional Studies in Marine Science journal and the reviewers for their valuable contributions in improving the quality of our manuscript.

To characterize the variation of PM2.5-bound PAHs in the urban area of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the biggest city in southern Vietnam, we conducted a whole year sampling campaign. The sampling strategy for PM2.5-bound PAHs was deployed from March 2017 to March 2018 at six locations in HCMC. The sampling sites represented traffic emissions, residential areas, an urban background location, and a rural background location. The results showed that five-and six-ring PAHs predominated in PM2.5, accounting for approximately 70% of the total PAHs concentrations. Benzo(g,h,i)perylene (BghiP) and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene (InP) were the dominant species, contributing about 53% to the total PAHs. The seasonal variation of PAHs exhibited two peaks in May and December and dramatically dropped in March. We found significant negative correlations between PAHs and meteorological factors such as solar radiation, wind speed, and planetary boundary layer. This suggests an important role of meteorological factors in scavenging PAHs in urban HCMC. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) results reflected that vehicular emissions are the major local source of PM2.5-bound PAHs in urban HCMC. Additionally, the concentration weight trajectory approach (CWT) revealed that regional sources from the northeast area of HCMC contributed a large amount of medium molecular weight, high molecular weight, and total BaP equivalent (BaPTEQ). Furthermore, PM2.5-bound BaPTEQ significantly accumulated in the alveolar tissues of the human respiratory system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concentration weight trajectory (CWT); Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); Positive matrix factorization (PMF); Urban Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)","Aromatization; Bioremediation; Matrix algebra; Matrix factorization; Pyrene; Concentration weight trajectory; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Polycyclic aromatics; Positive matrix factorization; Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Urban ho chi minh city; Viet Nam; Health risks; deposition; health risk; PAH; particulate matter; respiratory disease; seasonal variation; urban area; wind velocity; Ho Chi Minh City","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number \u0110A2024-20-01.

It has a wide range of applications, including gate optimization, quantum-assisted compiling, quantum state preparation, and quantum dynamic simulation. Traditional quantum compilation usually optimizes circuits for a single target. However, many quantum systems require simultaneous optimization of multiple targets, such as thermal state preparation, time-dependent dynamic simulation, and others. To address this, we develop a multi-target quantum compilation algorithm to improve the performance and flexibility of simulating multiple quantum systems. Our benchmarks and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, highlighting the importance of multi-target optimization in advancing quantum computing.

Despite their pivotal role in diverse applications, they face challenges in dynamic settings due to limitation in existing Global Path Planning (GPP) and Local Path Planning (LPP) techniques. In response to this, we propose an innovative hybrid path planning approach that enhances the A* algorithm with a risk-aware heuristic function and integrates the Jump Point Search (JPS) technique for route optimization. Additionally, B-spline smoothing is employed for perceptually global trajectory refinement. Our approach also includes an innovative improvement to the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) to align with the proposed enhanced A* algorithm for effective local navigation. Acknowledging the importance of high-quality input in path planning, we present substantial improvements to the IRDC-Net, a monocular-image semantic-segmentation model that we studied previously. Novel improvements include the integration of quantization and the Adam optimizer, along with the implementation of the Balanced Cross-Entropy loss function. These enhancements not only elevate the output quality of IRDC-Net but also reduce the model’s training parameters.

While acoustic methods have become widespread in bat research, basic information is often lacking on the echolocation calls produced by Asian bat species. Since such information can aid a wide variety of research and conservation initiatives, descriptions of the calls emitted by Asian bats are fundamental. The aim of our study was to provide a standardized analysis and description of the Vietnamese bat echolocation calls. We analyzed call recordings of 87 species arranged in eight families. This constitutes 74% of the echolocating bats presently known in Vietnam and includes the first call descriptions for five taxa.

However, the poor quality of input data, which is very common in practical circumstances owing to the low-cost measurement and data acquisition devices, poses an enormous challenge for the predictive model to deeply extract the spatial and temporal correlation of the input data. This study proposes a Multi Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN) for short-term PV power forecast embedded with Laplacian Attention mechanism. By viewing the input sequences in a 2D form, the input map is constructed, and the interconnected feature among variables can be captured by convolution operation. Moreover, with the multiple CNN layers working in parallel architecture, different representations hidden inside the input map can be detected, enabling the proposed model to bring out promising performance across forecast time-step without modifying its initial parameters. In order to reduce the decay impact of irrelevant variables existing inside the input data, the Laplacian Attention mechanism is employed. The Attention matrix is dynamically modified during the training process to produce an accurate attention matrix, which represents the correlation between variables. Therefore, the model is able to focus on informative features and ignore negative ones. The experiments conducted on two different datasets with opposite characteristics provide deep insights into the strength of the proposed model over the baseline model, which strongly demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed model, especially when dealing with datasets bearing tough characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2D-CNN; Laplacian Attention mechanism; Multi-convolution; Multi-horizon; PV power forecast","Data acquisition; Forecasting; Input output programs; Laplace transforms; Matrix algebra; Parallel architectures; Power quality; 2d-CNN; Attention mechanisms; Input datas; Laplacian attention mechanism; Laplacians; Multi-convolution; Multi-horizon; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaic power forecast; Power forecast; Convolution","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam under project number T2022-PC-001.","Agga, Ali, CNN-LSTM: An efficient hybrid deep learning architecture for predicting short-term photovoltaic power production, Electric Power Systems Research, 208, (2022); Ahmed, Razin, A review and evaluation of the state-of-the-art in PV solar power forecasting: Techniques and optimization, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 124, (2020); Bondugula, Rohit Kumar, Intelligent analysis of multimedia healthcare data using natural language processing and deep-learning techniques, pp. 335-358, (2022); Das, Utpal Kumar, SVR-based model to forecast PV power generation under differentweather conditions, Energies, 10, 7, (2017); Ding, Dong, Non-intrusive load monitoring method with inception structured CNN, Applied Intelligence, 52, 6, pp. 6227-6244, (2022); Fantidis, J.

This study aimed to assess the quality of life (QoL) of people living in disadvantaged coastal communes (subdivision of Vietnam) and identify their associated factors by using the World Health Organization’s quality of life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF). To achieve this, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 595 individuals aged 18 years and above living in the coastal communes in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam, from October 2022 to February 2023. The results showed that the mean overall QoL (mean ± SD) was 61.1 ± 10.8. Among the four domains of QoL, the physical health (57.2 ± 12.3) domain had a lower score than the psychological health (61.9 ± 13.0), social relations (63.4 ± 13.4), and environment (61.9 ± 13.3) domains. The QoL score of the domains for participants affected by flooding was significantly lower than that of those not affected, except for social relations. Multivariable logistic regression showed that subjects with not good QoL had the educational background with no formal education (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.63, 95% CI 1.19–5.83), fairly poor/poor households (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.48–5.12), suffered Musculoskeletal diseases (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02–2.56), unsatisfaction with health status (OR = 5.27, 95% CI 2.44–11.37), family conflicts (OR = 4.51, 95%CI 2.10–9.69), and low levels of social support (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.14–6.02). The analysis also revealed that workers (OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04–0.66) had a better QoL than farmer-fisherman. QoL in disadvantaged coastal communes was low, with the lowest scores in the physical health domain. Based on the socioeconomic factors associated with not good QoL identified here, it is recommended that local authorities take more appropriate and practical measures to increase support, including measures for all aspects of physical health, psychological health, social relations, and the living environment, especially for people affected by floods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coastal area; Flood; Quality of life; WHOQOL-BREF","cross-sectional study; epidemiology; health status; human; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; Viet Nam; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Humans; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","","The authors would like to thank the students (Dr. Truong Huynh Anh Khoa and others) and the local volunteers who helped collect the data.

This article introduces the development of optimal and robust-optimal controllers grounded in the principles of stability control and fuzzy descriptor systems. By transforming complicated inequalities into linear matrix inequalities (LMI), we establish the essential conditions for controller construction, as delineated in theorems. To substantiate the utility of these controllers, we employ the rotary inverted pendulum as a testbed.

This study gives a comprehensive analysis of large-scale electrolyzer plants when providing frequency support to power systems. First, the authors present a model predictive control (MPC)-based secondary frequency controller, combined with a droop controller as the primary frequency controller and a virtual inertia controller. Additionally, the study introduces a universal system frequency response (U-SFR) modeling approach that enables high accuracy, low computation burden, and reduced initial parameters as a testbed. Finally, an in-depth analysis is conducted, focusing on different technical aspects of large-scale electrolyzer plants when providing frequency support services. Case studies integrating PEM and Alkaline electrolyzers into the modified IEEE 39-bus system with over 50% wind power penetration are conducted. It is found that the proposed U-SFR model achieves high accuracy with lower computational time compared to detailed physical models. Additionally, model predictive controllers improve frequency quality more effectively than PID and PID-FLC methods. PEM electrolyzers are found to be more efficient in providing grid frequency support than alkaline electrolyzers due to their technical characteristics. Finally, smaller hydrogen tanks may frequently breach storage constraints, negatively impacting the system's frequency response capability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline electrolyzer; Frequency regulation ancillary services; Hydrogen; PEM electrolyzer; Wind power","Bode diagrams; Electrolytic tanks; Frequency stability; Invariance; Proportional control systems; Wind power integration; Alkaline electrolyze; Alkalines; Ancillary service; Electrolyzers; Frequency regulation ancillary service; Frequency regulations; Large-scales; PEM-electrolyzer; Power; System frequency; Predictive control systems","","","This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2023-PC-031.

Our study estimated phytoplankton density and composition relating to aquaculture-impacted environmental factors. We analyzed water quality and phytoplankton at 35 sites in a tropical brackish lagoon, including inside aquaculture ponds (integrated farming of fish, shrimp, and crab), at wastewater discharge points, within 300 m of these points, and farther out in the lagoon. Measurements were taken after aquaculture activities started in March and again in July. In both periods, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and turbidity decreased from the aquaculture ponds to the farther lagoon areas. Principal component analysis showed that nutrients, turbidity, and Chl-a were critical factors in aquaculture ponds, while salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and water depth influenced water quality outside the ponds. Phytoplankton density was higher in July than in March due to aquaculture characteristics. Redundancy analysis indicated that phytoplankton, typical of inorganic, turbid, shallow lakes, was present throughout, whereas marine phytoplankton characterized the open water area (OWA). Marine phytoplankton caused a higher Shannon–Wiener index in July compared to March for OWA. Phytoplankton in aquaculture ponds was dominated by Oscillatoria spp., while Thalassiosira spp. dominated outside the ponds. We also identified indicator genera for two connected lagoons. Although constant water exchange prevented identifying specific indicator phytoplankton groups for aquaculture, this revealed the impact of wastewater from aquaculture ponds on the natural environment in the lagoons. Research on phytoplankton communities is necessary for the sustainable development of aquaculture and environmental management in coastal lagoons. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aquaculture; Functional groups; Nutrients; Phytoplankton; Tropical lagoon; Viet Nam","Fish ponds; Network performance; Phytoplankton; Ponds; Shellfish; Aquaculture ponds; Chlorophyll a; Functionals; Marine phytoplankton; Open water; Phytoplankton composition; Phytoplankton densities; Tropical lagoon; Viet Nam; Water areas; Lakes; chlorophyll a; dissolved oxygen; nitrogen; phosphorus; chlorophyll; community composition; functional group; nutrient dynamics; phytoplankton; resource development; water quality; aquaculture; aquatic environment; Article; environmental factor; environmental parameters; habitat; indicator organism; lagoon; nonhuman; nutritional status; Oscillatoria; pH; population density; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; salinity; seasonal variation; species composition; species distribution; species dominance; temperature; Thalassiosira; tropics; turbidity; wastewater; water temperature; environmental monitoring; water pollutant; Aquaculture; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Salinity; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality","","chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was realized in the framework of the Institutional University Cooperation with Hue University (Vietnam)- the VLIR-UOS-IUC project: \u201CPreservation of coastal ecosystems and natural resources in development activities\u201D with the financial support of VLIR-UOS.

Monotonic tensile and cyclic loading tests were performed on CFRP-strengthened specimens with variations in the CFRP-bonding range on the flanges. This study focused on the strengthening methods A and B, which were proposed to address insufficient CFRP anchoring near gusset plates by bonding CFRP sheets to both sides of the flanges of the diagonal tension members. The results of the monotonic tensile loading tests indicated a significant increase in tensile stiffness and substantial improvements in yield strength (27%) and ultimate load-bearing capacity (51%) when the strengthening methods A and B were employed. Delamination of the bonded CFRP sheets was effectively delayed, occurring only after the steel yielded, owing to the use of a ductile adhesive (polyurea putty). On the other hand, the cyclic loading tests demonstrated a significant enhancement in the load-bearing capacities (33% for tensile, 32% for compressive) of the strengthened specimens. Moreover, the energy dissipation capacities of the specimens strengthened by methods A and B exhibited linear increases, with 12% and 14% higher values respectively than those of the non-strengthened specimen. Although the stiffnesses (tensile and compressive) of the strengthened specimens decreased in each loading loop, the strengthening methods A and B maintained the stiffness values at approximately 35% higher than those of the non-strengthened specimen. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbon fibre-reinforced polymer sheets; cyclic loading; diagonal tension members; load-bearing capacity; monotonic tensile loading; stiffness","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Cyclic loads; Gluing; Steel bridges; Tensile stress; Tensile testing; Carbon fiber reinforced polymers sheets; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Cyclic loading; Diagonal tension; Diagonal tension member; Load-bearing capacity; Monotonic tensile loading; Monotonics; Tensile loading; Tension members; Trusses","","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Nonetheless, the most significant drawback of Photovoltaic is its intermittence, making it an obvious source of power fluctuation. This study proposes a novel scheme for real-time or intraday PV power forecasting by adopting two predictive models, namely, White-box and Combination. The White-box model is implemented employing mathematical calculations and statistics called Exceedance Probability. Meanwhile, the Combination model is an aggregation of several predictive models' outputs including the White-box model and benchmark ones by dynamically adjusting the weight coefficient of each model based on their forecasting accuracy. The experimental results, which are verified on two PV systems corresponding to two case studies located at Vietnam and Australia, indicate that the two proposed models outperform other referenced models as (Formula presented.) improves approximately 40% and 38% in terms of the first and second case study, respectively.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed specific surface modifications of ACs. Electrochemical performance assessments, including charge-discharge behavior, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), demonstrated the superiority of KOH-AC in EDLC applications due to its high specific area and microporosity. The discharge capacitance of EDLC made from KOH-AC reached 24 F g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1, while those from K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> and Na<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>-AC did not surpass 14 F g-1 under the same conditions.

The diversification of this group is attributed not only to allopatric speciation but also to diversification in life-history traits and morphological traits that are involved in ecological adaptation and reproductive isolation. Precise phylogenetic reconstruction of Carabus is important to understanding the factors associated with species' divergence in relation to such character divergence. Here, we analyse the phylogeny of Carabus among higher taxonomic groups and among species of the subgenus Apotomopterus, a hyper-diverse group endemic to East Asia. We used genome-wide sequence data from ultraconserved elements for phylogenetic reconstruction via maximum-likelihood and species-tree reconstruction methods. With regard to the relationships among higher taxonomic groups, the obtained phylogenetic trees resolved two structures with previously unresolved divergence. The subgenus Apotomopterus contained three lineages, i.e. the Vitalisi, Prodigus, and Sauteri groups. It showed diversification of the spinula, a sclerotized male genital structure, and variation in the female elytral notch (preapical emargination). These morphological traits may be involved in copulatory behaviour and potentially affect reproductive isolation, and their character state divergence may have facilitated species divergence of Apotomopterus. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","genital morphology; ground beetles; phylogenomics; species radiation; ultraconserved elements","","","","valuable suggestions; Ye Liu, Liang-Kong Lin, Naoya Osawa, Kunio Araya, and Thierry Deuve for helping with sampling for molecular study.

Firstly, the atomic structures of Mo<inf>2</inf>C-MXenes are optimized, and their respective structures are created with comparative research. Secondly, their electronic band structures and optical properties are studied in detail. The estimation of the bandgap energy of Mo<inf>2</inf>C-MXenes with its functionalization reveal that most Mo<inf>2</inf>CF<inf>2</inf> and Mo<inf>2</inf>C(OH)<inf>2</inf> layers are semiconductors, while Mo<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>2</inf> behaves as a metal. The electrical and optical properties can be altered by controlling the on-surface functional groups and the number of layers. Computation of the thermoelectric (TE) properties of Mo<inf>2</inf>C-MXenes reveals that, upon heating to 600 K, Mo<inf>2</inf>CF<inf>2</inf> and Mo<inf>2</inf>C(OH)<inf>2</inf> exhibit a high Seebeck coefficient and a relatively high electrical conductivity. The Seebeck coefficient reaches ~400 µV K−1 at room temperature for all layers of Mo<inf>2</inf>CF<inf>2</inf> MXenes.

We describe the 12CO (J = 2-1), 13CO (J = 2-1), C18O (J = 2-1), H<inf>2</inf>CO (J = 3<inf>2,1</inf>-2<inf>2,0</inf>), and SiO (J = 5-4) molecular lines along with the 1.3 mm continuum at high spatial resolution (∼0.″08 or ∼5 au). Dust continuum emission is detected toward BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2, with a central compact component and extended continuum emission. The compact components are smooth and show no sign of substructures such as spirals, rings, or gaps. However, there is a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis of the presumed disk in IRS1, possibly indicative of an inclined geometrically and optically thick disk-like component. Using a position-velocity diagram analysis of the C18O line, clear Keplerian motions were not detected toward either source. If Keplerian rotationally supported disks are present, they are likely deeply embedded in their envelope. However, we can set upper limits of the central protostellar mass of 0.46 M <inf>⊙</inf> and 0.26 M <inf>⊙</inf> for BHR 71 IRS1 and BHR 71 IRS2, respectively. Outflows traced by 12CO and SiO are detected in both sources. The outflows can be divided into two components, a wide-angle outflow and a jet. In IRS1, the jet exhibits a double helical structure, reflecting the removal of angular momentum from the system. In IRS2, the jet is very collimated and shows a chain of knots, suggesting episodic accretion events. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study makes use of the following ALMA data: ADS/JAO.ALMA#2019.1.00261.L and ADS/JAO.ALMA#2021.1.00262.S.

Bacterial Cellulose (BC) has emerged as a promising biomaterial for sustainable applications in textiles and leather. However, dehydrated BC’s low thickness and high stiffness pose limitations, reducing its appeal in diverse fields, including fashion, healthcare, etc. To address this challenge, a Plasticized BC-based interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) leatherette is investigated using an innovative 2-in-1 thickening process and a following softening step using Glycerol. The thickening process involves a novel “self-thickening” technique based on cellulosic mercerization and a formation of interpenetrating polymer network structure using BC and Silica skeleton. The fabricated BC-based material exhibits unique IPN structure and significant increase in BC thickness to 1.83±0.10 mm (≈16.64 times thicker), areal density to 2034.46±37.58 g/m2 (≈16.33 times denser), moisture content of 31.09±0.48%, moisture regain of 45.12±1.01%, flexural rigidity of 3291.29±100.88 μNm, and improved bending modulus of 6.48±0.20 MPa (≈1035.27 times lower) compared to those of untreated BC. Furthermore, the durability of the Plasticized BC-based IPN leatherette is evaluated through five washing cycles, with the material retaining approximately 75.96%, 66.61%, 82.98%, and 77.39% of its unwashed thickness, areal density, moisture content, and regain, respectively. This study contributes to the value of BC-based materials in the textile and leather industries, offering a sustainable alternative to existing materials and production processes. Moreover, developing this novel 2-in-1 thickening process establishes a foundation for future research on BC functionalization in various applications, thereby contributing to sustainable development.

In MPQUIC, one of the most critical issues is efficiently scheduling the upcoming transmission packets on several paths considering path dynamicity. To this end, this paper introduces FQ-SAT - a novel Fuzzy Q-learning-based MPQUIC scheduler for data transmission optimization, including download time, in heterogeneous wireless networks. Different from previous works, FQ-SAT combines Q-learning and Fuzzy logic in an MPQUIC scheduler to determine optimal transmission on heterogeneous paths. FQ-SAT leverages the self-learning ability of reinforcement learning (i.e., in a Q-learning model) to deal with heterogeneity. Moreover, FQ-SAT facilitates Fuzzy logic to dynamically adjust the proposed Q-learning model's hyper-parameters along with the networks’ rapid changes. We evaluate FQ-SAT extensively in various scenarios in both simulated and actual networks. The results show that FQ-SAT reduces the single-file download time by 3.2%–13.5% in simulation and by 4.1%–13.8% in actual network, reduces the download time of all resources up to 20.4% in web browsing evaluation, and reaches percentage of on-time segments up to 97.5% in video streaming, compared to state-of-the-art MPQUIC schedulers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fuzzy logic; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile networks; MPQUIC; Q-learning; Scheduler","Federated learning; Reinforcement learning; Data-transmission; Download time; Fuzzy-Logic; Fuzzy-Q-learning; Learning models; MPQUIC; Multipath transport protocols; Optimisations; Q-learning; Scheduler; 5G mobile communication systems","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) under Grant 23H03377 .; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) under Grant 23H03377.

However, studies on Vietnamese golden camellias need to be expanded to fill a knowledge gap on these species' chemical profiles and pharmacological properties. This qualitative study focuses on six golden camellias: four endemic species from Tam Dao district, Vinh Phuc province, including Camellia hakodae, Camellia phanii, Camellia tamdaoensis, Camellia tienii and two species commonly cultivated in Quang Ninh province including Camellia petelotii and Camellia euphlebia. A mutual profile of 131 metabolites was obtained by using widely targeted metabolomics analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Comparative metabolomics was performed among leaf extracts of six golden teas, between young and mature leaves and between freeze-drying and oven-drying leaves to discriminate these species, and determine the effect of developmental stage and post-harvesting method on the plant metabolism. The PLS-DA model successfully illustrated a clear separation of the six species and suggested apigenin C-glycoside derivatives as chemical markers for the diversity.

Most of the time, air quality data are time series data. However, due to various reasons, we often encounter missing values in datasets collected during data preparation and aggregation steps. The inability to analyze and handle missing data will significantly hinder the data analysis process. To address this issue, this paper offers an extensive review of air quality prediction and missing data imputation techniques for time series, particularly in relation to environmental challenges. In addition, we empirically assess eight imputation methods, including mean, median, kNNI, MICE, SAITS, BRITS, MRNN, and Transformer, to scrutinize their impact on air quality data. The evaluation is conducted using diverse air quality datasets gathered from numerous cities globally. Based on these evaluations, we offer practical recommendations for practitioners dealing with missing data in time series scenarios for environmental data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; convolutional neural network; data analysis; data imputation; deep learning; feature extraction; health hazard; information processing; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical phenomena; multilayer perceptron; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; principal component analysis; random forest; recurrent neural network; social network; statistical analysis; support vector machine; wind speed; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans","","carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; ozone, 10028-15-6; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5; Air Pollutants","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DS2023-18-01.

The morphology and structure of the photocatalyst were determined by XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, EDX, BET, TGA, UV-vis DRS, PL, and XPS. The results showed that CNBC-30 had the best photocatalytic performance with an OTC removal efficiency of more than 87% within 120 min under the conditions of [OTC] = 20 mg L−1, [catalyst] = 500 mg L−1, [Na<inf>2</inf>S<inf>2</inf>O<inf>8</inf>] = 1.26 mM, and pH = 4 at room temperature, which was much better than those of pure g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>, Bi<inf>2</inf>MoO<inf>6</inf>, and CNB composites. This superiority is due to the excellent adsorption ability of clinoptilolite that effectively forms the g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>/Bi<inf>2</inf>MoO<inf>6</inf> heterojunctions, thus improving the ability to separate charge carriers while decreasing the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, the effect of catalyst dosage, oxidant concentration, initial pollutant concentration, solution pH, and coexisting anions on the OTC degradation was comprehensively studied. The results showed that the CNBC-30/PDS system had high reusability and adaptability at different pH levels (3.0-11.0). Quenching tests showed that 1O<inf>2</inf>, O<inf>2</inf>˙−, and h+ played the main roles in OTC degradation. In addition, OTC intermediates were identified and degradation pathways were proposed based on the results of MS analysis. DFT calculations successfully predicted the positions on the OTC molecule with high Fukui numbers that are suitable for attack by oxidants. CNBC-30 was stable for OTC degradation after four cycles with a degradation efficiency of above 78%, demonstrating its durability and potential for practical applications.

This study aimed to elucidate the droplet detachment mechanism in MCAW using numerical simulations. It was observed that in the initial stage of droplet growth, the argon arc attachment (which carried a large portion of the current) was located on the metal sheath surrounding the unmelted flux. Moreover, an eddy containing an upward flow at the wire axis was formed inside the droplet. When this eddy was formed, the droplet volume increased owing to wire melting. However, neck formation did not occur. This is considered to be because only a small portion of the current is conducted through the droplet, and the Lorentz force acting on the droplet is significantly weak. Thereafter, when the droplet grew to a certain extent and the arc attachment moved below the unmelted flux position, the Lorentz force acted strongly and almost uniformly on the droplet. Accordingly, this eddy disappeared, and the flow abruptly transitioned to a downward unidirectional high-speed flow. Consequently, the droplet began to extend downward to form a neck, which caused it to detach. For these reasons, the time required for droplet detachment increased, and the metal transfer frequency decreased compared with the case of the solid wire. This explains the observation that globular transfer persists in metal-cored wires at currents higher than those for which the transition to spray transfer has occurred for solid wires. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Argon; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Lorentz force; Wire; 'current; Arc attachment; Arc-welding; Argon gas; Droplet detachment; Globular transfer; Metal cored wires; Solid wires; Spray transfer; Transfer modes; Drops","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University .; Funding text 2: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

The welding process was carried out at a welding current of 190, 220, 250, 280, and 310 A under an argon–CO<inf>2</inf> shielding gas mixture with six levels of CO<inf>2</inf> concentration of 0, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % for a parametric study. Unlike the conventional solid wire welding trend, where the droplet transfer frequency decreases with the increase in carbon dioxide concentration, an increase in metal transfer frequency was observed with the increase in CO<inf>2</inf> concentration from approximately 5 % to 20 %. The concentration reaching the maximum frequency was 20 % at 190 A, which decreased as the welding current increased, reaching 5 % at 310 A. Droplet initiation at the lower sheath end is succeeded by a gradual downward movement along the flux column's side after a few milliseconds. Upon reaching the lower end, the droplet forms a neck and undergoes separation. Thus, the length of the flux column directly impacts the duration of one droplet transfer cycle. The length was decreased by arc constriction when increasing CO<inf>2</inf> concentration appropriately to concentrate beneath the flux column or by increasing the welding current to raise the arc temperature, which contributed to melting and shortening the flux column. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arc plasma; Flux column; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfer; Metal vapor; Rutile flux-cored wire; Shielding gas","Argon; Carbon dioxide; Drops; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Laser beam welding; Oxide minerals; Shielding; Titanium alloys; Wire; Arc plasma; Arc-welding; CO 2 concentration; Droplet transfer; Flux column; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfers; Metal vapor; Rutile flux cored wires; Shielding gas; Titanium dioxide","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

We found that CIDWM in the Pt/GdFeCo wire exhibits nearly two times smaller in critical current density and about four times larger in DW mobility compared to the Rh/GdFeCo wire. By measuring the CIDWM under a longitudinal in-plane magnetic field, the DMI constant (D) was estimated for both wires. The estimated value of D for the Pt/GdFeCo wire is approximately seven times larger than the Rh/GdFeCo wire. It indicated that the Pt/GdFeCo wire revealed the CIDWM with much higher efficiency, mainly attributed to the much larger DMI, which may come from significantly stronger interfacial heavy metal/ferrimagnet hybridization in the Pt/GdFeCo wire. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Critical current density (superconductivity); Ferrimagnetism; Magnetic anisotropy; Platinum compounds; Rhodium; Rhodium compounds; Spin dynamics; 'current; Current-induced domain wall motions; Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction; Ferrimagnetics; Ferrimagnets; Higher efficiency; Hybridisation; In-plane magnetic fields; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Spin orbits; Wire","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, under Grant No. KHCBVL.02/22-23.

Aqueous iodine batteries (AIBs) with reversible iodine redox activity are considered a viable candidate for stationary energy storage units and thus have recently drawn extensive research interest.

Taking advantage of enhanced kinetics facilitated by I<inf>2</inf>/2I− redox activity, our suggested AMIBs can be electrochemically charged/discharged with only a 6 % loss in capacity after 2,000 cycles at a low current density of 0.3 A g−1 in an AC||AC coin cell configuration. Moreover, the AC||Zn−Mn hybrid full-cell configuration is also established with AC and a Zn−Mn anode involving the NMC electrolyte, which retains a high energy of 185 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 2,600 W kg−1.

The result shows that high adsorption energies for indole are obtained at the deprotonated μ<inf>3</inf>-O, followed by unsaturated Zr-cation sites in defective UiO-66 structures. The key interactions are the hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen donor NH group of indole with the negative charge oxygen atom of the induced μ<inf>3</inf>-O site and the dative covalent bond between the nitrogen atom of indole with the unsaturated Zr-cation. For hydrogen bonding, the binding energies tend to increase with the increasing of defect concentrations and spread a broad range up to ≈−2.00 eV. It is also shown that the vibrational modes of indole molecules are influenced by their adsorption sites. Accordingly, the NH stretching modes of the adsorbed indole are redshifted ≈100–300 cm−1 compared to its counterpart in the isolated indole. The strongest redshift is obtained for indole adsorbed at the μ<inf>3</inf>-O site with three missing linkers.

In the pretreatment, SCB is processed to break down the cellulose-lignin-hemicellulose matrix and isolate components. This work proposes a formic/peroxyformic acid process for extracting cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from SCB. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (ss- 13C NMR) were employed to evidence the removal of wax, hemicellulose, and lignin from the raw SCB. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used for analyzing crystallinity, morphology, and thermal properties. SEM results showed that after lignin removal, the size of purified cellulose fibrils decreased significantly, and the structure of cellulose microfibers became smoother and more apparent. After acid hydrolysis of bleached cellulose microfibers, XRD analysis showed CNCs had the highest crystallinity (70.8 %). In TEM images, rod-like structures of CNCs were measured to be 23 ± 2.7 nm wide and 610 ± 18 nm long. The eco-friendly formic/peroxyformic acid procedure with a chlorine-free bleaching stage produced a white, cellulose-rich solid powder of CNCs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellulose microfibers; Cellulose nanocrystals; Formic/peroxyformic acid process; Sugarcane bagasse","Bagasse; Bleaching; Cleaning; Crystallinity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lignin; Nanocrystals; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermodynamic properties; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Acid process; Biomass source; Break down; Cellulose extraction; Cellulose microfiber; Formic/peroxyformic acid process; matrix; Micro-fiber; Pre-treatments; Sugar-cane bagasse; Cellulose; Gravimetry; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Thermal Analysis","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2021-18\u201324.

This study therefore aims to investigate the chemical compositions of indoor and outdoor PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>0.1</inf> in residential and school buildings in Vietnam during different seasons and the effects of emission sources on particle characteristics. The results show that the concentration of indoor PM<inf>2.5</inf> in the residential house was higher than that outdoors, and the indoor-to-outdoor ratios (I/O) exceeded 1, indicating the contribution of indoor sources. The peak concentration of indoor particles was observed during the incense burning days, whereas a higher indoor organic carbon concentration may be due to cooking activities. A similar variation of indoor and outdoor PM<inf>2.5</inf> indicates the penetration of outdoor particles. In the school building, seasonal variations in indoor PM<inf>0.1</inf> and its chemical species were observed, suggesting outdoor sources had a significant effect. Several factors may affect I/O and the infiltration factor of PM<inf>0.1</inf>, such as indoor sources, air exchange rate, cracks in the door and window, and particle deposition rate. The reason for the I/O value slightly above 1 for PM<inf>0.1</inf> in this study remained unclear. Further investigations are recommended to obtain knowledge regarding the penetration of particles, particularly PM<inf>0.1</inf>.

Photovoltaic energy is influenced by weather conditions and cloud movement, constituting the primary factors contributing to stochastic characteristics and uncertainty in predictive accuracy. Consequently, recent studies have focused on developing forecasting methods that utilize weather factors or nearby farms as multi-variable inputs. This study introduces several challenges, and one of the most significant goals is to capture the correlation between data series (spatial feature) and temporal correlation within each series (temporal feature) simultaneously. However, most previous work has concentrated solely on the time or frequency domain. This work presents a novel approach based on the spectral and frequency domain, which efficiently captures spatial–temporal correlations via Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). In this manner, spatial correlations are clearly represented via the adjacency matrix of GFT, and temporal correlations are clarified via DFT. The study provides specific evidence concerning the interpretability and extraction efficiency of the adjacency matrix in the context of multi-variable, single-site, and multi-site data.

We aimed to investigate whether this is a more general trait independent of ethnicity, or specific to a geographic region. We, therefore, assessed taste recognition thresholds for basic tastes: sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami, in a Southeast Asian population, and more specifically in the Vietnamese. The thresholds were measured in two conditions: when participants had their eyes open, and when blindfolded. Participants recognized sweet taste at a lower recognition threshold (lower sucrose concentration) when they were blindfolded than when their eyes were open (2.76 g/l and 3.80 g/l of sucrose, respectively, p = 0.024). Only sweet taste was sensitive to temporal visual deprivation; recognition thresholds for bitter, salty, sour and umami did not differ between the two experimental conditions. These results are consistent with those obtained previously in the Central European population, which suggests that the sensitivity of sweet taste – and only sweet taste out of the five basic taste modalities – to temporal visual deprivation could be a general trait independent of a geographic region and ethnicity. Our results suggest that a visual component could have a different share of the coding of different taste modalities in taste-responsive brain regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blindfolded; Ethnicity; Sweet; Taste recognition threshold; Visual deprivation","","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Institutional Funds of the School of Biotechnology and Food Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology , and funded by the European Union .; Funding text 2: The authors thank Dr Cung To Quynh, Dr Nguyen Thi Thao, MSc Nguyen Thi Lan Anh, MSc Bui Uyen Diem, and students of the School of Biotechnology and Food Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology for their invaluable help with participants recruitment, data collection, and comments.

In the proposed method, both capacitance and dc-offset voltage of the decoupling capacitors are designed unbalanced with the bottom capacitor having a dominant effect over the top one, which reduces the decoupling capacitance requirements compared to the previous works. In addition, the effect of lower dc-link capacitance in reducing power rating of the precharge resistor, typically used in OBC applications, is presented. This effect, overlooked in previous literature, leads to reducing volume and cost of the OBC. A small signal model of the HSC-PD is introduced, and a modified feedback control strategy is proposed, offering lower memory usage and calculation effort for the digital signal processor (DSP) microcontroller when compared with conventional proportional resonant (PR) controllers. The comparisons of the proposed method with other HSC-PD counterparts as well as with the conventional E-cap method are given. Finally, a 7.4-kW prototype of an 820-V interleaved totem-pole power factor correction (PFC) with an HSC-PD is built and tested to verify the superior performance of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","800-V electric vehicles; electrolytic capacitor (E-cap); half-bridge split capacitor; on-board battery charger (OBC); power decoupling (PD)","Capacitance; Controllers; Digital control systems; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric vehicles; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; Secondary batteries; 800v electric vehicle; Battery; Capacitor power; Electrolytic capacitor;; Frequency control; Half-bridge; Half-bridge split capacitor; OBC;; Power decoupling; Power decoupling;; Electrolytic capacitors","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DN2022-20-04.","Barroso, Daniel Goretti L., Electrified Automotive Propulsion Systems: State-of-the-Art Review, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 8, 2, pp. 2898-2914, (2022); Park, Yongwan, DAB Converter for EV Onboard Chargers Using Bare-Die SiC MOSFETs and Leakage-Integrated Planar Transformer, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 8, 1, pp. 209-224, (2022); Yilmaz, Murat, Review of battery charger topologies, charging power levels, and infrastructure for plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 5, pp. 2151-2169, (2013); Global Ev Outlook 2022, (2022); Khaligh, Alireza, Global Trends in High-Power On-Board Chargers for Electric Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 68, 4, pp. 3306-3324, (2019); Oh, Chang-yeol, A high-efficient nonisolated single-stage on-board battery charger for electric vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 28, 12, pp. 5746-5757, (2013); Li, Bin, Bi-directional on-board charger architecture and control for achieving ultra-high efficiency with wide battery voltage range, Conference Proceedings - IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC, pp. 3688-3694, (2017); Zhang, Zhengda, High-Efficiency High-Power-Density CLLC Resonant Converter with Low-Stray-Capacitance and Well-Heat-Dissipated Planar Transformer for EV On-Board Charger, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 35, 10, pp. 10831-10851, (2020); Lu, Jiangheng, Dynamic Strategy for Efficiency Estimation in a CCM-Operated Front-End PFC Converter for Electric Vehicle Onboard Charger, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 3, 3, pp. 545-553, (2017); Musavi, Fariborz, Evaluation and efficiency comparison of front end AC-DC plug-in hybrid charger topologies, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 1, pp. 413-421, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23327782","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166782732"

However, two significant obstacles still need to be addressed, including the low ionic conductivities and the low interfacial contact between ASSB components. This study involves the fabrication of hexagonal CuS nanoparticles by a one-step hydrothermal method and uses them for both cathode and solid electrolyte formulation functions. The reasonable ionic conductivity of 4.68 × 10−4 S.cm−1 at 60℃ and the instant transport number of 0.86 of the designed CuS filler-incorporated solid electrolyte offered great promise for ASSBs applications. In particular, the CuS filler-incorporated solid electrolyte exhibited ceaseless and prompt Li-ion transportation kinetics and delivered a dendrite resistance capability over 200 cycles of stripping/plating of Li. In addition, the Li metal solid-state battery is also verified using CuS as the cathode and SPE electrolyte (PEO/LiTFSI/CuS SPE) system. It offers an initial discharge capacity of up to 695 mAh/g and keeps an average capacity of ∼ 365 mAh/g after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.5C. Thus, this study introduced a simple but effective solution to mitigate the dendrite problems associated with solid polymer electrolytes by using CuS as a durable inactive filler. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CuS cathode; CuS filler-solid electrolyte; Ionic conductivity; Lithium dendrites","Cathodes; Copper compounds; Filled polymers; Fillers; Ionic conduction in solids; Ionic conductivity; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanoparticles; Polyelectrolytes; Solid state devices; Solid-State Batteries; Sulfur compounds; All-solid-state battery; All-solid-state lithium battery; Bi-functional; CuS cathode; CuS filler-solid electrolyte; Electrolyte additives; Lithium dendrite; Performance; Solid polymer electrolytes; Two in ones; Solid electrolytes","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-XS-001.","Front Batter Electrochem, (2022); Frontiers in Batteries and Electrochemistry, (2022); Soundharrajan, Vaiyapuri, LiV3O8 as an intercalation-type cathode for aqueous aluminum-ion batteries, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 10, 35, pp. 18162-18169, (2022); Kim, Seokhun, Microwave-assisted rapid synthesis of nh4v4o10 layered oxide: A high energy cathode for aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries, Nanomaterials, 11, 8, (2021); Nithiananth, Subramanian, Transition divalent metal substitution in chalcopyrite CuInSe2 (In = Co, Ni, and Mn) counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cell applications, Materials Letters, 308, (2022); Frontiers in Batteries and Electrochemistry, (2024); Pillai, Akhilash Mohanan, Surface Modification on Nickel Rich Cathode Materials for Lithium-Ion Cells: A Mini Review, Chemical Record, 23, 11, (2023); Pillai, Akhilash Mohanan, Synthesis and characterization of Li1.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2: A high-capacity cathode material with improved thermal stability and rate capability for lithium-ion cells, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 938, (2023); Soundharrajan, Vaiyapuri, Bitter gourd-shaped Ni3V2O8 anode developed by a one-pot metal-organic framework-combustion technique for advanced Li-ion batteries, Ceramics International, 43, 16, pp. 13224-13232, (2017); Soundharrajan, Vaiyapuri, Facile green synthesis of a Co3V2O8 nanoparticle electrode for high energy lithium-ion battery applications, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 501, pp. 133-141, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15726657","","JECHE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189503203"

In this study, three metabolites of OPEs including bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) and diethyl phosphate (DEP) were investigated in first-morning void urine samples taken from a population (age range: 3–76 years old) in Hanoi, Vietnam. The most dominant urinary OPE metabolite was DEP with the geometric mean of specific gravity adjust (SG-adjusted) concentration were 1960 ng mL−1 and detected frequency (DF) of 98%. Followed by DPhP (8.01 ng mL−1, DF: 100%) and BDCIPP (2.18 ng mL−1, DF: 51%). The results indicated that gender and age might have associations with the OPE metabolites variation in urine samples. The levels of OPE metabolites in urine samples from females were slightly higher than in males. An increase in age seems to have an association with a decrease in DPhP levels in urine. Exposure doses of parent OPEs were evaluated from the unadjusted urinary concentration of corresponding OPE metabolite. The estimated exposure doses of triethyl phosphate (TEP) (mean: 534,000 ng kg−1 d−1) were significantly higher than its corresponding reference dose, suggesting the high potential risk from the current exposure doses of TEP to human health. The results of this work provided the initial information on the occurrence of three OPE metabolites in urine from Hanoi, Vietnam and estimated exposure dose of corresponding parent OPEs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","bis(1,3 dichloro 2 propyl) phosphate; creatine; diethyl phosphate; diphenyl phosphate; ester; organophosphate; phosphate; unclassified drug; age structure; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; gender discrimination; pollution exposure; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; urine; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; chemical parameters; child; estimated daily intake; female; female worker; human; male; relative density; sex difference; urine sampling; Viet Nam; work environment; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; middle aged; pollutant; preschool child; young adult; Hanoi; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Esters; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organophosphates; Vietnam; Young Adult","","creatine, 57-00-1; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; Environmental Pollutants; Esters; Organophosphates","The Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology provided funding for this study under Grant No. \""T\u0110PCCC.05/21-23\"".","Al-Omran, Layla Salih, Organophosphate esters in indoor and outdoor dust from Iraq: Implications for human exposure, Emerging Contaminants, 7, pp. 204-212, (2021); Am J Biomed Sci Res, (2019); Berghuis, Sietske Annette, Developmental neurotoxicity of persistent organic pollutants: an update on childhood outcome, Archives of Toxicology, 89, 5, pp. 687-709, (2015); Braun, Joseph M., Variability and predictors of urinary bisphenol a concentrations during pregnancy, Environmental Health Perspectives, 119, 1, pp. 131-137, (2011); Butt, Craig M., Metabolites of organophosphate flame retardants and 2-ethylhexyl tetrabromobenzoate in urine from paired mothers and toddlers, Environmental Science and Technology, 48, 17, pp. 10432-10438, (2014); Butt, Craig M., Regional comparison of organophosphate flame retardant (PFR) urinary metabolites and tetrabromobenzoic acid (TBBA) in mother-toddler pairs from California and New Jersey, Environment International, 94, pp. 627-634, (2016); Cequier, Enrique, Human exposure pathways to organophosphate triesters - A biomonitoring study of mother-child pairs, Environment International, 75, pp. 159-165, (2015); Chen, Yi, Urinary metabolites of organophosphate esters in children in South China: Concentrations, profiles and estimated daily intake, Environmental Pollution, 235, pp. 358-364, (2018); Chen, Zhikun, Sources, behaviors, transformations, and environmental risks of organophosphate esters in the coastal environment: A review, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 180, (2022); Choo, Gyojin, Seasonal occurrence and removal of organophosphate esters in conventional and advanced drinking water treatment plants, Water Research, 186, (2020)","","Springer","","","","","","14320703; 00904341","","AECTC","38664242","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191490059"

Observation-based precipitation data usually come from two primary sources, namely gauges and satellite images. The former provides high reliability but sparse coverage, while the latter offers fine-grained data but is still inaccurate. There have been several efforts to estimate precipitation, including mathematical and probabilistic models and machine learning-based techniques. All existing solutions consider the target problem as a satellite data calibration with gauge data as complementary information. However, this approach fails to provide accurate predictive results due to the sparsity of gauges and significant errors in satellite data. This paper presents a novel precipitation estimating method that highlights the importance of gauge data, the most trustworthy data source. To be more precise, we formulate the precipitation estimation issue as a spatial prediction task with the goal of predicting rainfall data for non-monitoring locations using gauge data at the monitored sites. To this end, we propose a data-driven approach that exploits the encoder–decoder architecture, graph neural network, and the multimodal data fusion strategy. Specifically, we design an encoder that leverages a graph neural network for capturing the spatial relationship among the gauges. Meanwhile, the decoder exploits the convolutional networks to learn the temporal correlation within the historical data. Finally, we integrate satellite images and meteorological information using a multimodal data fusion based on a multilayer perceptron to enhance prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that our proposed model increases the estimation accuracy from 24.3 to 65.2% compared to the state-of-the-art. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Encoder–decoder; Graph neural networks; Precipitation estimation; Spatiotemporal prediction","Data fusion; Decoding; Forecasting; Gages; Multilayer neural networks; Network coding; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Satellites; Data-driven approach; Encoder-decoder; Flood warning; Fresh Water; Graph neural networks; Multimodal data fusion; Precipitation estimation; Satellite data; Satellite images; Spatio-temporal prediction; Image enhancement","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under grant number T2022-PC-049.

Natural rubber-grafted-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with a special nanostructure was synthesized by graft copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) onto the surface of natural rubber (NR) particles using tert-butylhydroperoxide/tetraethylenepentamine as initiators. Optimal conditions for achieving high conversion and grafting efficiency were identified. Characterization of the as-synthesized samples was performed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, tensile measurement, swelling degree determination, and cytotoxicity testing. The results revealed that HEMA formed a nanoscale matrix surrounding NR particles, which improved the tensile strength, thermal resistance, and swelling degree of the as-prepared samples. Cytotoxicity testing demonstrated that the membrane was safe for human use, as it did not exhibit toxicity to Vero cells at concentrations up to 1024 µg/mL. Furthermore, the membrane displayed a high adsorption capacity toward Fe3+ and was well described by Koble-Corrigan isotherm model and the first–second-order kinetic equation. Moreover, the membrane demonstrated excellent recyclability maintaining its adsorption ability towards Fe3+ ions over five consecutive cycles.

This study aimed to develop a cost-effective method for fabricating porous CO<inf>3</inf>Ap blocks while maintaining a balance between porosity and mechanical properties. The level of interconnectivity in the porous structure was achieved by adjusting the pore volume fractions of the starting materials. The phase and microstructure characteristics of the porous CO<inf>3</inf>Ap blocks were assessed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The diametral tensile strength (DTS) of the blocks was determined using a universal testing machine. The results demonstrated that the mechanical strength of the blocks stayed within a range that was suitable for handling properties. This advantage allows the porous blocks to withstand initial stress during implantation procedures or in the early stages of defect healing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbonate apatite; Dissolution–precipitation; Interconnected pore; Mechanical strength","Apatite; Carbonation; Cost effectiveness; Fabrication; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Medical applications; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Tissue regeneration; Artificial bones; Biomedical applications; Bone substitutes; Carbonate apatite; Chemical compositions; Dissolution precipitations; Hard tissues; Interconnected pores; Mechanical; Mechanical strength; Porosity","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C-2022–20-24.","LeGeros, Racquel Zapanta, Apatite crystallites: Effects of carbonate on morphology, Science, 155, 3768, pp. 1409-1411, (1967); Deguchi, Kaai, Effects of the carbonate content in carbonate apatite on bone replacement, Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, 16, 2, pp. 200-206, (2022); Ishikawa, Kunio, Carbonate apatite artificial bone, Science and Technology of Advanced Materials, 22, 1, pp. 683-694, (2021); Hasegawa, Masahiro, Cell-mediated bioresorption of sintered carbonate apatite in rabbits, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 85, 1, pp. 142-147, (2003); Cahyanto, Arief, Fabrication of bone cement that fully transforms to carbonate apatite, Dental Materials Journal, 34, 3, pp. 394-401, (2015); Darus, Fadilah, Enhancement of carbonate apatite scaffold properties with surface treatment and alginate and gelatine coating, Journal of Porous Materials, 27, 3, pp. 831-842, (2020); Madupalli, Honey, Carbonate substitution in the mineral component of bone: Discriminating the structural changes, simultaneously imposed by carbonate in A and B sites of apatite, Journal of Solid State Chemistry, 255, pp. 27-35, (2017); Kim, Young-seok, Effect of nano-carbonate apatite to prevent re-stain after dental bleaching in vitro, Journal of Dentistry, 39, 9, pp. 636-642, (2011); Nagai, Hirokazu, Effects of low crystalline carbonate apatite on proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of human bone marrow cells, Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine, 26, 2, (2015); Hayashi, Koichiro, Granular honeycomb scaffolds composed of carbonate apatite for simultaneous intra- and inter-granular osteogenesis and angiogenesis, Materials Today Bio, 14, (2022)","","Springer","","","","","","25101579; 25101560","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173965542"

With the direct coupled system, the power loss and external price on auxiliary devices are avoided. However, the adaptability of the direct coupled system to fluctuate solar irradiance and ambient temperature is reduced significantly compared to systems with DC-DC converters. To maximise the system efficiency, the optimal electrolyser (ELY) cell configuration is identified using an optimal sizing approach or operating strategy. This paper applied the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to find the optimal configuration for the two approaches, namely the Sizing technique and Operating strategy under different PV systems: faults, degradation and partial shading conditions. Additionally, a large-scale system is simulated to describe the characteristics of a large-scale direct coupled PV-electrolyser system with actual operating faults and phenomena. Simulations of the large-scale direct coupling system were conducted using measured irradiance and temperature data for a typical day period. Based on the collected output, it is found that compared to the optimal sizing approach, the optimal operating strategy allows the direct coupled system to increase its coupling efficiency from 0.17% to 4.47%. In contrast, the amount of hydrogen production when applying the two methods witnessed different trends, depending on the type of faults. The differences are even more significantly presented during multiple short-circuit fault scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Direct coupling; Electrolyser; Hydrogen; Partial shading; PV faults","","","","The authors of this article want to express their gratitude to the individuals from the 100% Renewable Energy Lab at Hanoi University of Science and Technology for their support during the article's drafting phase.

Using the Ar50(p,pn) reaction channel in inverse kinematics, Ar50 projectiles at 217 MeV/nucleon impinged on a 150 mm long liquid hydrogen target, part of the MINOS device. Prompt deexcitation γ rays were measured with the NaI(Tl) array DALI2+. Reaction products were analyzed with the SAMURAI spectrometer, which allowed the measurement of the momentum distributions and angular momentum transfer. Data were compared to state-of-the-art theoretical predictions, including shell-model, energy-density functional, and ab initio calculations.

Gasification was carried out employing a 20 kWe commercial gasification system with macadamia nut shell, bagasse, and rice straw. Subsequently, post-gasification residues were meticulously collected, analyzed and utilized for CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption experiments. Among these residual chars, macadamia nut shell demonstrated the highest CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption capacity, followed by bagasse, while rice straw showed moderate performance. In laboratory conditions (25 °C, 1 bar, without the influence of ambient moisture or CO<inf>2</inf> diffusion constraint), the post-gasification residue from macadamia nut shell achieved a CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption capacity of 2.8 mmol g−1, followed by bagasse (2.4 mmol g−1). Transitioning to more practical conditions (25 °C, 1 bar, considering the influence of ambient moisture and CO<inf>2</inf> diffusion limitations within an adsorbent bed), the macadamia nut shell and bagasse residual chars reached 2.7 mmol g−1 and 2.3 mmol g−1, respectively. Moreover, these chars exhibited noteworthy CO<inf>2</inf>/N<inf>2</inf> selectivity and recyclability, making them comparable to various advanced CO<inf>2</inf> adsorbents investigated in prior studies. The superior performance of the macadamia nut shell-derived residual char can be attributed to its highest microporous/ultra-microporous volumes and concentrations of basic and aromatic functional groups on the char's surface. The results of this study open up the potential for different strategies in combining the production of energy and affordable and upscalable CO<inf>2</inf> adsorbents for industrial applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Agricultural residues; CO2 uptake; Gasification; Residual char","Adsorption; Agriculture; Bagasse; Carbon dioxide; Gasification; Moisture; Shells (structures); Adsorption capacities; Ambient moisture; CO 2 diffusion; CO 2 uptake; Experimental investigations; Macadamia nuts; Nut-shells; Performance; Residual char; Rice straws; Agricultural wastes","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the International Cooperation Bilateral Program on Science and Technology between Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) - Vietnam and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) - Japan, Mission Code: QTJP01 . 02/22-24 (Vietnamese side); JPJSBP120229602 (Japanese side).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the International Cooperation Bilateral Program on Science and Technology between Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) - Vietnam and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) - Japan, Mission Code: QTJP01.02/22-24 (Vietnamese side); JPJSBP120229602 (Japanese side).","Vietnam J Agric Sci, (2020); Foo, K.

Therefore, it is regarded as a potentially promising substitute for natural sand in the ground improvement using the sand compaction pile (SCP) method. Due to the relatively rapid solidification, however, which is induced by the latent hydraulic property of GBFS, the permeability of the installed GBFS compaction pile (GBFSCP) decreases quickly, and such an application becomes difficult for the case of SCP with low sand replacement area ratio (LSRAR). So, to decelerate the permeability reduction of GBFSCP, different GBFSs, and natural sands were collected in Japan and Vietnam, and the specimens were prepared by changing the mixing ratio of sand to GBFS from 20% to 80%. Then, firstly, fundamental geotechnical properties of sand-mixed GBFS without hydration were observed. Secondly, the specimens of sand-GBFS mixture were cured in seawater at the temperature of 80°C for 3 days to 380 days. The unconfined compressive strength, permeability, and hydration reaction rate of the hydrated sand-mixed GBFS specimen were measured. In conclusion, the geotechnical properties of the unhydrated sand-mixed GBFS become more advantageous than those of natural sand. In addition, by mixing with natural sand, the hydration reaction rate and the solidification of GBFS are controlled. This means that it is possible to keep the compressive strength and the permeability at the predetermined conditions and, in turn, to satisfy requirements for the SCP method with LSRAR. In addition, a simple estimation method of the unconfined compressive strength was proposed for the hydrated sand-mixed GBFS specimen. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geotechnical properties; granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS); hydraulic property; permeability; sand compaction pile; unconfined compressive strength","","","","This research was supported by Hue University through the Core Research Program, with Grant No. NCM.DHH.2018.03 and Grant No. DHH2021-01-185.

The rates of cell-voltage degradation and coke formation of the ESC with the Ni/CZ(F)-PSC during 100 h of operation were 4.3% kh−1 and 0.43 mg-C g-PSC−1 h−1, respectively, which were lower than those of an ESC with a Ni-loaded PSC without the CZ(F) dispersion (10.4% kh−1 and 8.1 mg-C g-PSC−1 h−1, respectively). This performance improvement is attributed to the unique porous morphology and high oxygen storage capacity of CZ(F), which can contribute to the prevention of Ni agglomeration and the removal of coke from the catalyst surface, respectively. Thus, the Ni/CZ(F)-PSC can function as a practically applicable reforming domain for an internal-reforming biogas-fueled SOFC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ceria–zirconia solid solution; flowerlike ceria; internal reforming; paper-structured catalyst; solid oxide fuel cell","Biogas; Catalysts; Coke; Dispersions; Electrolytes; Gas fuel purification; Morphology; Open circuit voltage; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Zirconia; Ceria zirconia solid solution; Ceria-based oxides; Electrolyte-supported cells; Flowerlike ceria; Internal reforming; Oxide supports; Paper-structured catalyst; Performance; Solid-oxide fuel cell; Structured catalyst; Cerium oxide","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Fostering Joint International Research (B) (grant number 20KK0248).

Consequently, low-cost air monitoring devices have emerged as a potential alternative to expensive conventional ones. However, the low-cost devices’ major drawback is their insufficient level of accuracy. This work investigates the problem of calibrating the sensory data, especially PM2.5 concentration, collected by low-cost sensor-based air quality monitoring devices. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a potential solution for data calibration instead of using traditional methods, whose accuracy is relatively low. Nevertheless, it generally incurs significant costs. Moreover, it is necessary to employ a dedicated calibration model for each device to increase precision, resulting in additional expenditures. To address the issue, this study provides a novel approach named GAMMA, which entails the development of a deep learning-based model capable of accurately calibrating data for multiple devices simultaneously. The proposed method leverages the multitask learning paradigm to solve the challenge of concurrently processing several devices’ data. This involves capturing common features across all devices’ data while also distinguishing the device-specific characteristics. Furthermore, GAMMA also employs the adversarial training approach to augment the accuracy of predictions. This method has been implemented and integrated into an air quality monitoring system in Hanoi, Vietnam. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world data to demonstrate the superiority of GAMMA against the comparison benchmarks in terms of various metrics. Notably, GAMMA reduces MAE from 60.19% to 74.09% compared to the best comparison baseline.

A meridional chain of ground observatories along 95°E ± 10°E (conjugate point-GNSS receiver/Ionosonde), satellite in-situ measurements (SWARM/COSMIC/C-NOFS), and Total Electron Content maps are utilized. Symmetric negative (positive) effects were noted during the main phase of the June (December) storm but hemispheric asymmetry was manifested during the recovery phase. The quiet time hemispheric asymmetry was reversed during both storms with positive TEC effects on the winter side. Differential VTEC and NmF2 responses exhibited seasonal variation. On 23 June 2015, the VTEC enhancements in the southern low latitude were large and consistent in contrast to the weak response in NmF2. In contrast, during the December storm, the NmF2 depletion in southern low latitude was more severe than the corresponding depletion in VTEC. The topside density/TEC enhancement in the southern low latitude recorded by SWARM was much higher than 300 % during the morning of 23 June. The SWARM Ne/TEC profile as well as the ground GPS TEC map showed a third latitudinal maximum around −45° dip angle of field lines in southern low latitudes on 23 June, in addition to the conventional EIA crests. Similarly, an early morning maximum was recorded at + 45° dip (northern hemisphere) on 21 December. The hmF2 measured by the southern hemisphere ionosonde and COSMIC satellite showed an anomalously higher altitude of the F2-layer on 23 June while C/NOFS recorded equator-ward meridional flow velocity. The reversal of the hemispheric asymmetry and the additional storm time transient maximum on the winter side is attributed to the equator-ward winds surge in the winter hemisphere due to storm time heating of the polar region. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetry; EIA; Storm; Wind","Cosmology; Flow velocity; Geomagnetism; Global positioning system; Ionosphere; Asymmetry; Conjugate points; EIA; Geomagnetic storm; GNSS receivers; Hemi-spheric asymmetries; In-situ measurement; Low latitudes; Symmetrics; Total electron content; Storms","","","Funding text 1: The study is sponsored by the ISRO RESPOND funding grant no: ISRO/RES/2/421/18–19.

In the proposed control strategy, low-pass filters are integrated into each virtual control input, and a powerful backstepping controller with integrated tracking error action is utilized. An integral backstepping control (IBSP) integrator is added to improve the system’s robustness to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The low pass filter of dynamic surface control (DSC) based on an integral backstepping algorithm is adopted, from which the proposed control strategy improves steady-state accuracy and eliminates the derivative explosion phenomenon. Furthermore, non-linear lumped disturbance observers (NLDO) are used for axial displacement and rotation speed control loop to improve system stability by minimizing the impact of disturbances such as parameter uncertainties, unknown load torque and force, and unmodeled dynamics acting on the control system.

Utilizing recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) obtained from construction and demolition waste as a replacement for natural aggregates has become an effective solution for environmental sustainability. However, the inevitably diminished characteristics of the adhered mortar and the existence of an additional interfacial transition zone (ITZ) have negatively suppressed the widespread use of these materials in production lines. The present study aims to comprehensively investigate the effects of a cement-fly ash slurry with a mass ratio of 50% of the total weight of RCA on the microstructure and engineering properties of RCA derived from three different parent concretes with strength grades of 20, 30, and 60 MPa. The RCAs were soaked for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h to evaluate the long-term effects of the pozzolanic slurry. A sequence of laboratory tests was conducted, including mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) test, thermal gravimetric–differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses, and measurements of water absorption and crushing value. The MIP results demonstrated a significant increase in medium capillary and gel pores, and a reduction in large capillary pores in the RCA with an increase in soaking time. TG-DTA results indicated an increase in Ca(OH)<inf>2</inf> content during the first 24 h and 48 h of treatment. However, after 72 h of treatment, the Ca(OH)<inf>2</inf> content of the treated RCA decreased in all cases. XRD analysis revealed the appearance of a few additional ettringite peaks among the treated RCAs in all cases. SEM images demonstrated the presence of additional hydration products after treatment, which filled the pores and improved the surface texture. Furthermore, after treatment, the crushing value of all treated RCA decreased by 6.0–27.1%, whereas the water absorption decreased by 12.0–30.9% compared to the untreated RCA. Based on several experimental results, the formation of hydration products and the improvement mechanism of RCA from three different parent concretes by slurry treatment with different soaking durations were discussed. In conclusion, a prolonged impregnation time of 72 h yielded a dominant performance, effectively intensifying their inferior properties, regardless of the initial strength grade of parent concrete. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ca(OH)2 content; Crushing value; Improvement mechanism; Phase compositions; Pore structure; Pozzolanic slurry; Recycled concrete aggregate; Surface texture; Surface treatment; Water absorption","Concrete aggregates; Crushing; Demolition; Differential thermal analysis; Fly ash; Hydrated lime; Hydration; Image enhancement; Pore structure; Pozzolanic materials; Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Water absorption; Water treatment; X ray diffraction; Ca(OH)2 content; Crushing value; Fly ash slurries; Improvement mechanism; Performance; Pores structure; Pozzolanic; Pozzolanic slurry; Recycled concrete aggregates; Surface textures; Surface treatment","","","We acknowledge Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for supporting this study.","Shaban, Wafaa Mohamed, Quality improvement techniques for recycled concrete aggregate: A review, Journal of Advanced Concrete Technology, 17, 4, pp. 151-167, (2019); Otsuki, Nobuaki, Influence of recycled aggregate on interfacial transition zone, strength, chloride penetration and carbonation of concrete, Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 15, 5, pp. 443-451, (2003); Int J Eng Res Technol, (2013); McNeil, Katrina, Recycled Concrete Aggregates: A Review, International Journal of Concrete Structures and Materials, 7, 1, pp. 61-69, (2013); Ahmad, Waqas, Sustainable approach of using sugarcane bagasse ash in cement-based composites: A systematic review, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 15, (2021); Bravo, Miguel, On the development of a technical specification for the use of fine recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste in concrete production, Materials, 13, 19, (2020); Bravo, Miguel, Tests and simulation of the bond-slip between steel and concrete with recycled aggregates from CDW, Buildings, 11, 2, pp. 1-21, (2021); Revilla-Cuesta, Víctor, Using recycled aggregate concrete at a precast-concrete plant: A multi-criteria company-oriented feasibility study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 373, (2022); Revilla-Cuesta, Víctor, Self-compacting concrete with recycled concrete aggregate subjected to alternating-sign temperature variations: Thermal strain and damage, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 17, (2022); Hasan, Zaid Ali, Studying the mechanical properties of mortar containing different waste materials as a partial replacement for aggregate, International Review of Civil Engineering, 10, 3, pp. 155-161, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09500618","","CBUME","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181043507"

Currently, the standardized PQC algorithms FIPS 203 (CRYSTALS-Kyber), FIPS 204 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), and the one in the process of being standardized FIPS 206 (FALCON) all use the NTT to perform polynomial multiplication. This paper proposes a high-speed, low-complexity, and run-time configurable accelerator that supports all three standards. Firstly, we propose a unified design using four parallel radix-2 butterflies targeting a high-speed polynomial multiplier. With a unified design, the accelerator performs NTT, inverse NTT (INTT), point-wise multiplication (PWM), and matrix-vector polynomial multiplication. Secondly, we propose a compact, configurable reordering unit for effective coefficient processing in high-parallelism. As a bonus, the required memory size is minimal, and the memory access pattern is straightforward. Finally, we present a RISC-V SoC architecture with a loosely coupled accelerator through register-map communication and the data flow to accelerate NTT-based operation in software. The FPGA implementation results show that the achieved speed for NTT/INTT/PWM executions is 224/224/64 clock cycles (CCs) for Kyber, 512/512/128 CCs for Dilithium, 576/576/128 CCs for FALCON-512, and 1280/1280/256 CCs for FALCON-1024, respectively. The Area × Time Product (ATP) results also show superiority over other algorithm-specific and configurable designs, achieving improvement up to 82%, 63%, 79%, and 50% for Kyber, Dilithium, FALCON-512, and FALCON-1024, respectively. The SoC implementation results show that the NTT-based operations have improved by up to 5.29 ×, 27.49×, 56.79×, and 58.91× in software; and speed-up up to 10.53×, 9.81×, 9.57×, and 9.99× for the considered algorithms compared to previous SW/HW works on RISC-V platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FIPS 203; FIPS 204; FIPS 206; number theoretic transform; polynomial multiplication; post-quantum cryptography; RISC-V; software/hardware","C (programming language); Conformal mapping; Integrated circuit design; Inverse transforms; Light velocity; Network coding; Network security; Parallel architectures; Polynomial approximation; Quantum electronics; Reconfigurable architectures; System-on-chip; Clock cycles; Dilithium; FIPS 203; FIPS 204; FIPS 206; Number-theoretic transforms; Polynomial multiplication; Post quantum cryptography; RISC-V; Software/hardware; Quantum cryptography","","","This work is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DN2024-18-02.","Shor, Peter W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - Proceedings, pp. 124-134, (1994); Status Report on the Third Round of the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process, (2022); Module Lattice Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism Standard, (2023); Module Lattice Based Digital Signature Standard, (2024); Falcon Fast Fourier Lattice Based Compact Signatures Over Ntru; Doklady Akad Nauk SSSR, (1962); Soviet Mathematics Doklady, (1963); Cook, Stephen A., On the minimum computation time of functions, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 142, pp. 291-314, (1969); Dam, Duc Thuan, A Survey of Post-Quantum Cryptography: Start of a New Race, Cryptography, 7, 3, (2023); Chung, Chi Ming Marvin, NTT multiplication for NTT-unfriendly rings: New Speed Records for Saber and NTRU on Cortex-M4 and AVX2, IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, 2021, 2, pp. 159-188, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212964258"

Previously published data on these mountains showed the presence of a rich and unique fauna of rodents and, especially, insectivores, but information about chiropterans for this territory has so far been fragmentary. Surveys carried out in March 2017 and April 2023 at altitudes ranging from 570 to 2300 m asl identifi ed at least 30 bat species from four families. Some of the species found are known in Indochina from isolated records and were fi rst discovered in Ha Giang Province. The bat fauna of Tay Con Linh includes both widespread, ecologically fl exible species (e.g., Cynopterus sphinx, Rhinolophus affi nis), as well as species of the Indo-Himalayan fauna that penetrate into the territory of Vietnam along mountain ranges (e.g., Mirostrellus joffrei), species which distribution patterns are not clear due to extremely fragmented ranges (e.g., Rhinolophus siamensis, Hipposideros khaokhouayensis, Arielulus cf. circumdatus), and at least one Palearctic species (Myotis altarium). At the same time, due to the absence of karstic caves on the massif, there are no species obligately associated with karst, and petrophilic species are generally few in number. Most of widespread species are confi ned to low and medium elevations. On the contrary, a number of species (Harpiola isodon, Murina chrysochaetes, M. huttoni, Myotis altarium, Arielulus cf. circumdatus, Mirostrellus joffrei) were found only at altitudes of 1700 m asl and higher. It is noteworthy that these species are also known from the more western provinces of northern Vietnam, which suggests that the Red River (Hong Ha) valley does not play any signifi cant role as an isolating barrier for bats. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chiroptera; Ha Giang Province; Hipposideridae; new records; North Vietnam; Pteropodidae; Rhinolophidae; Vespertilionidae; zoogeography","","","","We are grateful to all our colleagues who helped and supported us during the field work.

The availability of numerous free core designs leads to the pervasiveness of RISC-V-based devices on diverse applications spanning the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR). The increasing prevalence of RISC-V cores has consequently caused a demand for high-performance and resource-efficient multicore systems. However, while numerous proposals exist for constructing multicore systems on conventional architectures, realizing an efficient multicore system that effectively leverages the features of RISC-V remains a challenge. This paper introduces a novel hardware/software co-design methodology to address these bottlenecks while minimizing resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, exhibiting significant performance gains over single-Threaded implementations and even surpassing traditional multi-Threaded approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hardware-software co-design; multicore; multithread; RISC-V; task scheduling","Integrated circuit design; Open source software; Customizable; Hardware/software codesign; Instruction set architecture; Multi-core systems; Multi-cores; Multi-thread; Multithreaded; Open-source; RISC-V; Tasks scheduling; Hardware-software codesign","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DN2024-18-02.","Hung, Yiwen, An Energy-efficient and Programmable RISC-V CNN Coprocessor for Real-time Epilepsy Detection and Identification on Wearable Devices, (2021); Liang, Quanyi, Intelligent Home IoT Intrusion Detection System Based on RISC-V, pp. 296-300, (2023); Lee, Jaewon, RISC-V FPGA Platform Toward ROS-Based Robotics Application, (2020); Matthews, Eric, TAIGA: A new RISC-V soft-processor framework enabling high performance CPU architectural features, (2017); Miyazaki, Hiromu, RVCoreP: An optimized RISC-V soft processor of five-stage pipelining, IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, E103D, 12, pp. 2494-2503, (2020); Rossi, Davide, PULP: A parallel ultra low power platform for next generation IoT applications, (2015); Amid, Alon, Chipyard: Integrated Design, Simulation, and Implementation Framework for Custom SoCs, IEEE Micro, 40, 4, pp. 10-21, (2020); Conti, Francesco, Marsellus: A Heterogeneous RISC-V AI-IoT End-Node SoC With 2-8 b DNN Acceleration and 30%-Boost Adaptive Body Biasing, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 59, 1, pp. 128-142, (2024); Samie, Farzad, From cloud down to things: An overview of machine learning in internet of things, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 3, pp. 4921-4934, (2019); Wu, Fan, Design of RISC-V heterogeneous multi-core SOC architecture for edge computing for power applications, pp. 701-708, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211154639"

However, during the past decade, it was recognized on a molecular basis that long-legged ixodid ticks associated with bats may represent at least six species. Of these, until recently, five have been morphologically described. In this study, Ixodes ticks were collected from two Myotis species in southeastern Asia, Vietnam. Based on the morphological and molecular characteristics of the female, nymph and larva, Ixodes lanigeri Hornok, sp. nov. is described here. The male is unknown. Like other members of the Ixodes ariadnae complex, I. lanigeri Hornok apparently shows a preference for vesper bats as its typical hosts. In this context, host-association and geographical separation may explain the evolutionary divergence of I. lanigeri Hornok from its closest relative occurring on Murina hilgendorfi Peters in East Asia, Japan, because no Myotis or Murina spp. have overlapping distribution between Vietnam and the main islands of Japan. On the other hand, supposing that (similarly to I. ariadnae) I. lanigeri Hornok probably occurs on other myotine bats and knowing that several Myotis species indigenous in Vietnam have a broad geographical range in southern and southeastern Asia, the new tick species most likely has a widespread distribution in this area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chiroptera; Myotis alticraniatus; Myotis laniger; new species; Pholeoixodes; Southeast Asia; taxonomy","","","","This study was supported by the Office for Supported Research Groups, Hungarian Research Network (HUN-REN), Hungary (Project No. 1500107) for SH and JK, the \u201CAgence nationale de la recherche\u201D (AAP RA-COVID-19, grant number ANR-21-CO12-0002) to AH and VTT, and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (Project No: KHCBT\u0110.02/22\u201324) to VTT.","Fuente, José De La, Flying ticks: Anciently evolved associations that constitute a risk of infectious disease spread, Parasites and Vectors, 8, 1, (2015); Hekimoğlu, Olcay, A survey of hard ticks associated with cave dwelling mammals in Turkey, Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases, 13, 6, (2022); Hornok, Sándor, Bat ticks revisited: Ixodes ariadnae sp. nov. and allopatric genotypes of I. vespertilionis in caves of Hungary, Parasites and Vectors, 7, 1, (2014); Hornok, Sándor, High degree of mitochondrial gene heterogeneity in the bat tick species Ixodes vespertilionis, I. ariadnae and I. simplex from Eurasia, Parasites and Vectors, 8, 1, (2015); Hornok, Sándor, Bird ticks in Hungary reflect western, southern, eastern flyway connections and two genetic lineages of Ixodes frontalis and Haemaphysalis concinna, Parasites and Vectors, 9, 1, (2016); Hornok, Sándor, Description of a new tick species, Ixodes collaris n. sp.

The nonlinear displacement model is established based on the axial deformation of V-beams with two fixed ends. Hence, the theoretical displacements of a particular V-shaped actuator (i.e. dimension as beam length of 750 μm; beam width of 6 μm; beam thickness of 30 μm; inclined angle of 2°) are compared with the simulation and experimental results. The evaluation shows that our calculation error compared with the simulation and experiment is less than 5% and 12.4%, respectively. This confirmed the advantages of the proposed formula according to the nonlinear displacement model. This work provides a theoretical model for predicting more precisely the displacement of a V-shaped actuator.

Among these, aquatic organisms, particularly non-target microalgae, bear substantial consequences from such contaminants. This study endeavored to evaluate the impact of the heavy metal lead (Pb) at concentrations of 2.5, 25, and 250 μg L−1 on the growth and lipid content of the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana in a 14-day toxicity test conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. The findings indicate that lower Pb concentrations (2.5 and 25 μg L−1) fostered algal proliferation, whereas exposure to 250 μg L−1 resulted in complete inhibition in two distinct endpoints. Additionally, no significant fluctuations in algal lipid content were discernible between exposure to 2.5 and 25 μg Pb L−1 and the control group. This study stands as a pioneering effort in unveiling the toxicity of Pb on C. meneghiniana, shedding light on the species’ susceptibility to this heavy metal and underscoring the necessity of incorporating this species into ongoing ecological risk assessments of Pb. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","algal density; ecological risk assessment; heavy metals; lipid content; stimulus effect","concentration (composition); diatom; environmental risk; heavy metal; lead; lipid; pollution exposure; risk assessment; toxicity","","","We acknowledge the support of time and facilities from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM, for this study.","Jurnal Online Mahasiswa, (2022); Ahmed, Minhaz Farid, Investigating the status of cadmium, chromium and lead in the drinking water supply chain to ensure drinking water quality in malaysia, Water (Switzerland), 12, 10, pp. 1-26, (2020); Ali, Hazrat, Environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology of hazardous heavy metals: Environmental persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation, Journal of Chemistry, 2019, (2019); Appiah-Opong, Regina, Heavy metals concentration and pollution index (HPI) in drinking water along the southwest coast of Ghana, Applied Water Science, 11, 3, (2021); Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (1992); Atıcı, Tahir, Ecological effects of some heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr) pollution of phytoplanktonic algae and zooplanktonic organisms in Sariyar Dam Reservoir in Turkey, African Journal of Biotechnology, 7, 12, pp. 1972-1977, (2008); Atıcı, Tahir, The accumulation of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr) and their state in phytoplanktonic algae and zooplanktonic organisms in Beysehir Lake and Mogan Lake, Turkey, African Journal of Biotechnology, 9, 4, pp. 475-487, (2010); Ayangbenro, Ayansina Segun, A new strategy for heavy metal polluted environments: A review of microbial biosorbents, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14, 1, (2017); Hama Aziz, Kosar Hikmat, Heavy metal pollution in the aquatic environment: efficient and low-cost removal approaches to eliminate their toxicity: a review, RSC Advances, 13, 26, pp. 17595-17610, (2023); Culturing Algae A Guide for Schools and Colleges, (1982)","","Carpathian Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences","","","","","","18424090; 1844489X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186918629"

The research focused on lycopene enrichment in watermelon juice by ultrafiltration (UF) with 1000 Da of molecular weight cut-off (MWCO). The selectivity of UF membrane for the constituents in watermelon juice was investigated from 2 to 8 bar by dead-end mode combined with stirring. The 1000 Da UF membrane showed a high potential to recover and separate lycopene from other components. However, membrane deposition and capillary occlusion could occur, affecting the overall efficiency of the enrichment process. To better understand kinetics, phenomena and efficiency, the study was evaluated in cross-flow mode with full recirculation of retentate. The enrichment efficiency was found to increase the concentration and purity of lycopene by several times. The concentration polarisation was used to describe permeate flux decline, while the Hermia model was developed to explain fouling mechanisms. The utilised models were highly compatible; additionally, pore blocking was thought to be the main mechanism of fouling in lycopene enrichment by 1000 Da UF.

This study aims to explore the prevalence and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of an infant’s life. Methods: A cross-sectional study utilized a self-administered maternal questionnaire to collect data on 1072 Vietnamese mothers who brought infants aged between 6 and 30 months to a community health centre (CHC) for routine vaccination. Data collection was conducted from March to May 2021 in two cities in Central and North Vietnam. In order to measure exclusive breastfeeding, we asked mothers to recall (yes / no), if the child had received breast milk, formula, colostrum milk powder, water, vitamin / medicine, fruit juice / honey, and complementary foods aged under six months. Results: In the first six months, 14.2% of mothers exclusively breastfed their infants. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between exclusive infant breastfeeding and the highest maternal education level (university or postgraduate) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10, 5.91); male infants (aOR 1.72; 95% CI 1.11, 2.68); duration of skin-to-skin contact greater than 90 min (aOR 7.69; 95% CI 1.95, 30.38); receiving first breastfeeding during skin-to-skin contact (aOR 2.31; 95% CI 1.30, 4.10); completely feeding infant directly at the breast (aOR 1.65; 95% CI 1.00, 2.71) and exclusive breastfeeding intention during pregnancy (aOR 2.48; 95% CI 1.53, 4.00). When compared with mothers who were prenatally exposed to infant formula advertising classified as “often”, the prevalence of exclusive infant breastfeeding was higher in mothers who classified their prenatal exposure to infant formula advertising as “sometimes” (aOR 2.15; 95% CI 1.13, 4.10), and “seldom” (aOR 2.58; 95% CI 1.25, 5.36). Conclusion: The prevalence of mothers who practiced exclusive infant breastfeeding during the first six months in Vietnam was low. Infants should receive early maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact greater than 90 min and complete first breastfeeding during skin-to-skin contact. Further, mothers should be protected against infant formula advertisements to maximise the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding during the child’s infancy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Associated factors; Breastfeeding; Breastfeeding intention; Early initiation of breastfeeding; Exclusive breastfeeding; Low–middle income country; Skin-to-skin contact; “dose-response” relationship","breast feeding; breast milk; child; cross-sectional study; developed country; female; human; infant; male; pregnancy; preschool child; prevalence; Breast Feeding; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Milk, Human; Pregnancy; Prevalence","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Faisal Khowaja, American University of the Caribbean, School of Medicine, Sint Maarten, for helping us to proofread this paper.

This study presents a discrete-time sliding mode control approach combined with the adaptive fuzzy algorithm (AFSMC) to deal with the unknown disturbance of the PAM-based actuator. The developed fuzzy logic system has parameter vectors of the component rules that are automatically updated by an adaptive law. Consequently, the developed fuzzy logic system can reasonably approximate the system disturbance.

However, the complexity level of tasks is unstructured, dynamic and complicated to perform. This paper develops a new method for evaluating the complexity level of tasks in the production process to support production managers to control their manufacturing systems in terms of flexibility, reliability to production planning and labor cost. Design/methodology/approach: The complexity level of tasks will be analyzed based on the structuralist concept. Using the structure of task, the factors that significantly affect the task complexity in an assembly line will be defined, and the complexity level of the task will be evaluated by measuring the number of task components. Using the proportional 2-tuples linguistic values, the difference between the complexity levels of tasks can be compared and described clearly. Findings: Based on the structure of the task, three contributory factors including input factors, process-operation factors and output factors that significantly affect the task complexity in an assembly line are identified in the present study. The complexity level of the task is quantified through analyzing the details of the three factors according to two criteria and six sub-criteria within the textile case study. Originality/value: The proposed approach provides a new insight about the factors that have an effect on the complexity of tasks in production and remedies some of limitations of previous methods. The combination of experts' experience and scientific knowledge will improve the accuracy in determining the complexity level of tasks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AHP method; Linguistic variables; Proportional 2-tuple linguistic representation model; Task complexity","","","","The authors would like to thank Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for the support of time and facilities for this study.","Afsar, Bilal, Transformational leadership and innovative work behavior: The role of motivation to learn, task complexity and innovation climate, European Journal of Innovation Management, 23, 3, pp. 402-428, (2020); Digital Transformation in Smart Manufacturing, (2018); Alkan, Bugra, Complexity in manufacturing systems and its measures: A literature review, European Journal of Industrial Engineering, 12, 1, pp. 116-150, (2018); Bag, Surajit, Modeling barriers of digital manufacturing in a circular economy for enhancing sustainability, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 71, 3, pp. 833-869, (2022); Bedny, Gregory Z., Complexity Evaluation of Computer-Based Tasks, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 28, 4, pp. 236-257, (2012); Bommer, Sharon Claxton, A theoretical framework for evaluating mental workload resources in human systems design for manufacturing operations, International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 63, pp. 7-17, (2018); Braarud, Per Øivind, Task complexity: What challenges the crew and how do they cope, pp. 233-251, (2011); Brown, Thomas M., Communication networks in task-performing groups: Effects of task complexity, time pressure, and interpersonal dominance, Small Group Research, 31, 2, pp. 131-157, (2000); Calinescu, Ani, Applying and assessing two methods for measuring complexity in manufacturing, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 49, 7, pp. 723-733, (1998); Chakraborty, Kaustov, Key decision-making areas of automotive engine remanufacturing: A case study, International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management, 39, 3, pp. 333-358, (2021)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17410401","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138273562"

In this study, DFT calculations were performed on four models with different twist angles. We chose angles of 21.8°, 17.9°, 13.2°, and 5.1° to estimate the dependence of the electronic and phononic properties on the twist angle. The results show that the band gap of bilayer SiC can be changed proportionally by changing the twist angle. However, there are only small variations in the band gaps, with an increment of 0.24 eV by changing the twist angle from 5.1° to 21.8°. At four considered twist angles, the band gaps decrease significantly when fixing the structure of each layer and pressing the separation distance down to 3.5 Å, 3.0 Å, 2.7 Å, and 2.5 Å. A noteworthy point is that the pressing also makes the band linearly smaller at a certain rate regardless of the twist angles. Meanwhile, the phonon bands are not affected by the value of the twist angle. The optical bands are between 900 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1 and the acoustic bands are between 0 cm−1 and 650 cm−1 at four twist angles. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Energy gap; Bi-layer; Bilayer systems; DFT calculation; Potential materials; Pressung; Property; Small variations; Twist angles; Twisted bilayers; Two-dimensional structures; Silicon carbide","","","We acknowledge Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for supporting this study.

Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) reduces CH<inf>4</inf> emission from paddy field, but the effect on rice yield remains unclear. Organic soil amendment increases grain yield but simultaneously increases CH<inf>4</inf> emission. Therefore, the combination of AWD and organic amendment may compensate for each other's shortcomings. The objective of this study was to assess whether AWD and organic amendment can increase rice yield while mitigating CH<inf>4</inf> emission. The experiments were conducted in a farmer's paddy field in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam, during five consecutive rice growing seasons in 2019–2021. Two water management practices, continuous flooding (CF) and AWD, with (+O) or without (−O) the application of a commercially available organic fertilizer were examined under normal cultivation conditions. Compared with CF, AWD significantly reduced CH<inf>4</inf> emission by 34 %, increased nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) by 46 %, and increased grain yield by 4.4 %. The +O treatment significantly increased the yield by 3.7 % relative to −O. Relative to CF−O by season, AWD+O significantly increased the yield. The integrated global warming potential of CH<inf>4</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O emissions was decreased by 33 % and irrigation water use was reduced by 33 % in AWD plots relative to that in CF plots. These results indicate that AWD by itself has the potential to increase rice yield as well as reduce CH<inf>4</inf> emission, and the combination of AWD with organic amendment would ensure yield increase. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas; Organic fertilizer; Water management","climate change; cultivation; fertilizer application; flooding; global warming; irrigation system; methane; soil amendment; water management; wetting-drying cycle; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam","","","This study was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan through the International Research Project “Development of Comprehensive Rice Cultivation Technologies that Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Asia” (a research subject in MAFF’s Strategic Project-research Promotion Project “Development of greenhouse gas reduction technologies in the agricultural sector through international collaboration”), and it was also supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid by Hue University under the Core Research Program (Grant No. NCM.DHH.2020.14 ).

It is an essential resource for human society, including drinking water and irrigation. Forecasting discharge and water level are crucial in establishing plans to secure water sources and predict floods. Deep learning has recently emerged as a potential solution for forecasting discharge and water levels. However, it faces three challenges: training data shortage, noise existence, and underestimation tendency. This research offers a novel deep learning-based method addressing the abovementioned shortcomings. To overcome data scarcity and improve prediction accuracy, we leverage the strengths of the one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Ensemble learning technique. Specifically, 1D-CNN uses a kernel moving in one direction and executing the convolution operations to extract the correlations between the features. LSTM helps to capture temporal relationships inside the data, while ensemble learning exploits multiple learning models for better predictive performance. Besides, Singular-Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique is applied to decompose the input data into several components and eliminate noise-like ones while retaining essential parts. Besides, the attention mechanism is leveraged to assign higher weights for more essential features, further enhancing the accuracy. Finally, we utilize the Linear Exponential (LINEX) loss to prevent under- and overestimation. The experiments show that our proposal outperforms existing approaches regarding all metrics. Notably, our method improves the Nash–Sutcliffe model Efficiency coefficient (NSE) (the most critical metric) by up to 40% and 34% concerning one-step-ahead and multistep-ahead, respectively, compared to existing approaches. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention; CNN; Discharge and water level prediction; Ensemble learning; LSTM; SSA","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Flow of water; Forecasting; Learning systems; Potable water; Runoff; Spectrum analysis; Water levels; Attention; Data enhancement; Discharge and water level prediction; Ensemble learning; Ensemble models; Singular spectrum analysis; Surface runoffs; Training data; Water flows; Water level prediction; Long short-term memory","","","The research is funded by Vietnam’s National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 102.01-2020.23 , and partly funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under grant number T2022-PC-044 .","Masrur Ahmed, Abul Abrar, New double decomposition deep learning methods for river water level forecasting, Science of the Total Environment, 831, (2022); Journal of Babylon University, (2018); Bahdanau, Dzmitry, Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, (2015); Barzegar, Rahim, Coupling a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model with a Boundary Corrected Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform for multiscale Lake water level forecasting, Journal of Hydrology, 598, (2021); Chang, Yen Chang, LINEX loss functions with applications to determining the optimum process parameters, Quality and Quantity, 41, 2, pp. 291-301, (2007); Data Science and Data Analytics Opportunities and Challenges, (2021); Chen, Chen, A short-term flood prediction based on spatial deep learning network: A case study for Xi County, China, Journal of Hydrology, 607, (2022); Choi, Changhyun, Development of water level prediction models using machine learning in wetlands: A case study of Upo wetland in South Korea, Water (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2020); Collischonn, W., Forecasting River Uruguay flow using rainfall forecasts from a regional weather-prediction model, Journal of Hydrology, 305, 1-4, pp. 87-98, (2005); El-Diasty, Mohammed, Hybrid harmonic analysis and wavelet network model for sea water level prediction, Applied Ocean Research, 70, pp. 14-21, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09521976","","EAAIE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171474951"

Several different methods based on different principles have been developed to trace the nitroaromatic compound such as the 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) compound. Recently, explosive detecting sensors based on organic conjugated fluorescent materials have been one of the most emerging subjects due to their reliable detection methods as well as portable lightweight instruments. This work uses two novel red fluorescent conjugated polymers, poly(PHP-alt-3HT) and poly(PHP-r-3HT-r-BTz), based on N-peryleneyl phenoxazine (PHP) and 3-hexyl thiophene (3HT), and benzotriazole (BTz) was successfully synthesized via an aerobic condition by direct arylation polycondensation. The red-fluorescent chemosensor based on novel conjugated polymers performed a high sensitivity for TNT detection with fast response time and good selectivity compared to common interferences.

However, an effective design of CGFEs with desired properties from a huge compositional space remains an enormous challenge. In this study, we present an efficient design strategy for CGFEs through a combination of high-throughput phase-field simulation and machine learning (ML) algorithm. Systematic phase-field simulations are first performed to establish a dataset of electromechanical properties for various CGFEs, which are characterized by three degrees of freedom, including compositions of two end materials and gradient index. A ML-assisted optimization process is then conducted on this dataset to yield optimal electromechanical properties, which are further analyzed by phase-field simulations. The ML-guided simulations lead us to discover that the large optimal electromechanical responses can be achieved in CGFEs with average composition near the morphotropic phase boundary yet large compositional gradient. These CGFEs accommodate a coexistence of tetragonal, orthorhombic, and cubic phases in their domain structures, which flatten the energy barrier landscape and facilitate the rotation of polarization under mechanical field. Our proposed highly efficient design strategy can be readily adapted to identify CGFEs possessing other principal elements and properties, which will accelerate the discovery of new high-performance CGFE materials. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compositionally graded ferroelectric; Electromechanical property; High-throughput simulations; Machine learning; Phase-field model","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Ferroelectric materials; Compositionally graded ferroelectric; Electromechanical property; Electromechanical response; Field machines; High-throughput; High-throughput simulation; Machine-learning; Phase field models; Phase-field simulation; Property; Machine learning","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-TD-006.","Fu, Huaxiang, Polarization rotation mechanism for ultrahigh electromechanical response in single-crystal piezoelectrics, Nature, 403, 6767, pp. 281-283, (2000); Zhang, Shujun, Advantages and challenges of relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric crystals for electroacoustic transducers - A review, Progress in Materials Science, 68, pp. 1-66, (2015); Saito, Yasuyoshi, Lead-free piezoceramics, Nature, 432, 7013, pp. 84-87, (2004); Liu, Wenfeng, Large piezoelectric effect in Pb-free ceramics, Physical Review Letters, 103, 25, (2009); Acosta, Matias, BaTiO3-based piezoelectrics: Fundamentals, current status, and perspectives, Applied Physics Reviews, 4, 4, (2017); Gao, Xiaoyi, The mechanism for the enhanced piezoelectricity in multi-elements doped (K,Na)NbO3 ceramics, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Nahas, Yousra, Microscopic origins of the large piezoelectricity of leadfree (Ba,Ca)(Zr,Ti)O3, Nature Communications, 8, (2017); Wu, Jiagang, Potassium-sodium niobate lead-free piezoelectric materials: Past, present, and future of phase boundaries, Chemical Reviews, 115, 7, pp. 2559-2595, (2015); Li, Jingfeng, (K, Na) NbO3-based lead-free piezoceramics: Fundamental aspects, processing technologies, and remaining challenges, Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 96, 12, pp. 3677-3696, (2013); Ahart, Muhtar, Origin of morphotropic phase boundaries in ferroelectrics, Nature, 451, 7178, pp. 545-548, (2008)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00255408","","MRBUA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164222990"

We examined the impact of long emptying intervals (4.0-23 years) on the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal efficiency of 15 blackwater septic tanks and the CH<inf>4</inf> emission rates of 23 blackwater septic tanks in Hanoi. The average BOD removal efficiency was 37% (−2-65%), and the average CH<inf>4</inf> emission rate was 10.9 (2.2-26.8) g/(cap·d). The emptying intervals were strongly negatively correlated with BOD removal efficiency (R = −0.676, p = 0.006) and positively correlated with CH<inf>4</inf> emission rates (R = 0.614, p = 0.001). CH<inf>4</inf> emission rates were positively correlated with sludge depth (R = 0.596, p = 0.002), but against expectation, negatively correlated with BOD removal efficiency (R = −0.219, p = 0.451). These results suggest that shortening the emptying interval improves the BOD removal efficiency and reduces the CH<inf>4</inf> emission rate. Moreover, the CH<inf>4</inf> emission estimation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is a positive conversion of BOD removal, might be inaccurate for septic tanks with long emptying intervals. Our findings suggest that emptying intervals, sludge depth, and per-capita emission factors reflecting long emptying intervals are potential parameters for accurately estimating CH<inf>4</inf> emissions from septic tanks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","climate change mitigation; greenhouse gas; long emptying intervals; methane emission; on-site sanitation; pollutant removal; septic tanks","Biochemical oxygen demand; Climate change; Developing countries; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Methane; Septic tanks; Blackwater; CH 4; Climate change mitigation; Emissions rates; Greenhouses gas; Long emptying interval; Methane emissions; On-site sanitations; Pollutants removal; Removal efficiencies; Greenhouse gases; methane; biochemical oxygen demand; biogenic emission; emission; greenhouse gas; pollutant removal; waste disposal; Article; chemical oxygen demand; climate change; climate change mitigation; controlled study; data analysis; gas chromatography; greenhouse gas emission; information processing; methane emission; middle income country; sanitation; seasonal variation; sewage; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gases; Sewage","","methane, 74-82-8; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Sewage","This study was funded by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (no. 16H02748) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1212310).

Many studies have shown that MRE properties are influenced by particle size, particle volume fraction, and matrix material type. The particle-magnetic dipole theory has demonstrated that the angle of the particle chains significantly affects the properties. This study investigated the effects of the alignment angle of the particle chains on the properties of MREs. The inclination angle is a parameter associated with the external magnetic flux density. MRE samples fabricated under a magnetic field with different tilt angles were prepared for the shear tests. The primary properties of MRE, such as viscoelasticity, magnetic-induced properties, and hysteresis, were comprehensively investigated in the samples. The equivalent stiffness and loss of energy changed significantly in the tilted angle domain. The force–displacement loops also showed a clear difference among the samples when the experiments were performed at the same amplitude, frequency, and magnetic flux density. The experimental results show that the magnetic and hysteretic properties strongly depend on the initial tilt angle of the chain. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hysteresis; Magnetic-field induced property; Magnetorheological elastomer; Particle-chain tilt angle; Viscoelasticity","Elastomers; Magnetic fields; Magnetic flux; Particle size; Plastics; Stiffness; Viscoelasticity; Field-induced; Induced properties; Magnetic-field; Magnetic-field induced property; Magnetorheological elastomers; Particle chain; Particle-chain tilt angle; Property; Tilt angle; Tilted angle; Hysteresis","","","This research is funded by University of Technology and Education—The University of Danang under project number T2022-06-02 and by Kanazawa University.","Hoang, Nga, A dynamic absorber with a soft magnetorheological elastomer for powertrain vibration suppression, Smart Materials and Structures, 18, 7, (2009); Sun, Shuaishuai, Development of a nonlinear adaptive absorber based on magnetorheological elastomer, Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 29, 2, pp. 194-204, (2018); Bian, Yushu, Vibration Reduction for a Flexible Arm Using Magnetorheological Elastomer Vibration Absorber, Shock and Vibration, 2018, (2018); Nguyen, Xuan Bao, Modeling and semi-active fuzzy control of magnetorheological elastomer-based isolator for seismic response reduction, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 101, pp. 449-466, (2018); Bao, Nguyen Xuan, Fuzzy semi-active control of multi-degree-of-freedom structure using magnetorheological elastomers, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Pressure Vessels and Piping Division (Publication) PVP, 8, (2017); Gu, Xiaoyu, Experimental realisation of the real-time controlled smart magnetorheological elastomer seismic isolation system with shake table, Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 27, 1, (2020); Li, Rui, Study on a new self-sensing magnetorheological elastomer bearing, AIP Advances, 8, 6, (2018); Bica, Ioan, Magnetorheological hybrid elastomers based on silicone rubber and magnetorheological suspensions with graphene nanoparticles: Effects of the magnetic field on the relative dielectric permittivity and electric conductivity, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 20, 17, (2019); Nguyen, Xuan Bao, A nonlinear magnetorheological elastomer model based on fractional viscoelasticity, magnetic dipole interactions, and adaptive smooth Coulomb friction, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 141, (2020); Norouzi, Mahmood, A new approach for modeling of magnetorheological elastomers, Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 27, 8, pp. 1121-1135, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03048853","","JMMMD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166465672"

This study specifically focuses on evaluating the influence of fly-ash additives on the wear resistance of machine components when incorporated into lubricant oil. The experiments were conducted following ASTM standard operating conditions, utilizing the four-ball wear test to measure the scratch width and weight loss of balls using different lubricant oil formulations, including 0, 0.1%, 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1% additive. The findings demonstrate that the inclusion of 0.5% fly ash additive in the lubricant oil results in a significant reduction in both scratch width and weight loss of the balls. However, it should be noted that higher additive ratios may lead to increased scratch width and weight loss due to the agglomeration of the fly ash particles on the sliding surfaces. To achieve optimal effectiveness in reducing friction and wear, it is recommended to carefully control the content of fly ash within an appropriate range. Furthermore, this study highlights the width of scratches on balls as a reliable indicator for assessing the anti-wear properties of oils. The insights gained from this research offer valuable guidance to manufacturers in the selection of suitable anti-wear oils for specific applications. Further investigations could explore the impact of different lubricants and additive ratios to identify the most appropriate lubrication parameters. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the effects of fly ash additives on the performance of lubricant oil and provides practical guidance for optimizing lubrication strategies in diverse industrial contexts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fly ash additive; lubricant; scratch diameter; scratch width; wear resistance","","","","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENT Funding: This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-026.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgments: The School of Mechanical Engineering and Hanoi University of Science and Technology are gratefully acknowledged for providing support and conditions to carry out this research.

PAMs, when configured antagonistically, offer several advantages in creating human-like actuators. However, their inherent nonlinearity and uncertainty pose challenges for achieving precise control, especially in rehabilitation applications where control quality is crucial for safety and efficacy. To address these challenges, we propose an RBF-SMC approach that leverages the nonlinear elimination capability of SMC and the adaptive learning ability of RBFNN. The integration of these two techniques aims to develop a robust controller capable of effectively dealing with the inherent disadvantages of PAM systems under various operating conditions. The suggested RBF-SMC approach is theoretically verified using the Lyapunov stability theory, providing a solid foundation for its effectiveness. To validate its performance, extensive multi-scenario experiments were conducted, serving as a significant contribution of this research. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed controller compared to conventional controllers in terms of convergence time, robustness, and stability. This research offers a significant contribution to the field of PAM system control, particularly in the context of rehabilitation. The developed RBF-SMC approach provides an efficient and reliable solution to overcome the challenges posed by PAMs’ nonlinearity and uncertainty, enhancing control quality and ensuring the safety and efficacy of these systems in practical applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive control; Pneumatic artificial muscle; Radial basis function neural network; Sliding mode control","Adaptive control systems; Controllers; Muscle; Pneumatic drives; Pneumatics; Quality control; Radial basis function networks; Adaptive Control; Control approach; Control quality; Muscle system; Performance; Pneumatic artificial muscle; Radial basis function neural networks (RBF); Radial basis neural networks; Sliding-mode control; Uncertainty; Sliding mode control","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-002.","Sliding Modes in Control and Optimization, (1992); Afifa, Roohma, Adaptive Backstepping Integral Sliding Mode Control of a MIMO Separately Excited DC Motor, Robotics, 12, 4, (2023); Saleem, Omer, Fuzzy-Immune-Regulated Adaptive Degree-of-Stability LQR for a Self-Balancing Robotic Mechanism: Design and HIL Realization, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 8, 8, pp. 4577-4584, (2023); Ahmad, Sohail, Chattering Free Sliding Mode Control and State Dependent Kalman Filter Design for Underground Gasification Energy Conversion Process, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 4, (2023); Lilly, John H., A two-input sliding-mode controller for a planar arm actuated by four pneumatic muscle groups, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 12, 3, pp. 349-359, (2004); Vo, Cong Phat, A Novel Adaptive Gain Integral Terminal Sliding Mode Control Scheme of a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle System with Time-Delay Estimation, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 141133-141143, (2019); Chiang, Chiajui, Neural network fuzzy sliding mode control of pneumatic muscle actuators, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 65, pp. 68-86, (2017); Applied Nonlinear Control, (1991); Kachroo, Pushkin, Chattering reduction and error convergence in the sliding-mode control of a class of nonlinear systems, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 41, 7, pp. 1063-1068, (1996); Fridman, Leonid M., An averaging approach to chattering, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 46, 8, pp. 1260-1265, (2001)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","25233971","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168650680"

Data were obtained through direct interviews with 325 farmers in the Phu Vang, Phong Dien and Huong Thuy Districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The results revealed the ineffectiveness in demographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, number of laborers, OF experience, percentage of organic rice area, non-farm jobs and involvement in community-based organizations to predict farmer intentions to expand ORF. The findings highlighted the more significant influence of factors related to economic outcomes, farmer awareness of OF, and their confidence in the market outlook.

This study aims to fill these gaps by employing the Livelihood Subjective Resilience (LSR) framework to measure household resilience and conducting a comprehensive analysis of the intersectionality across these dimensions. The research focuses on a sample of 188 ethnic minority households (94 Tà Ôi and 94 Pa Cô) in upland regions of Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. Findings reveal significant variations in resilience among these groups, particularly with lower LSR scores observed among women and the poor. Notably, poor women from Pa Cô ethnic households exhibit the most fragile resilience compared to other segments of society. This disparity is influenced by multifaceted ingredients including limited financial resources, restricted asset portfolios, patriarchal social norms, and psychological issues. The study thus emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to enhance the roles and rights of marginalized groups, particularly in terms of equitable access to resources like land tenure. Addressing poverty and inequality should be the most priority for achieving economic rural development, disaster preparedness, and resilience capacity building. The study highlights the importance of tailored training programs and non-refundable livelihood support to improve overall well-being and uplift disadvantaged groups.

With the dramatic growth of deep learning in recent years, many models have achieved a high accuracy for this task. However, most existing deep-learning methods for lane detection face two main problems. First, most early studies usually follow a segmentation approach, which requires much post-processing to extract the necessary geometric information about the lane lines. Second, many models fail to reach real-time speed due to the high complexity of model architecture. To offer a solution to these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network that requires only two small arrays for minimum post-processing, instead of segmentation maps for the task of lane detection. This proposed network utilizes a simple lane representation format for its output. The proposed model can achieve 93.53% accuracy on the TuSimple dataset. A hardware accelerator is proposed and implemented on the Virtex-7 VC707 FPGA platform to optimize processing time and power consumption. Several techniques, including data quantization to reduce data width down to 8-bit, exploring various loop-unrolling strategies for different convolution layers, and pipelined computation across layers, are optimized in the proposed hardware accelerator architecture. This implementation can process at 640 FPS while consuming only 10.309 W, equating to a computation throughput of 345.6 GOPS and energy efficiency of 33.52 GOPS/W. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","convolutional neural network; FPGA; hardware architecture; lane detection; QuantLaneNet","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Network architecture; Autonomous Vehicles; Convolutional neural network; Geometric information; Hardware architecture; High-accuracy; Lane detection; Learning methods; Post-processing; Quantlanenet; Real- time; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DS2023-26-02.","Chiu, Kuoyu, Lane detection using color-based segmentation, IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings, 2005, pp. 706-711, (2005); He, Yinghua, Color-based road detection in urban traffic scenes, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 5, 4, pp. 309-318, (2004); Chen, Zhongho, Resource-efficient FPGA architecture and implementation of hough transform, IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, 20, 8, pp. 1419-1428, (2012); Karabernou, Si Mahmoud, Real-time FPGA implementation of Hough Transform using gradient and CORDIC algorithm, Image and Vision Computing, 23, 11, pp. 1009-1017, (2005); Wen, Tuopu, Bridging the Gap of Lane Detection Performance between Different Datasets: Unified Viewpoint Transformation, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 22, 10, pp. 6198-6207, (2021); Li, Jun, Deep Neural Network for Structural Prediction and Lane Detection in Traffic Scene, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 28, 3, pp. 690-703, (2017); Kim, Jihun, Robust lane detection based on convolutional neural network and random sample consensus, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8834, pp. 454-461, (2014); Hoang, Toanminh, Deep retinanet-based detection and classification of road markings by visible light camera sensors, Sensors, 19, 2, (2019); Li, Shoubiao, Efficient Multi-Lane Detection Based on Large-Kernel Convolution and Location, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 58125-58135, (2023); Li, Junfeng, Lane image detection based on convolution neural network multi-task learning, Electronics (Switzerland), 10, 19, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","14248220","","","37571445","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167867896"

The obtained magnetic fields (B-fields) from the polarized emission of the early-stage and massive filament tend to be perpendicular to its spine. We produce a map of B-field strengths for the center region of the filament. The strengths vary in the range of 100-600 μG and are strongest along the filament's spine. The central region is sub-Alfvénic and mostly subcritical, meaning that B-fields dominate over turbulence and are strong enough to resist gravitational collapse. The alignment and properties of dust grains in the filament are studied using radiative torque (RAT) theory. We find the decrease of polarization degree P with emission intensity I, i.e., depolarization effect, of the form P ∝ I −α  with α ∼ 0.8-0.9, implying a significant loss of grain alignment in the filament's spine. The depolarization can be explained by the decrease in RAT alignment efficiency toward the denser regions with weaker radiation field, which cannot be explained by B-field tangling. We study the effect of the enhanced magnetic relaxation by embedded iron inclusions on RAT alignment and find that the high polarization fraction P ∼ 20%-30% in the outer layer of the filament is potential evidence for the magnetically enhanced RAT alignment mechanism. This is the first time this effect is evaluated in a filament. Based on the polarization fraction and RAT alignment theory, we also find evidence for grain growth in the filament. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Funding text 1: We are grateful to the anonymous reviewer for her/his detailed comments that helped improve the clarity of the paper.

A Z-scheme photocatalyst comprising a Re(i) complex and a polymeric semiconductor (bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>)) converted CO<inf>2</inf> to CO even under the irradiation of low-intensity visible light. The electronic interaction between Re(i) and g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> units and the injection of electrons from g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> to the Re(i) complex improved the photocatalytic efficiency. The lower recombination of electron-hole pairs and the prolonged emission decay (the average emission lifetime τ = 5.8 ms) contributed to the increased overall efficiency of the hybrid system. The maximum turnover number (TON) of CO formation reached 28.56 after 240 min with a high CO selectivity (99.8%). Compared to the homogeneous photocatalyst Re(i), the TON of CO formation was increased by 5.6 times and CO selectivity was higher. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of the substrate-supported Re complex (Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>) on the CO<inf>2</inf> Reduction Reaction (CO2RR) activity. The results indicate that Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> presents a lower energy barrier for *CO<inf>2</inf> to *COOH conversion, promoting *COOH formation more effectively than pure g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>. Moreover, the energy barrier for *CO desorption is lower in Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> than in Re(bpy-COOH), suggesting a reduction in the strong binding of adsorbed CO intermediates, highlighting the intermediate ensemble effect at the active site. The improved CO2RR activity in Re(bpy-COOH)/g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> can be attributed to the balance between the enhancement of reaction activity and the binding energy of intermediates at the active site. The study of photocatalytic CO<inf>2</inf> reduction (PCO2R) under low-intensity-visible-light irradiation and DFT investigation has reveal an insight into the CO2RR activity for CO<inf>2</inf> reduction under various irradiation conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Binding energy; Carbon nitride; Density functional theory; Energy barriers; Energy policy; Global warming; Heterojunctions; Hybrid systems; Irradiation; Photocatalytic activity; Reaction intermediates; Rhenium compounds; CO 2 reduction; CO formation; CO selectivity; Low-intensity; Photo-catalytic; Re complex; Reaction activity; Reduction reaction; Turnover number; Visible-light-driven; Carbon dioxide","","","The authors appreciate the financial support from Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under Grant Number CSCL19.03/23-24.

However, suboptimal breastfeeding practices have been reported in many countries. This study aims to describe patterns of breastfeeding from birth to 24 months in Vietnam and examine factors associated with the maintenance of breastfeeding at 12 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 573 mothers whose infants aged from 12 to 24 months in a multi-centre cross-sectional study were recruited. RESULTS: The prevalence of initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour post-partum was 52.9%, between 1 to 24 hours was 21.9%, after the 24 hours was 25.2% and none not initiated by the 7th day after birth. The prevalence of delayed initiation of breastfeeding was significantly higher in caesarean section than in vaginal births (p=0.0001). Prevalence of infants ever breastfed was 100%; exclusively breastfed at 6 months was 19.7%, continued breastfeeding at 12 months was 92.5%, and continued breastfeeding at 20-24 months was 43.5%. There were 16.4% of mothers had breastfeeding problems. Correctly describing the recommended duration of exclusive breastfeeding and not using a bottle to give expressed milk to the infants were factors associated with the higher prevalence of breastfeeding maintenance for 12 months. CONCLUSION: Early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding prevalence at 6 months in our study earn rating of “good” and “fair” respectively according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. Improving mothers’ knowledge of exclusive breastfeeding recommendations and educating about breast milk expression may improve the prevalence of breastfeeding maintenance at 12 months. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","12 months; associated factors; breastfeeding; breastfeeding problem; early initiation breastfeeding","","","","This research is funded by Funds for Science and Technology Development of the University of Danang under project number B2020-DN01-28.

Fly-ash additives are added to lubricating oils to improve oxidation resistance and prevent deposit formation, which may reduce viscosity loss at high temperatures. This study aimed to investigate the impact of fly-ash additives and temperature on the viscosity of oils B, C, and A. The experimental methodology involved comparing the viscosity of these oils with and without the addition of a 0.5% fly-ash additive. Viscosity measurements were taken at different temperatures. The results showed significant changes in viscosity after incorporating the fly-ash additive. At 25 °C, oils B, C, and A exhibited viscosity increases of 6.2%, 8.1%, and 13.8%, respectively, compared to the samples without the additive. Similarly, at 75 °C, the viscosity increments were 10.2%, 11.5%, and 22.8% for oils B, C, and A, respectively. At 85 °C, the corresponding increments were 11.1%, 16.6%, and 32.8%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of fly-ash additives in reducing the impact of temperature on oil viscosity, with oil A demonstrating the highest efficacy. By adjusting the viscosity of the oil at different temperatures, the fly-ash additives contribute to maintaining stable lubricating performance. Understanding the influence of fly-ash additives and temperature on oil viscosity is crucial for optimizing the performance of lubricants across various temperature conditions. Additionally, this knowledge assists in selecting the appropriate additive ratios for specific applications, thereby ensuring optimal lubricant performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fly-ash additive; shear stress; temperature; viscosity","","","","Funding text 1: The School of Mechanical Engineering and Hanoi University of Science and Technology are gratefully acknowledged for providing support and conditions to carry out this research.

As one of the most attractive machine learning algorithms, random forest is widely used in many fields. However, the random forest algorithm is computational and resource intensive, especially for large datasets. Therefore, it is not widely used for IoT applications. This paper proposes a flexible and efficient FPGA-based architecture for random forest targeting edge computing platforms where resources and computing power are limited. The architecture allows the number of decision trees in the random forest to be reconfigured for a particular platform. To improve the system's performance based on this architecture, we design a pipeline decision tree processor to compute decision trees that are the main components of the random forest algorithm. Although we target and build our experiments with FPGA-based edge computing platforms, the Kria KV260 and PYNQ-Z2, our system achieves throughput speed-ups by up to 28.37× and 13.11× when compared to an Intel core i7 processor, respectively. Furthermore, our system in the two edge computing platforms is energy-efficiency also when it consumes 3.721 μJPS (μ-joule per sample) and 3.328 μJPS for the PYNQ-Z2 and Kria KV260 platforms, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FPGA-based architecture; IoTs edge computing; Random forest","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number NCM2021-20-02 .

The total OPFRs (ƩOPFRs) concentrations in indoor air and dust samples were 42.3–358 ng m−3 (median 101 ng m−3) and 1290–17,500 ng g−1 (median 7580 ng g−1), respectively. The profile of OPFRs in both indoor air and dust indicated that tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) was the most dominant compound with a median concentration of 75.3 ng m−3 and 3620 ng g−1, contributing 75.2% and 46.1% to ƩOPFRs concentrations in indoor air and dust, respectively, followed by tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), with a median concentration of 16.3 ng m−3 and 2500 ng g−1, contributing 14.1% and 33.6% to ƩOPFRs concentrations in indoor air and dust, respectively. The levels of OPFRs in the indoor air samples and corresponding indoor dust samples showed a strong positive correlation.

This knowledge gap presents challenges for identifying at-risk individuals and communities and could impede effective public policy and resource allocation for adaptation efforts. To address this issue, this study employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index referencing IPCC definitions (LVI-IPCC) framework to examine livelihood vulnerability and its determinants among 455 small-scale households in the coastal areas of Phu Vang district, Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. The LVI-IPCC calculation utilized a database of 11 major and 33 sub-indicators collected through a household survey conducted in 2021. The findings revealed that these households exhibit moderate vulnerability to natural disasters and climate shocks, as reflected by their high sensitivity index scores. Additionally, the study identified a persistent cycle of poverty and livelihood vulnerability among coastal communities, wherein poverty and reliance on nature-based income serve as the root cause of the exposure and a gateway to this loop. This study strongly advocates for a pro-poor approach that places poverty alleviation at the forefront of community development planning and climate change agendas. Under this approach, developing value chain models in agriculture and aquaculture and diversifying livelihoods through activities such as community-based tourism is highly recommended. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate change; coastal areas; livelihood vulnerability; poverty; Vietnam","","","","The authors would like to express their gratitude for the support received from Project VIE/433 - Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience in Thua Thien Hue Province, Vietnam.

The effect of annealing tem-perature, quenching & tempering, and nitriding were determined. The microstructure and properties of the samples were investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction, electron probe micro-analysis, X-ray diffraction, roughness measurement, and a hardness tester. The results show that the as-built AISI H13 steel sample had a roughness on the surface and pores inside. The microstructure consisted of martensite and retained austenite. The average hardness was 460 HV, and the porosity was 0.086 %. The annealing process helped homogenize the microstructure, increase the density, and reduce the porosity and hardness of the LPBF-manufactured sample. The quenching process helped increase the hardness of the steel to the maximum of 787 HV, then the tempering process reduced the hardness to 572 HV. Heat treatment and nitriding processes tended to increase the martensite block size, reduce the retained austenitic content, and precipitate the V-Mo-rich carbide in the LPBF-manu-factured AISI H13 steel. After nitriding was conducted, the nitriding case depth was 87 μm, and the surface hardness increased up to higher than 1020 HV due to the formation of CrN and Fe3-4N. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AISI H13 steel; gas nitriding; heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)","","","","Acknowledgements: This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2021-SAHEP-015.","Mazur, Maciej, SLM additive manufacture of H13 tool steel with conformal cooling and structural lattices, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 22, 3, pp. 504-518, (2016); Åsberg, Mikael, Influence of post treatment on microstructure, porosity and mechanical properties of additive manufactured H13 tool steel, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 742, pp. 584-589, (2019); Manfredi, Diego, Laser powder bed fusion of aluminum alloys, Acta Metallurgica Slovaca, 23, 3, pp. 276-282, (2017); Bidulský, Róbert, Coated metal powders for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) processing: A review, Metals, 11, 11, (2021); Petroušek, Patrik, Influence of cryorolling on properties of L-PBF 316l stainless steel tested at 298K and 77K, Acta Metallurgica Slovaca, 25, 4, pp. 283-290, (2019); State of the Art for Additive Manufacturing of Metals, (2017); 3D Printing Handbook Technologies Design and Applications, (2017); Fundamentals of Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Metals, (2021); 29th Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, (2018); AlMangour, Bandar, Selective laser melting of TiB2/H13 steel nanocomposites: Influence of hot isostatic pressing post-treatment, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 244, pp. 344-353, (2017)","","Technical University of Kosice","","","","","","13381156; 13351532","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163661424"

Nevertheless, data on sedimentary deposition of AAL/Os has remained scarce, particularly for regions beyond the North America. In the present study, we elucidated spatial distribution of fifteen AAL/Os and five AAO transformation products (AAOTPs) in seventy-seven sediments from the Dong Nai River System (DNRS), Vietnam. Total concentrations of AAL/Os (∑AAL/Os) ranged from 0.377 to 51.4 ng/g (median: 5.01 ng/g). 1,3-Diphenylguanidine and 4,4′-bis(1,1-dimethylbenzyl) diphenylamine were the two most prevalent congeners, both with detection frequencies >80%. Additionally, AAOTPs were quantifiable in 79% of the DNRS sediments with a median ∑AAOTPs at 2.19 ng/g, dominated by N, N′-diphenylbenzidine and 2-nitrodiphenylamine. Higher sediment-associated levels of AAL/Os and AAOTPs were spotted in downstream and the primary tributary of the DNRS compared to the upstream, implying their cumulative sedimentation towards the estuarine region. The distribution patterns of AAL/Os and AAOTPs across individual transects also demonstrated the influence of human activities (e.g., urbanization and agriculture), hydrodynamics, and decontamination by mangrove reserves. Meanwhile, characteristics of sediments, i.e., total organic carbon (TOC) content and grain sizes, exhibited significant correlations with the burdens of these compounds, indicating their preferential partitioning into the fine and TOC-rich matter. This research sheds light on environmental behavior of AAL/Os and AAOTPs beneath Asian aquatic system, and highlights the need for further evaluation of their impacts on the wildlife and public health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amino accelerators and antioxidants; Driving factors; Spatial distribution; The Dong Nai River System; Transformation products","amino accelerator; antioxidant; benzene; chemical agent; unclassified drug; fluvial deposit; mangrove; partitioning; sediment-water interface; sedimentation; spatial distribution; total organic carbon; transformation; tributary; urbanization; agriculture; analysis of variance; aquatic environment; Article; biosphere; controlled study; correlation analysis; decontamination; environmental impact; human activities; hydrodynamics; irradiation; nonhuman; particle size; public health; river; sediment; spatial analysis; turbidity; Viet Nam; wildlife; China; environmental monitoring; human; water pollutant; Dong Nai River; North America; Agriculture; Antioxidants; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Rivers; Vietnam; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","benzene, 71-43-2; Antioxidants; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42230505, 42107391, 4210070236), a KAKENHI grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( JSPS ) (JP 17H02980), and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (NVCC21.01/22–23).","Babut, Marc, Where has the pollution gone?

In such applications, three single-phase transformers are commonly employed as the AC-link to simplify manufacturing and reduce costs. These transformers’ leakage inductance can be utilized instead of the external leakage inductance to achieve high power density. However, the assumption of uniformity in these inductances is not always accurate as they can vary significantly during fabrication. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of transformer leakage inductance variation, which can deviate by up to 24% from the desired value. The effects of this variation are investigated from different perspectives, including power transfer, soft-switching range, root-mean-square (RMS) current, and the temperature rise of the transformer winding. Although the power transfer and total copper loss of transformers are changed insignificantly even under highly mismatched leakage inductance, the currents and thermal distribution among phases are considerably impacted.

The simulation was performed with contact angle condition to fit the Taylor cone shape by experiments. Experimental data are provided to verify and validate the numerical method, followed by additional analyses on the effects of electrical conductivity, surface tension, flow rate, and fluid viscosity on the electrospray characteristics, including spray current and jet diameter. Numerical results by simulations are in reasonable agreement with experiments and consistent with the literature. Analyses on different contact angles suggest potentially major impacts of this factor on the cone-jet mode in high voltage and low flow rate circumstances. Furthermore, the influence of corona discharge on electrospray is also investigated by both electrospray-corona simulation and experiment using a high-speed camera, yielding a significant improvement in the numerical prediction for Taylor cone formation. Numerical results indicate that liquid wetting on capillary nozzles would be a vital factor for the Taylor cone formation in numerical electrospray-corona discharge studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Atomization; Contact angle; Electric corona; Electrohydrodynamics; High speed cameras; Numerical methods; Condition; Cone shape; Cone-jet mode; Corona discharges; Discharge effects; Electrical conductivity; Electrohydrodynamic atomization; Electrosprays; Numerical results; Taylor cone; Wetting","","","We acknowledge the support of time and facilities from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for this study.

Although the impact of these policies is tremendous in increasing solar energy capacity, the latest policy for solar power expired at the end of 2020. To support the Vietnam government in promulgating the next incentive policy, this paper proposes a feasibility assessment model for rooftop solar policies, which enables the viability evaluation of policies from the perspective of both utility/entity and customer. By utilizing the policy options customized by users, the model generates a significant amount of technical and financial output to appreciate the impacts of potential policies under different scenarios. Five policy options have been simulated and evaluated using the proposed model. The output data shows the importance of the FIT rate in establishing the feasibility of a rooftop solar project, where the higher the FIT rate, the lower the feasibility for the utility, and vice versa. By using the output data from the proposed model, policymakers can have a better view of the impacts of different policies under different scenarios, which results in the development and implementation of more impactful policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assessment model; Feed in Tariff; Net Metering; Rooftop solar policy","Assessment models; Case-studies; Feasibility assessment; Feed-in tariff; Incentives policy; Net metering; Output data; Policy options; Rooftop solar policy; Viet Nam; Solar energy; assessment method; electricity supply; energy policy; policy implementation; solar power; tariff structure","","","The authors of this article would like to show their appreciation to the members of 100% Renewable Energy Lab, Hanoi University of Science and Technology for their support in the drafting process of this article.

The loading tests were performed on CFRP-retrofitted specimens with varying anchoring lengths of the CFRP sheets. The results indicated that the proposed retrofitting methods, which employed the intermediate-modulus CFRP type (390-450 GPa) and polyurea putty (a ductile adhesive), delayed the plastic buckling of the flanges and substantially increased the load-carrying capacities, stiffnesses, and ductility capacities of the retrofitted diagonal tension members. Additionally, the polyurea putty effectively suppressed the peeling failure of the CFRP sheets. It maintained the cross-sectional integrity between the steel members and CFRP sheets even after the plastic buckling of the flanges and rupture failure of the CFRP sheets. Further, finite-element analyses accurately reproduced the loading test results by considering the nonlinear bond-slip performance of polyurea putty, anisotropic characteristics of the CFRP sheets, and cyclic plasticity properties of steel. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets; Cyclic loading test; Diagonal tension members; Seismic retrofitting; Steel deck-truss bridges; Tensile and compressive stiffnesses","Adhesives; Buckling; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Cyclic loads; Ductile fracture; Retrofitting; Seismology; Steel fibers; Stiffness; Trusses; Carbon fiber reinforced polymers sheets; Compressive stiffness; Cyclic loading test; Diagonal tension; Diagonal tension member; Seismic retrofitting; Steel deck-truss bridge; Steel decks; Tensile stiffness; Tension members; Truss bridge; Flanges","","","This work was partially supported by The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology under Project No. B2022-DN02-16.

Specimens atDr= 50% of Nam O sand and Dr= 70% of Toyoura sand, and those of Hue clay and Japanese Kaolin clay were consolidated under the vertical stress of σνο = 49 kPa. They were then subjected to undrained cyclic shear for various cyclic shear directions and wide ranges of the number of cycles and shear strain amplitudes. Under the same cyclic shearing conditions, specimens of sand at higher Dr (Toyoura sand) and clay with higher Atterberg’s limits (Kaolin) show a lower pore water pressure ratio. The number of cycles and the cumulative shear strain at the starting point of pore water pressure generation were observed for different soils and testing conditions. In addition, using the cumulative shear strain, a new strain path parameter, the effects of shear strain amplitude and cyclic shear direction can be captured, resulting in a unique - G* relation on each soil.

In the pristine ZIF-204, the tetrahedral methane molecule anchors to an open monocopper site via the so-called η2 configuration with a physisorption energy of 0.24 eV. This weak binding arises from an electrostatic interaction between the negative charge of carbon in the methane molecule and the positive Cu2+ cation in the framework. In the modified ZIF-204, the doped oxo species is stabilized at the axial position of a CuN<inf>4</inf>-base square pyramid at a distance of 2.06 Å. The dative covalent bond between Cu and oxo is responsible for the formation energy of 1.06 eV. With the presence of the oxo group, the presenting of electrons in the O_p<inf>z</inf> orbital accounts for the adsorption of methane via hydrogen bonding with an adsorption energy of 0.30 eV. The methane oxidation can occur via either a concerted direct oxo insertion mechanism or a hydrogen-atom abstraction radical rebound mechanism. Calculations on transition-state barriers show that reactions via the concerted direct oxo insertion mechanism can happen without energy barriers. Concerning the hydrogen-atom abstraction radical rebound mechanism, the C-H bond dissociation of the CH<inf>4</inf> molecule is barrierless, but the C-O bond recombination to form the CH<inf>3</inf>OH molecule occurs through a low barrier of 0.16 eV. These predictions suggest the modified ZIF-204 is a promising catalyst for methane oxidization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Abstracting; Atoms; Density functional theory; Hydrogen bonds; Molecules; Organometallics; Bio-mimetics; Conversion of methanes; DFT-based; Direct conversion; Direct oxidation; Hydrogen atom abstraction; Insertion mechanism; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Methane molecules; Oxidation of methane; Methane","","","This research was funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number C2022-50-03.

In recent decades, many techniques have been developed to enhance the performance of this algorithm, such as the Improve Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (ISADE) algorithm. Based on the analysis of the aspects that may improve the performance of ISADE, we proposed a modified ISADE version with applying the Gauss distribution for mutation procedure. In ISADE, to determine the scaling factor (F), the population is ranked, then, based on the rank number, population size, and current generation, the formula of the Sigmoid function is used. In the proposed algorithm, F is amplified by a factor which is generated based on Gaussian distribution. It has the potential to enhance the variety of population. In comparison with several reference algorithms regarding converging speed and the consistency of optimal solutions, the simulation results reveal the performance of the suggested algorithm is exceptional. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","differential evolution; Gauss distribution; mutation procedure; optimization algorithm","","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-036.; Funding text 2: This work was also supported by the Centennial SIT Action for the 100th anniversary of Shibaura Institute of Technology to enter the top ten Asian Institute of Technology.","Storn, Rainer, Differential Evolution - A Simple and Efficient Heuristic for Global Optimization over Continuous Spaces, Journal of Global Optimization, 11, 4, pp. 341-359, (1997); Doc Math Extra, (2012); A Treatise of Algebra both Historical and Practical, (1685); Qin, A.

Additionally, open-source hardware and field-programable gate arrays (FPGAs) are gaining traction via newly developed tools, frameworks, and HDLs. This enables new methods of creating hardware and systems faster, more simply, and more efficiently. In this paper, the implementation of a system-on-chip (SoC) based on a 32-bit RISC-V processor with lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores in FPGA and an open-source integrating framework is presented. The system consists of a 32-bit VexRiscv processor, written in SpinalHDL, and lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores for the PRINCE block cipher, the PRESENT-80 block cipher, the ChaCha stream cipher, and the SHA3-512 hash function, written in Verilog HDL and optimized for low latency with fewer clock cycles. The primary aim of this work was to develop a customized SoC platform with a register-controlled bus suitable for integrating lightweight cryptographic cores to become compact embedded systems that require encryption functionalities. Additionally, custom firmware was developed to verify the functionality of the SoC with all integrated accelerator cores, and to evaluate the speed of cryptographic processing. The proposed system was successfully implemented in a Xilinx Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board. The resources of the system in the FPGA were low with 11,830 LUTs and 9552 FFs.

This study aims to apply a small pilot of TiO<inf>2</inf> in the ceramic form to remove carbamazepine (CBZ) from an aqueous solution under simulated sunlight. A high removal efficiency up to >99% was shown in a 5 mg L−1 CBZ solution after 6 h of irradiation with a total energy of 150.92 kJ. The kinetic degradation was not affected in an alkaline solution (at pH 7, pH 10, and pH 13) but was faster under acidic conditions (pH 2) in which CBZ existed in the protonated form. The presence of NO<inf>3</inf>− (10–50 mg L−1) slightly affected the photodegradation of CBZ while humic acid significantly reduced the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the presence of major ions in water also had a negative effect at concentrations between 10 and 50 mg L−1. The MS/MS was used to identify the transformation products of CBZ, and a possible degradation mechanism was proposed. The toxicity of CBZ and the by-products was primarily evaluated. The results showed that TiO<inf>2</inf> ceramics show high reusability and stability with a photocatalytic performance of >95% and a mass loss of <5% after 90 degradation cycles. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbamazepine; MS/MS identification; photo-degradation; photocatalysis; TiO2 ceramic; water treatment","Alkalinity; Amides; Degradation; Dyes; Photocatalytic activity; Reusability; Solar light; Water treatment; Carbamazepine; Degradation pathways; Environmental factors; Kinetic effect; MS/MS identification; Photo degradation; Photo-catalysts; Photocatalytic activities; Simulated solar light; TiO2 ceramic; Titanium dioxide; aqueous solution; ceramics; environmental factor; humic acid; photodegradation; toxicity; water treatment","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH), Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) for Emerging Research Group (Decision number: 1077/Q\u0110-\u0110HKHCN).; Funding text 2: This research was supported in part by the Kurita Asia Research Grant (Grant number: 22Pvn009-R3) provided by Kurita Water and Environment Foundation.

Instead, we conducted a nuanced analysis of self-assessments provided by 364 household heads in the Nam Dong District, Thua Thien Hue Province, Vietnam, to gain a comprehensive understanding of household resilience. Our investigation focused on two upland communities—the Kinh majority and Co Tu ethnic minority households—evaluating their resilience levels in terms of the five livelihood capitals and identifying significant disparities among different ethnic and gender groups. Our findings reveal notable differences in livelihood resilience to climate change and variability among these groups, particularly for women, the poor, and ethnic minorities who exhibit lower resilience levels. This underscores the need for policies and programs designed to improve resilience capacity while taking into account these groups’ cultural and social norms. We suggest focusing on improving financial, human, and social capitals to increase households’ resilience to external shocks. Specifically, building resilience for disadvantaged groups must go hand in hand with promoting their overall well-being and alleviating poverty. Additionally, we recommend tailored training programs to raise awareness among households and strengthening institutional systems to enhance overall resilience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","climate change and variability; intersectional perspective; livelihood resilience; Vietnam","climate change; climate variation; ethnic minority; gender; household survey; livelihood; Nam Dong; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by the Centre for Climate Change Study in Central Vietnam, University of Agriculture and Forestry, Hue University.","Ipcc Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation, (2011); Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis, (2021); Climate Change 2022 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2022); Phuong, Tran Thi, Livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Indexes and insights from two ethnic minority communities in Central Vietnam, Environmental Challenges, 10, (2023); Dinh, Nguyen Cong, Long-Term Improvement in Precautions for Flood Risk Mitigation: A Case Study in the Low-Lying Area of Central Vietnam, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 12, 2, pp. 250-266, (2021); Yen, Nguyen Thi Bich, Determinants of livelihood vulnerability to climate change: Two minority ethnic communities in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam, Environmental Science and Policy, 123, pp. 11-20, (2021); Tran, Van Thanh, Nuanced assessment of livelihood resilience through the intersectional lens of gender and ethnicity: Evidence from small-scale farming communities in the upland regions of Vietnam, Journal of Rural Studies, 92, pp. 68-78, (2022); Tran, Phuong Thi P., A Nuanced Analysis on Livelihood Resilience of Vietnamese Upland Households: An Intersectional Lens of Ethnicity and Gender, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 4, (2023); Tanner, Thomas M., Livelihood resilience in the face of climate change, Nature Climate Change, 5, 1, pp. 23-26, (2015); Ha, Vo Hoang, Post-flood recovery in the central coastal plain of Vietnam: determinants and policy implications, Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science, 6, 3, pp. 899-929, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22251154","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153776375"

It is thus urgent to examine their perceptions of the potential risks, their coping strategies, and the factors influencing their adaptation decisions in agriculture production. By exploring adaptation measures of the Xo Dang and Co Tu EMFs in Quang Nam province, Central Vietnam, the study results reveal that the EMFs are increasingly conscious of local climate shocks in the recent decade; as a result, they have applied multiple specific strategies in agriculture production to mitigate risks. The findings indicate that the key variables of the age of the household head, income, household size, residence period at the locality, and farmers' perception of climate change significantly influenced the households’ adaptation decisions. Recognizing this, the study proposed specific recommendations and policy implications to minimize risks while maximizing benefits for the EMFs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation decisions; Agriculture production; Central Vietnam; Climate change; Ethnic minority farmers (EMFs)","","","","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by Hue University under the Core Research Program, Grant No. NCM.

However, the DAB3 topology has limited soft-switching range, particularly under light load conditions when the voltage conversion ratio differs significantly from unity, resulting in hard switching, increased loss, and higher electromagnetic interference. To address these issues, various techniques have been proposed, but they often lead to other problems such as higher current ripple or unbalanced thermal distribution. In this paper, a new modulation scheme, called symmetric duty-cycle control (SDM), is proposed for DAB3 converters to overcome these issues. A multiaspect comparison of SDM was conducted against two existing techniques, SPS and ADCC, and its superiority was validated through simulation and experimental results. Our proposed SDM scheme provides a current ripple within 10% to 15% of the average current and enables zero current switching for the whole voltage and power ranges. Additionally, a modified version of SDM can even improve overall efficiency by 7% compared to the conventional SPS technique. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","asymmetric duty-cycle control; dual active bridge; single-phase-shift; symmetric duty-cycle control","electric vehicle; electromagnetic method; equipment component; experimental study; model validation; topology","","","This study was funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2021-SAHEP-005.","Kempton, Willett M., Vehicle-to-grid power implementation: From stabilizing the grid to supporting large-scale renewable energy, Journal of Power Sources, 144, 1, pp. 280-294, (2005); Ota, Yutaka, Autonomous distributed V2G (vehicle-to-grid) satisfying scheduled charging, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 1, pp. 559-564, (2012); Chandra Mouli, Gautham Ram, Implementation of dynamic charging and V2G using Chademo and CCS/Combo DC charging standard, (2016); Chandra-Mouli, Gautham Ram, A 10 kW Solar-Powered Bidirectional EV Charger Compatible with Chademo and COMBO, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 34, 2, pp. 1082-1098, (2019); Inoue, Shigenori, A bidirectional DC-DC converter for an energy storage system with galvanic isolation, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 22, 6, pp. 2299-2306, (2007); Ting, Pang, A three phase ZVS bidirectional DC-DC converter, (2008); De Doncker, Rik W.A.A., A Three-Phase Soft-Switched High-Power-Density DC/DC Converter for High-Power Applications, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 27, 1, pp. 63-73, (1991); Zhao, Biao, Overview of dual-active-bridge isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter for high-frequency-link power-conversion system, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 29, 8, pp. 4091-4106, (2014); He, Peiwen, Comprehensive Analyses and Comparison of 1 kW Isolated DC-DC Converters for Bidirectional EV Charging Systems, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 3, 1, pp. 147-156, (2017); Haghbin, Saeid, The Design and Construction of Transformers for a 50 kW Three-Phase Dual Active Bridge DC/DC Converter, 2018-January, pp. 1-5, (2017)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186213194"

One potential route of exposure, atmospheric particulate matter (APM), for polar PPCP chemicals has to date received limited attention. This study screened for 190 polar PPCP chemicals in outdoor APM samples collected from two locations in Hanoi, Vietnam, and predictions of source and potential effects on human health are presented. Day and night, as well as dry and rainy seasonal samples, were taken, and samples screened by LC-TOF, using sequential window acquisition and all theoretical fragment ion spectra method. Eleven PPCP chemicals were detected above the LOD and in more than one sample. The ∑11PPCP chemicals ranged from 0.61 to 21.9 ng m−3 (median 2.07 ng m−3), with between 2 and 6 compounds identified in individual samples (median 4). The ∑11PPCP chemicals collected near a heavy traffic area was greater than that in a populated residential zone. Night concentrations were significantly greater than day in both dry and rainy seasons (p < 0.05). Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, benzophenone-3, acetaminophen, cotinine, and fluorescent brightener 71 were detected in > 50% of samples. These are typically found in sunscreens, cosmetics, antipyretics, tobacco, and dyes. The DI<inf>air</inf>, hazard quotient (HQ), and hazard index (HI) for adults and children at sampling sites were estimated. The HQ for both adults and children were orders of magnitude less than the risk or were close to or whichever. APM does appear to be a potential additional secondary exposure source of PPCP chemicals to the environment and more work is needed to identify if sources are local or ubiquitous and if there is a greater health risk. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric particulate matter; LC-QTOF-MS-SWATH; PPCPs; Risk assessment; Screening analysis","atmospheric pollution; particulate matter; pollutant source; PPCP; risk assessment; Hanoi; Viet Nam; cosmetic; drug; adult; child; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; water pollutant; Adult; Child; Cosmetics; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Risk Assessment; Vietnam; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","Cosmetics; Particulate Matter; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was supported by a bilateral joint research project between Japan Society for the Promotion of Science – Japan (project No. JPJSBP1 20199604) and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology – Vietnam (VAST, project code: QTJP01.01/19–21).","Hoang, Anhquoc, A preliminary investigation of 942 organic micro-pollutants in the atmosphere in waste processing and urban areas, northern Vietnam: Levels, potential sources, and risk assessment, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 167, pp. 354-364, (2019); List of Uv Filters Which Cosmetic Products May Contain for the Purpose of this Directive, (2019); Boxall, Alistair B.A., Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: What are the big questions?, Environmental Health Perspectives, 120, 9, pp. 1221-1229, (2012); Bradley, Paul M., Biotransformation of caffeine, cotinine, and nicotine in stream sediments: Implications for use as wastewater indicators, Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 26, 6, pp. 1116-1121, (2007); Buck Louis, Germaine M., Urinary concentrations of benzophenone-type ultraviolet radiation filters and couples' fecundity, American Journal of Epidemiology, 180, 12, pp. 1168-1175, (2014); Calafat, Antonia M., Concentrations of the sunscreen agent benzophenone-3 in residents of the United States: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004, Environmental Health Perspectives, 116, 7, pp. 893-897, (2008); Cedrón, Vanessa P., Acetaminophen affects the survivor, pigmentation and development of craniofacial structures in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, Biochemical Pharmacology, 174, (2020); Chau, Hong Thi Cam, Development of a comprehensive screening method for more than 300 organic chemicals in water samples using a combination of solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24, 34, pp. 26396-26409, (2017); Chau, Hong Thi Cam, Occurrence of 1153 organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment of Vietnam, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 25, 8, pp. 7147-7156, (2018); Chen, Yixiang, A review on organophosphate flame retardants in indoor dust from China: Implications for human exposure, Chemosphere, 260, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09441344; 16147499","","ESPLE","36520291","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143991204"

The external features, such as irradiance and temperature, are measured by the weather station. However, the irradiance and the temperature measured from measurement instruments are not representative of the energy and the heat that the PV modules receive. The internal factors, such as resistance, are difficult to identify since they are not physically present in the PV modules. One of the trending research directions is to utilize the output characteristics of the PV module to determine the operating conditions of the PV module. This paper presents a method to identify external features (solar irradiance and temperature) and internal resistances by employing the I–V characteristics of the PV module. The proposed method is based on the regression model, which uses the experimental I–V values from the I–V​ tracer. In addition, a method to obtain irradiance from the maximum power point current in the recent literature is employed for the comparison. The simulation results show that the estimation accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of the referenced method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Photovoltaics; PV cell temperature estimation; Regression model; Resistance estimation; Solar irradiance estimation","Regression analysis; Solar panels; Solar radiation; Cell's temperatures; Irradiance estimation; Photovoltaic cell temperature estimation; Photovoltaic modules; Photovoltaics; Regression modelling; Resistance estimation; Solar irradiance estimation; Solar irradiances; Temperature estimation; Solar power generation","","","This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2020-SAHEP-005 .","Abe, Caio Felippe, Combining Identification and Translation Methods of the Single-Diode Model to Compute the Average Temperature of Photovoltaic Modules from the Open-Circuit Voltage, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 9, 5, pp. 1398-1404, (2019); Abe, Caio Felippe, Computing Solar Irradiance and Average Temperature of Photovoltaic Modules from the Maximum Power Point Coordinates, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 10, 2, pp. 655-663, (2020); undefined, (2015); Ciulla, Giuseppina, Forecasting the cell temperature of PV modules with an adaptive system, International Journal of Photoenergy, 2013, (2013); Tan, Rodney H.G., Solar irradiance estimation based on photovoltaic module short circuit current measurement, (2013); Parameters Estimation for A Model of Photovoltaic Panels, (2009); Petrone, G., Photovoltaic Sources Modeling, pp. 1-186, (2017); Pindado, Santiago, Simplified Lambert W-Function Math Equations When Applied to Photovoltaic Systems Modeling, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 57, 2, pp. 1779-1788, (2021); Lappalainen, Kari, Virtual Sensing of Photovoltaic Module Operating Parameters, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, 10, 3, pp. 852-862, (2020); Villalva, Marcelo Gradella, Comprehensive approach to modeling and simulation of photovoltaic arrays, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 24, 5, pp. 1198-1208, (2009)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524847","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141260342"

While many previous conventional attempts to measure resilience at the household level have largely employed the “objective” top-down framework relying mostly on a macro observed socioeconomic dataset, this present work seeks to estimate household resilience through an alternative bottom-up method, called the “subjective” resilience approach. With specific reference to the context of two ethnic Pa Cô and Tà Ôi minorities living in upland areas of Central Vietnam, this study aims to (1) measure household resilience to climate change by scoring five livelihood capitals, financial, human, social, physical, and natural, by applying the Household Livelihood Resilience (HLR) framework; and (2) provide an intersectional lens of ethnicity and gender in relation to the household’s livelihood resilience. To achieve these goals, in addition to two focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews, an empirical survey of 236 households was conducted between September to December 2021. Our findings indicated that there are differences in observed livelihood resilience among the ethnic minority groups and, within that, between gender (sex, status) factors. Ethnic women and poor households have a lower resilience than other groups in society due to their lower human capital and limited access to public and financial resources, which are to some degree linked to the difference in the gender division of labor and the cultural norms of patriarch traditions.

It enables the robot to navigate its environment, which consists primarily of obstacles and moving objects. Robot navigation employing impediment detections, such as walls and pillars, is not only essential but also challenging due to real-world complications. This study provides a real-time solution to the problem of obtaining hallway scenes from an exclusive image. The authors predict a dense scene using a multi-scale fully convolutional network (FCN). The output is an image with pixel-by-pixel predictions that can be used for various navigation strategies. In addition, a method for comparing the computational cost and precision of various FCN architectures using VGG-16 is introduced. The binary semantic segmentation and optimal obstacle avoidance navigation of autonomous mobile robots are two areas in which our method outperforms the methods of competing works. The authors successfully apply perspective correction to the segmented image in order to construct the frontal view of the general area, which identifies the available moving area. The optimal obstacle avoidance strategy is comprised primarily of collision-free path planning, reasonable processing time, and smooth steering with low steering angle changes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","computer vision; fully convolutional networks; mobile robot; navigation; obstacle avoidance; semantic segmentation","","","","This research is funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2022-PC-029.

Herein, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the N<inf>2</inf> dissociation mechanism on models of unsupported Ru(0001) terraces, Ru B5 sites, and polar MgO(111)-supported Ru<inf>8</inf> cluster mimicking a B5 site geometry, denoted (Ru<inf>8</inf>(B5-like)/MgO(111)). The activation energy of N<inf>2</inf> dissociative adsorption on the Ru<inf>8</inf>(B5-like)/MgO(111) model (E<inf>a</inf> = 0.33 eV) is much lower than that on the unsupported Ru(0001) terrace (E<inf>a</inf> = 1.74 eV) and Ru B5 (E<inf>a</inf> = 0.62 eV) models. The lower N<inf>2</inf> dissociation barrier on Ru B5 sites is facilitated by the enhanced σ donation and π* back-donation between N<inf>2</inf>(σ, π*) and Ru(d) orbitals resulting in the stronger activation of the molecular side-on N<inf>2</inf>* dissociation precursor. The Ru<inf>8</inf>(B5-like)/MgO(111) also exhibits enhanced σ donation because of the B5-like cluster geometry. Furthermore, the Ru cluster of the bare Ru<inf>8</inf>(B5-like)/MgO(111) model is positively charged. This induced an unusual π donation from N<inf>2</inf>(π) to Ru(d) orbitals as revealed by analyses of the density of states and partial charge densities. The combined σ and π donation resulted in an increased synergistic π* back-donation. The total interactions between N<inf>2</inf>(σ, π, π*) and Ru(d) resulted in an overall electron transfer to the adsorbed N<inf>2</inf> from the Ru atoms in the B5-like site with no direct involvement of the MgO(111) substrate. Analyses of bond stretching vibrations and bond lengths show that the N<inf>2</inf>(σ, π, π*) and Ru(d) interactions lead to a weaker N-N bond and stronger Ru-N bonds. These correspond to a lower barrier of N<inf>2</inf> dissociation on the Ru<inf>8</inf>(B5-like)/MgO(111) model, where the highest red-shift of N-N vibration and the longest N-N bond length were observed after side-on N<inf>2</inf>* adsorption. These results demonstrate that an electron-deficient Ru catalyst are not always inhibited from donating electrons to adsorbed N<inf>2</inf>. Rather, this study shows that the electron deficiency of Ru can promote π* back-donation and N<inf>2</inf> activation. These new insights may therefore open new avenues to design supported Ru catalysts for nitrogen activation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Activation energy; Adsorption; Ammonia; Bond length; Magnesia; Photodissociation; Red Shift; Ruthenium; Stretching; Vibration analysis; Ammonia synthesis; Back-donation; D orbitals; Density-functional theory calculations; Dissociation mechanisms; Dissociative adsorption; Mechanistics; Rate determining step; Ru catalysts; Thermal; Density functional theory","","","Y.

Knowledge of the genetic basis of limb organogenesis in bats has increased but little has been documented regarding the differences between limb organogenesis in bats and that of other vertebrates. We conducted embryological comparisons of the timelines of limb organogenesis in 24 bat species and 72 non-bat amniotes. In bats, the time invested for forelimb organogenesis has been considerably extended and the appearance timing of the forelimb ridge has been significantly accelerated, whereas the timing of the finger and first appearance of the claw development has been delayed, facilitating the enlargement of the manus. Furthermore, we discovered that bats initiate the development of their hindlimbs earlier than their forelimbs compared with other placentals. Bat neonates are known to be able to cling continuously with their well-developed foot to the maternal bodies or habitat substrates soon after birth. We suggest that this unique life history of neonates, which possibly coevolved with powered flight, has driven the accelerated development of the hindlimb and precocious foot. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bat; flight; limb development; neonate","bat; biological development; evolution; flight activity; life history; limb; neonate; animal; flying; forelimb; genetics; hindlimb; human; newborn; organogenesis; placental mammal; vertebrate; Animals; Chiroptera; Eutheria; Flight, Animal; Forelimb; Hindlimb; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Organogenesis; Vertebrates","","","This study was supported by grants from JSPS (grant nos 18KK0207, 18K19359, 18H04816, 21H02546, 21K19291 and 22KK0101) and JST (grant no.

Although preliminary and fragmentary, as we were only able to observe them for a short period of time between March 18–23, 2023, we report here the first observations on the biology of the species in captivity, focusing on their preying behavior on centipedes. We captured two colonies (possibly fragments, containing several or many alate and dealate queens and no immatures) and a solitary dealate queen of O. hungvuong in Pu Hoat Nature Reserve, Nghe An, Vietnam. We could not confirm whether the two colonies contained mated reproductive queens and whether the solitary dealate queen was mated. We observed their reactions by offering some centipedes and juliform millipedes. Individuals from the colonies ignored juvenile juliform millipedes but readily paralyzed a geophilomorph (Mecistocephalus sp.), a lithobiomorph (Lithobius sp.), and two juvenile scolopendromorph centipedes (Scolopocryptops sp.) by stinging. Not only workers but also alate and dealate queens in the colonies aggressively attacked the centipedes. However, they failed to hunt a linotaeniid geophilomorph centipede (Strigamia sp.); the ants were quickly killed probably due to the chemical defense of the centipede. The solitary dealate queen also readily paralyzed a juvenile Scolopocryptops by sophisticated hunting behavior. The workers and dealate queens of O. hungvuong showed eager (apparently hemolymph) licking behavior on the paralyzed Mecistocephalus centipede. Our observations indicate that O. hungvuong is well-adapted for preying on certain active centipedes, although their exact prey repertoire and degree of prey specialization remain uncertain. Some other notes on their habitat, ovariole number, venom apparatus, and unique metasomal habitus are provided. We also discuss the functional roles of some female caste morphologies of O. hungvuong in their centipede hunting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","chemical defense; Chilopoda; Leptanillomorpha; predator–prey interaction; subterranean ant; Vietnam","","","","We would like to thank Drs Nguyen Van Sinh (Director of the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources (IEBR), Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam), Truong Xuan Lam (Vice Director of IEBR), Nguyen Duc Anh (IEBR), Nguyen Quang Cuong (IEBR), and the staff of Pu Hoat Nature Reserve for their help in the field survey and managing research permissions; Dr Nguyen Thi Phuong Lien (IEBR) for kindly allowing us to use microscopes and video/image recording systems in IEBR; Dr Sho Tsukamoto for his advice on the identification of centipedes; two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and critiques on the manuscript.

Sampling survey and social survey were conducted to collect data. Material flow analysis was utilised to analyse the flow of the BSW. Results denoted that the generated BSW flowed in five directions namely home husbandry, home composting, formal collecting without separation, segregated collection by informal sectors and leakage to the environment. Proportions of such waste streams are not the same across city types, waste management systems, and consumer markets. The daily biodegradable waste generation amounts were estimated at 612.12 tons in Danang city (DNC), 318.65 tons in Hue city (HUC), and 65.28 tons in Hoi An city (HAC). Most of biodegradable waste was managed by the formal waste collection system with 89 %, 73 %, and 88 % for DNC, HUC, and HAC. Interestingly, HAC was the only area operating composting facility with 49 % of biodegradable waste being recycled. The study also revealed an unsung informal sector of the BSW, operating in an unforeseen routine compared with itinerant recyclable-waste buyers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors are thankful to University of Technology and Education — The University of Danang, Hue University, People’s Committee of Danang city, People’s Committee of Hue city, People’s Committee of Hoi An city, Danang Urban Environment Company, Hue Urban Environment And Public Works Joint Stock Company, Hang Trung Limited Company, and Hoi An Public Work Company for supporting the survey.

The mixing of domestic waste in collection and treatment has brought significant environmental consequences. The waste separation policy towards strategic goals in waste management has posed many challenges for the locality in implementation. This study aims to develop a pilot of the thermal composting system to optimize the household organic waste composting process. The pilot has a volume of 12 L, a bottom heating system, and a temperature measurement and monitoring system. The system operates on a batch mechanism; the first batch is started with the addition of sawdust substrate at a rate of 1/3 of the volume of food waste. From the 2nd batch onwards, 1/3 of the compost product is kept in the system to mix with the raw materials. The heating system only provides a temperature of 40 °C during the first 2 d of the treatment. The results show that the thermal-composting system is activated quickly in the first 2 d, and the treatment process is highly effective in the next 3 d with temperatures ranging from 60 to 70 °C. The pile volume decreased rapidly by 50 % within 5 d of treatment and stabilized gradually in the last 2 d. After 7 d of treatment, the compost has a temperature of about 40 °C with a moisture content of 31.3 %. Compost products have high organic content (57.8 %), low nutrient content, and heavy metal content below the allowable threshold in microbial organic fertilizers standards (TCVN 7185:2002). Efficiency in home composting with a shortened retention time of 7 d, simple operation, and friendly compost quality are the outstanding results of this applied research. This study provides a practical product for implementing new waste management regulations in Vietnam. It also awakens the potential to promote the municipal organic solid waste recycling system, contributing to reducing the waste to landfills and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions towards a waste circular economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank the GSGES Seeds Funding Programme 2022 of the Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, and The University of Danang for financial assistance and collaboration in this study.","Ahn, Hee Kwon, Mass and thermal balance during composting of a poultry manure-Wood shavings mixture at different aeration rates, Process Biochemistry, 42, 2, pp. 215-223, (2007); Atieno, Mary, Assessment of biofertilizer use for sustainable agriculture in the Great Mekong Region, Journal of Environmental Management, 275, (2020); Cui, Peng, Hyperthermophilic composting reduces nitrogen loss via inhibiting ammonifiers and enhancing nitrogenous humic substance formation, Science of the Total Environment, 692, pp. 98-106, (2019); Elango, D., Thermophilic composting of municipal solid waste, Applied Energy, 86, 5, pp. 663-668, (2009); Kalemelawa, Frank, An evaluation of aerobic and anaerobic composting of banana peels treated with different inoculums for soil nutrient replenishment, Bioresource Technology, 126, pp. 375-382, (2012); Liu, Chen, Food waste in Japan: Trends, current practices and key challenges, Journal of Cleaner Production, 133, pp. 557-564, (2016); National Environmental Status Report Topic Municipal Solid Waste Management, (2020); Pham Phu, Song Toan, ORIENTED-PLANNING SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN VIETNAM TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY - MINIMALISM OR OPTIMIZATION, Environmental Engineering and Management Journal, 21, 9, pp. 1533-1543, (2022); Sabki, Mirza Hussein, A review on the economic feasibility of composting for organic waste management in Asian countries, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 70, pp. 49-54, (2018); Pham Phu, Song Toan, Home-Composting - A Study on the Simplicity of the System in the Application toward the Effectiveness and Feasibility in Spreading in Vietnam, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 89, pp. 505-510, (2021)","","Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC","","","","","","22839216","9788895608419; 9788895608372; 9788895608426; 9788895608143; 9788895608051; 9788895608624; 9788895608112; 9788895608617; 9788895608648; 9788895608365","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183477733"

An external comparison showed that C. himalayica is larger than C. varennei. The mean (M) of skull measurements was used as an independent variable to regress the coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SD). The CVs did not differ significantly between two species and exhibited an inverse relationship with the M of skull measurements. CV trends of major functional parts of the skull showed that incisor length, brain-case size, postglenoid breadth, and mandible length presented opposing differences between the two species. In addition, C. himalayica had the highest allometric coefficient for the overall skull length, whereas C. varennei had the highest allometric coefficient for the postorbital region.

The monthly mean EIA crests amplitudes are calculated. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram method was applied to the residuals of the EIA crests magnitudes, ATEC, which are obtained from subtracting the fittings with solar index, F10.7. The Lomb-Scargle spectrum shows the quasi-biennial component in the residuals ATEC with the picks at 18, 25, and 29-30 months. The ionosphere QBO at two EIA crests was found out by the band-pass filter centered at 25 months with haft-power points at 17 and 33 months. The zonal wind data at 50 hPa (~20 km) of the tropical equatorial stratosphere is used as the stratosphere QBO (SQBO) to consider the relationship between the SQBO and the obtained ionosphere QBO. The direct comparison and the cross wavelet transform of the SQBO and ionosphere QBO data series show that during 2008-2009, the ionosphere QBO signal is low, the SQBO and ionosphere QBO are in phase during the 2010-2013 and 2018-2021 periods, but anti-phase during the 2014-2017 period. For the 2010-2013, 2014-2017 and 2018-2021 periods, the correlation coefficients are 0.623, -0.646, 0.637 in the northern crest, and 0.571, -0.530,0.530 in the southern crest, respectively. Furthermore, we also observed that the SQBO and the ionosphere QBO signals were shortened during the 2015-2016 period, approximately 1.5 years. Previous studies showed that the ENSO (El Niño - Southern Oscillation) warm phase, also known as El-Niño existed during 2015-2016. The results of this study allow us to assume that the SQBO influences the ionosphere QBO. Our results show that the SQBO is the main factor affecting the ionospheric QBO at two EIA crests. However, the physical theoretical interpretation of the mechanisms of action is a challenge for scientists and requires further research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ATEC; Equatorial Ionization Anomaly; GNSS; ionosphere QBO; Southeast Asian region; Stratosphere Quasi-Biennial Oscillations (SQBO)","","","","We are thankful to the anonymous referees for reviewing and helping us to improve our paper and to the IGS Community for making available GNSS data.

Although Rousettus has been regarded as the only pteropodid capable of echolocation using tongue clicks, recent evidence suggests that other species of pteropodids are also capable of echolocation using wing clicks. Studies on laryngeal echolocators suggest that delicate ear movements are essential for the echolocation behavior of bats and that the cervicoauricularis muscles play a critical role in such ear movements. In this study, we observed the gross anatomy of cervicoauricularis muscles in three species of pteropodids (Cynopterus sphinx, Eonycteris spelaea, and Rousettus leschenaultii) to examine whether ear muscle anatomy varies among pteropodids with different echolocation types and between pteropodids and laryngeal echolocating bats. We found that M. cervicoauricularis profundus originates from the nuchal crest in tongue-click echolocators (R. leschenaultii) and from the midline in wing-click echolocators (C. sphinx and E. spelaea). In general, tongue-click echolocation using high click rates is considered to be more sophisticated in terms of sonar performance than wing-click echolocation. M. cervicoauricularis profundus originating from the nuchal crest (CPNC) is not common in non-bat laurasiatherian mammals, but can be found in laryngeal echolocating bats. As it pulls the ear pinna caudally in the horizontal plane and increases the access to sound, CPNC found in R. leschenaultii and laryngeal echolocating bats may be a key characteristic of the sophisticated active echolocation behavior of bats. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","comparative anatomy; echolocation; evolution; skull","article; auricle; comparative anatomy; echolocation; flying fox; larynx; Laurasiatheria; muscle; nonhuman; Rousettus; skull; sound; tongue; wing; animal; bat; evolution; physiology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Chiroptera; Ear Auricle; Echolocation; Muscles","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

While rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans are capable of laryngeal echolocation, pteropodids lack this ability. Delicate ear movements are essential for echolocation behavior in bats with laryngeal echolocation. Caudal auricular muscles, especially the cervicoauricularis group, play a critical role in such ear movements. Previously, caudal auricular muscles were studied in three species of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but to our knowledge, there have been no studies on non-laryngeal echolocators, the pteropodids. Here, we describe the gross anatomy of the cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation in Cynopterus sphinx by using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography and 3D reconstructions of immunohistochemically stained serial sections. A previous study on bats with laryngeal echolocation reported that rhinolophoids have four cervicoauricularis muscles and yangochiropterans have three. We observed three cervicoauricularis muscles in the pteropodid C. sphinx. The number of cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation pattern were comparable to those of non-bat boreoeutherian mammals and yangochiropterans, suggesting that pteropodids, and yangochiropterans maintain the general condition of boreoeutherian mammals and that rhinolophoids have a derived condition. The unique nomenclature had been previously applied to the cervicoauricularis muscles of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but given the commonality between non-bat laurasiatherians and bats, with the exception of rhinolophoids, maintaining the conventional nomenclature (i.e., M. cervicoauricularis superficialis, M. cervicoauricularis medius, and M. cervicoauricularis profundus) is proposed for bats. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","comparative anatomy; echolocation; evolution; skull","adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bat; caudal auricular muscle; cervicoauricularis medius muscle; cervicoauricularis profundus muscle; cervicoauricularis superficialis muscle; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; controlled study; Cynopterus sphinx; echolocation; embryo; euthanasia; fetus; flying fox; image reconstruction; immunohistochemistry; micro-computed tomography; microscopy; muscle; nonhuman; phylogeny; rhinolophoid; yangochiropteran; animal; physiology; Animals; Chiroptera; Echolocation; Muscles","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

The effects of droughts on crop production, household expenditure, rural poverty and internal migration in Vietnam were investigated using a unique panel dataset while controlling for potential issues that could lead to biased estimations. We find comprehensive evidence that droughts not only caused a significant decline in rice productivity and rural household consumption, but also pushed them into poverty. Furthermore, droughts are strongly linked to rural people's decisions to migrate to other areas, pushing migration decisions through the productivity, consumption and poverty channels. Understanding the complex relationship between climate change, particularly drought, and its consequences is critical for developing policy interventions to help rural populations cope with climate change risks and uncertainties. These findings emphasize the importance of increasing rural populations’ resilience to climate-related extreme events to mitigate their interconnected effects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drought-induced impacts; farming households; rice production; Vietnam","","","","This work was supported by University of Economics, Hue University; Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED): [Grant Number 504.05-2020.302]; Strong Research Group Program of Hue University.","Adego, Tsega, The impact of adaptation practices on crop productivity in northwest Ethiopia: an endogenous switching estimation, Development Studies Research, 6, 1, pp. 129-141, (2019); Akaakohol, Msoo A., Diversification and farm household welfare in Makurdi, Benue state, Nigeria, Development Studies Research, 1, 1, pp. 168-175, (2014); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Natural Disasters, Household Welfare, and Resilience: Evidence from Rural Vietnam, World Development, 70, pp. 59-77, (2015); undefined, (2021); Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, (2019); Barrios, Salvador, Climatic change and rural-urban migration: The case of sub-Saharan Africa, Journal of Urban Economics, 60, 3, pp. 357-371, (2006); Beine, Michel, Climatic factors as determinants of international migration, Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 117, 2, pp. 723-767, (2015); Berlemann, Michael, Climate change, natural disasters, and migration-a survey of the empirical evidence, CESifo Economic Studies, 63, 4, pp. 353-385, (2017); Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, (2020); Black, Richard, Climate change: Migration as adaptation, Nature, 478, 7370, pp. 447-449, (2011)","","Routledge","","","","","","21665095","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153400132"

LULC has degraded many waterbodies in the region, such as Tri An Reservoir (TAR), one of the largest freshwater bodies in Southern Vietnam. This study investigated the long-term interaction between land use patterns and water quality in the TAR Basin (TARB). Land-use types and landscape metrics were used to investigate the correlation with water physicochemical variables at watershed scale. The results indicated that dense forest area was the most important factor influencing turbidity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and total phosphorous (TP), while the proportion of perennial/orchard mostly influenced total suspended solids (TSS). The built-up/residential area significantly influenced turbidity, TSS, and total dissolved solids (TDS). Several landscape metrics correlated properly with turbidity, indicating that land-use types and landscape metrics in TARB significantly influenced water quality in TAR.

Alongside water resistance, air resistance in strong wind conditions has a significant impact on the fuel efficiency and performance of container ships with large box-type bodies. This paper reports the effects of wind loads acting on a 20,000 TEU container ship carrying large numbers of deck containers using a commercial CFD software program (ANSYS Fluent V14.5 with RANS equation). A 1/255.3 scale model was used in this study to reveal the air resistance on the container ship configuration. The aerodynamic formations of the complex vortices, pressure, velocity contours, and streamlines, as well as the air forces acting on the container ship, are presented and discussed. The pressure distributions show that the gap air flows increase the stagnation pressure at the face side and decrease the pressure on the backside of each container gap through separate eddies. The difference in pressures created in the gaps contribute to the air resistance acting on the ship. It is confirmed that the use of side covers of deck containers to close the gap flows between container blocks can significantly reduce the air resistance for wind directions in the range of 30 to 60 degrees. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","air resistance; CFD; container ship; gap flow","","","","Funding text 1: This project is funded by The University of Danang and the Danang City Department of Science and Technology grant number B2019-DN01-23-HT.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to express their special appreciation and thanks to The University of Danang and the Danang City Department of Science and Technology for the financial support to complete this project.

The flash ADC includes four main blocks—an analog multiplexer (MUX), a comparator, an encoder, and an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) block. The MUX allows the selection between eight analog inputs. The comparator block contains a TIQ (Threshold Inverter Quantization) comparator, a control circuit, and a proposed architecture of a Double-Tail (DT) comparator. The advantage of using the DT comparator is to reduce the number of comparators by half, which helps reduce the design area. The SPI block can provide a simple way for the ADC to interface with microcontrollers. This mixed-signal circuitry is designed and simulated using 180 nm CMOS technology. The 8-bit flash ADC only employs 128 comparators. The applied input clock is 80 MHz, with the input voltage ranging from 0.6 V to 1.8 V. The comparator block outputs 127 bits of thermometer code and sends them to the encoder, which exports the seven least significant bits (LSB) of the binary code. The most significant bit (MSB) is decided by only one DT comparator. The design consumes 2.81 mW of power on average. The total area of the layout is 0.088 mm2. The figure of merit (FOM) is about 877 fJ/step.

Our results show distinct scattering features when varying the various scattering parameters, thereby allowing the identification of the scattering particle with specific application to the identification of atmospheric pollutants including black carbon. Regardless of the type of scatterer, the scattering intensity is nearly uniform with a slight preference for forward scattering when the size of the particle is within 20% of the incident laser’s wavelength. The scattering patterns start to exhibit distinguishable features when the size parameter equals 1.77, corresponding to an incident laser wavelength of 0.355 μm and a particle radius of 0.1 μm. The patterns then become increasingly unique as the size parameter increases. Based on these calculations, we propose a time-gated lidar scheme consisting of multiple detectors that can rotate through a telescopic angle and be placed equidistantly around the scattering particles to collect the backscattered light and a commercially available Q-switched laser system emitting at tunable laser wavelengths. By using a pulsed laser with 10-ns pulse duration, our scheme could distinguish scattering centers that are at least 3 m apart. Our scheme called MIe Scattering Time-gated multi-Static LIDAR (MISTS–LIDAR) would be capable of identifying the type of atmospheric pollutant and mapping its location with a spatial resolution of a few meters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","atmospheric monitoring of pollutants; black carbon; LIDAR; MIe scattering; particulate matter","","","","This research was funded by the Osaka University ASEAN Campuses, the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under Project No. VAST01.03/22-23 and the Institute of Laser Engineering Collaborative Research Fund (2020B1-003 and 2022B1-004).","undefined; Durdina, Lukas, Nonvolatile Particulate Matter Emissions of a Business Jet Measured at Ground Level and Estimated for Cruising Altitudes, Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 21, pp. 12865-12872, (2019); Panahifar, Hossein, Monitoring atmospheric particulate matters using vertically resolved measurements of a polarization lidar, in-situ recordings and satellite data over Tehran, Iran, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Liu, Zheng, Semi-volatile organic compounds in fine particulate matter on a tropical island in the South China Sea, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 426, (2022); Proceedings of the Awma Specialty Conference Pm 2000; Ross Hallett, F., Particle size analysis by dynamic light scattering, Food Research International, 27, 2, pp. 195-198, (1994); Koestner, Daniel W., Polarized light scattering measurements as a means to characterize particle size and composition of natural assemblages of marine particles, Applied Optics, 59, 27, pp. 8314-8334, (2020); Siebert, Karl J., Relationship of particle size to light scattering, Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists, 58, 3, pp. 97-100, (2000); Lockwood, David J., Rayleigh and Mie Scattering, pp. 1097-1107, (2016); Wyatt, Philip J., Differential light scattering and the measurement of molecules and nanoparticles: A review, Analytica Chimica Acta: X, 7-8, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145843671"

The method can design multiple TMD parameters simultaneously for different modes contributing to multiple resonance peaks. Moreover, the study analyzed the vibration of bridges with uncertain parameters. This study’s motivation is based on the optimal design of TMDs for bridge structures under external forces, such as the loads of moving cars and high-speed trains. In this case, the resonant response phenomenon can only happen at specific frequencies. The proposed optimization was developed based on the H <inf>2</inf> norm method to design the TMD parameters.

It contains two major nucleosides, cordycepin and adenosine, which have been reported to have potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. This paper aimed to study the effect of C. militaris extract on the reproductive function of a mouse model, evaluating possible toxicity, androgenic activity, and protective and rehabilitative effects against damages caused by sodium valproate (VPA). There was no death and abnormalities observed in mice. Androgen activity was also shown in young male rats by an improvement in several sexual organs. The protective effect of C. militaris extract was explained by the gain of sexual organs’ weight, testosterone concentration, and seminiferous tubule size as well as the enhancement of sperm density, alive sperm percentage, and the progressive forward movement of sperm. The pregnancy rate of female rats paired with VPA-administered male rats (500 mg/kg/day) increased proportionally with the higher dose of C. militaris extract. In the rehabilitation study, an incline in the weight of the Cowper’s gland and glans (0.112 g/kg/day) and testicle and prostate (0.336 g/kg/day) as well as an improvement of the sperm forward progressive movement was observed. The percentage of unprogressive sperm and immotile sperm has reduced. These results suggest that C. militaris is a potential supplement to reduce the negative effects of VPA and improve reproductive function, in which the two major constituents cordycepin and adenosine may play an active role. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cordyceps militaris; mouse model; protective activity; rehabilitation activity; sodium valproate","","","","This research was funded by Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under grant number THTEXS.02/21-24.","Semah, Franck, The choice of antiepileptic drugs in newly diagnosed epilepsy: A national French survey, Epileptic Disorders, 6, 4, pp. 255-265, (2004); Mattson, Richard H., Comparison of Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, and Primidone in Partial and Secondarily Generalized Tonic–Clonic Seizures, New England Journal of Medicine, 313, 3, pp. 145-151, (1985); Curtis, Valerie L., Infertility secondary to valproate, Journal of Epilepsy, 7, 4, pp. 259-261, (1994); Isojärvi, Jouko I.T., Effect of antiepileptic drugs on reproductive endocrine function in individuals with epilepsy, CNS Drugs, 19, 3, pp. 207-223, (2005); Nishimura, Tatsuya, Effects of valproic acid on fertility and reproductive organs in male rats, Journal of Toxicological Sciences, 25, 2, pp. 85-93, (2000); Røste, Line Sveberg, Morphological changes in the testis after long-term valproate treatment in male Wistar rats, Seizure, 10, 8, pp. 559-565, (2001); Graf, William David, Altered antioxidant enzyme activities in children with a serious adverse experience related to valproic acid therapy, Neuropediatrics, 29, 4, pp. 195-201, (1998); Klee, Sabine, Evidence for a trigger function of valproic acid in xenobiotic-induced hepatotoxicity, Pharmacology and Toxicology, 87, 2, pp. 89-95, (2000); Bykov, Igor L., Biochemical basis of valproic acid toxicity: Role of oxidative stress and effects of L-carnitine, Biomeditsinskaya Khimiya, 50, 4, pp. 384-389, (2004); Osivand, Asma, Allelopathy of wild mushrooms-An important factor for assessing forest ecosystems in Japan, Forests, 9, 12, (2018)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","26736918","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186225686"

These robots help patients to execute repetitive exercises under the guidance of physiotherapists. Recently, pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM), a kind of actuator that acts similarly to human muscles, have been chosen to power the exoskeleton robot for better human–machine interaction. In order to enhance the performance of a PAM-based exoskeleton robot, this article implements an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy with a nonlinear extended state observer (NLESO). Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved by Lyapunov’s theory.

We tackle a new problem that is how to reduce the cost of 4G while preserving the latency. We propose an offloading strategy that combines a reinforcement learning technique known as Q-learning with Fuzzy logic to accomplish the purpose.

This study aims to investigate the current practice of skin-to-skin contact (SSC) and its effect on exclusive breastfeeding during the hospital stay. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 1812 Vietnamese mothers in multicenter. A questionnaire answered by the mothers was used to assess the duration of both SSC and breastfeeding practices. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify a dose–response relationship between early SSC and prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in hospital. Results: There were 88.7% of mothers experiencing SSC with their infants right after birth and the highest prevalence of SSC was found in district hospitals. Among those experiencing SSC, 18.8% of the infants received more than 90 min of SSC and completed the first breastfeeding during SSC time. Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding during maternity hospital stay was 46.7%. We found a significant dose–response relation between the duration of SSC and exclusive breastfeeding in hospital. Compared with infants without SSC, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was higher in infants who experienced SSC for 15–90 min (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% confidence interval [95%-CI]: 2.62 [1.61–4.27]) and more than 90 min (aOR [95%-CI]: 5.98 [3.48–10.28]). Completed first breastfeeding during SSC time (aOR [95%-CI]: 4.24 [3.28–5.47]) and being born in district hospitals (aOR [95%-CI]: 2.35 [1.79–3.09]) were associated with increased prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding during hospital stay. On the other hand, mother education level as high school/intermediate (aOR [95%-CI]: 0.58 [0.42–0.82]) and place of residence classified as rural decreased odds of exclusive breastfeeding in hospital (aOR [95%-CI]: 0.78 [0.61–0.99]). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a strong dose–response relationship between duration of SSC and exclusive breastfeeding in hospital. Interventions that support exclusive breastfeeding during hospital stay, especially achieving prolonged uninterrupted SSC, could improve the duration of breastfeeding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Breastfeeding; Dose–response relationship; Early Essential Newborn Care; Hospital; Risk factors; Skin to skin contact","article; breast feeding; contact time; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dose response; education; educational status; female; high school; hospitalization; human; human experiment; infant; mother; multicenter study; newborn care; prevalence; public hospital; questionnaire; residence characteristics; risk factor; skin; Vietnamese; clinical trial; newborn; pregnancy; Breast Feeding; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Mothers; Pregnancy; Prevalence","","","This research is funded by Funds for Science and Technology Development of the University of Danang under project number B2020-DN01-28.","Reproductive Maternal Newborn and Child Health Disease Control Priorities, (2016); Lassi, Zohra S., Interventions to Improve Neonatal Health and Later Survival: An Overview of Systematic Reviews, eBioMedicine, 2, 8, pp. 985-1000, (2015); Black, Robert E., Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries, The Lancet, 382, 9890, pp. 427-451, (2013); Infant and Young Child Feeding, (2021); Breastfeeding; Safari, Kolsoom, The effect of mother and newborn early skin-to-skin contact on initiation of breastfeeding, newborn temperature and duration of third stage of labor, International Breastfeeding Journal, 13, 1, (2018); Mikiel-Kostyra, Krystyna, Effect of early skin-to-skin contact after delivery on duration of breastfeeding: A prospective cohort study, Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics, 91, 12, pp. 1301-1306, (2002); Vehling, Lorena, Exclusive breastfeeding in hospital predicts longer breastfeeding duration in Canada: Implications for health equity, Birth, 45, 4, pp. 440-449, (2018); Holmes, Alison Volpe, Establishing Successful Breastfeeding in the Newborn Period, Pediatric Clinics of North America, 60, 1, pp. 147-168, (2013); Chantry, Caroline J., In-hospital formula use increases early breastfeeding cessation among first-time mothers intending to exclusively breastfeed, Journal of Pediatrics, 164, 6, pp. 1339-e5, (2014)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14712431","","BPMEB","35799125","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133606259"

Hence, optimizing the charging schedule of MC is essential to maximize the network lifetime in WRSNs. The existing works only target the local optimization of network lifetime limited to MC's subsequent charging round. The network lifetime has been normally reflected in a different metric that is not directly related to the final charging round period. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address the global maximization of network lifetime in WRSNs, which optimizes not only the subsequent charging round but all charging rounds over the entire network lifetime. Another uniqueness is the joint consideration of both the charging path and charging time optimization problems. As a solution, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA)-based global optimization scheme that considers all the possible charging rounds. The GA has a novel mutation operation that mutates gene sizes for representing charging schedules with a varying number of charging rounds. The experiment results show that our algorithm can extend the network lifetime by 35.1 times on average and 38.6 times in the best case compared to existing ones. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","charging time optimization; genetic algorithm; mixed integer linear programming; network lifetime maximization; Wireless rechargeable sensor networks","Global optimization; Integer programming; Sensor nodes; Charging time; Charging time optimization; Integer Linear Programming; Lifetime maximization; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Network lifetime; Network lifetime maximization; Rechargeable sensor networks; Time optimization; Wireless rechargeable sensor network; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was funded by Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup JSC), Vingroup and supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) under Project Code No. VINIF.2020.DA09, partially funded by Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam under Grant No. B2020-BKA-13, and partially funded by Hanoi University of Science and Technology under Grant No. T2021-PC-019.

In this paper, we consider specific items as positives and inhibitors and non-specific items as negatives. In particular, we consider a novel model called group testing with blocks of positives and inhibitors. A test on a subset of items is positive if the subset contains at least one positive and does not contain any inhibitors, and it is negative otherwise. In this model, the input items are linearly ordered, and the positives and inhibitors are subsets of small blocks (at unknown locations) of consecutive items over that order. We also consider two specific instantiations of this model. The first instantiation is that model that contains a single block of consecutive items consisting of exactly known numbers of positives and inhibitors. The second instantiation is the model that contains a single block of consecutive items containing known numbers of positives and inhibitors. Our contribution is to propose efficient encoding and decoding schemes such that the numbers of tests used to identify only positives or both positives and inhibitors are less than the ones in the state-of-the-art schemes.

Different from most of the previous studies on the landfill site selection, geology-related criteria including soil types/lithology, soil permeability, and soil depth/soil thickness (soil-structure), which are called geo-environmental and geotechnical characteristics in this research, will be carefully considered, integrated, and evaluated. The AHP was employed to determine the weight of each criterion based on pair weight comparison and its matrix, while a land suitability index (LSI) score was calculated to determine the most suitable site. Moreover, the suitability map was also created which indicated very advantageous, advantageous, rather advantageous, and disadvantageous areas in the study area for landfill siting. Finally, the developed model could be used for supporting planners, managers, policy makers, and local government to make decisions on suitable and effective planning strategies for landfill site selection and could be applied anywhere and especially in other deltas around the world. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","analytic hierarchy process; location choice; model builder; planning support; relative weight","Groundwater; Hierarchical systems; Industrial research; Land fill; Land use; Site selection; Soils; Surface waters; Environmental characteristic; Geotechnical characteristics; Hierarchy process; Landfill site selection; Location choice; Mekong Delta; Model builders; Planning support; Relative weights; Solid waste landfill; Geographic information systems","","","Funding text 1: The authors are highly thankful to Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) for financial support.

This new promising trend is becoming widely used in banks and various online services. Thus, eKYC can be a potential target for biometrics spoofing, including possible attacks by deepfake media, such as face swap or manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a potential attack of deepfake photos or videos on eKYC by swapping and manipulating faces between source and target faces. We then propose a novel method to detect fake videos of human faces using a two-stream network. We intend to utilize both the visual appearance and motion of a face in a sequence of pictures. We also propose to encode motion in an image sequence as an average photo which is called a motion-encoded image. Experiments on FaceForensics+ + show that using only a small number of frames in a video, our method can provide high accuracy in both frame-level and video-level prediction. With only 10 frames, our solution achieves the accuracy of 0.9326 and 0.9357 for the frame and video-level accuracy, respectively. If we use up to 50 frames per video, the accuracy of our method increases to 0.9371 and 0.9486 at the frame and video level. Finally, we propose to augment the security of current eKYC systems with deepfake detection. Our solution for deepfake detection can be a promising method to provide extra protection for eKYC solutions with face registration and authentication. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deepfake detection; EKYC; Faceswap; Two-stream network","","","","This research is funded by University of Science, VNU-HCM under grantnumber T2022-85.","undefined, (2017); undefined, (2018); Terrifying High Tech Porn Creepy Deepfake Videos are on the Rise, (2018); Agarwal, Shruti, Detecting deep-fake videos from phoneme-viseme mismatches, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2020-June, pp. 2814-2822, (2020); Agarwal, Shruti, Protecting world leaders against deep fakes, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2019-June, pp. 38-45, (2019); Bappy, Jawadul Hasan, Hybrid LSTM and Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Detection of Image Forgeries, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28, 7, pp. 3286-3300, (2019); Bhattacharjee, Sushil, Recent advances in face presentation attack detection, Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 207-228, (2019); Chen, Haonan, Attention-Based Two-Stream Convolutional Networks for Face Spoofing Detection, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 15, pp. 578-593, (2020); Chollet, François, Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 1800-1807, (2017); Chugh, Komal, Not made for each other- Audio-Visual Dissonance-based Deepfake Detection and Localization, pp. 439-447, (2020)","","Springer","","","","","","26618907; 2662995X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137560025"

The objective of this paper was to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of a rigid strip footing, subjected to eccentrically inclined loads resting on cohesive-frictional soil, using the rigid plastic finite element method (RPFEM). In the numerical analysis, an interface element was introduced to properly evaluate the interaction between the footing base and the soil. The footing base was assumed to be rigid and rough, as it most often is in reality. Focus was placed on the effect of the soil properties (cohesive strength c, internal friction angle ϕ, and unit self-weight γ) and footing width B on the loading planes of the V-H-M limit load space (vertical load-horizontal load-moment) in order to consider the uniqueness of this limit load space. In particular, the effect of the two directions of the horizontal load, namely, positive and negative horizontal loads, on the V-H-M limit load space was clarified. The numerical results of the RPFEM showed that the negative horizontal load had a positive effect on supporting a higher bearing capacity than the positive horizontal load in the presence of a small eccentricity length. However, the results also showed a negligible effect on the bearing capacity for both directions of the horizontal load in the presence of a large eccentricity length. New equations were proposed to determine the V-H-M limit load space, predicted as functions of c/γB and ϕ, by taking into account the direction of the horizontal load. The applicability of the V-H-M limit load space was widely examined for several loading paths with different prescribed loads for V, H, and M. Consequently, the limit load space of the strip footing was clearly found to be unique for each value of c/γB and ϕ. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C-ϕ soil; Eccentric loading; Inclined loading; Strip footing; Ultimate bearing capacity","Bearing capacity; Friction; Geotechnical engineering; Loading; C-ϕ soil; Eccentric loading; Horizontal loads; Inclined loading; Inclined loads; Limit Load; Loadspace; Rigid plastic finite element method; Strip footing; Ultimate bearing capacity; Soils; bearing capacity; cohesive soil; footing; loading; soil-structure interaction","","","This work was supported by Funds for Science and Technology Development of the University of Danang under project number B2022-DN02-06, and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP 18H01533.","Asaoka, Akira, ANALYSIS OF FAILURE OF A NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY FOUNDATION UNDER EMBANKMENT LOADING., Soils and Foundations, 26, 2, pp. 47-59, (1986); Asaoka, Akira, BEARING CAPACITY ANALYSIS OF A NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY FOUNDATION., Soils and Foundations, 27, 3, pp. 58-70, (1987); Asaoka, Akira, Coupling analyses of limiting equilibrium state for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils, Soils and Foundations, 30, 3, pp. 109-123, (1990); Beygi, Majid, Finite element limit analysis of the seismic bearing capacity of strip footing adjacent to excavation in c-φ soil, Geomechanics and Geoengineering, 17, 1, pp. 246-259, (2022); Butterfield, Roy, A complete three-dimensional failure envelope for shallow footings on sand, Geotechnique, 44, 1, pp. 181-184, (1994); Butterfield, Roy, Standardized sign conventions and notation for generally loaded foundations, Geotechnique, 47, 5, pp. 1051-1054, (1997); Bearing capacity of strip footings, Developments in Geotechnical Engineering, 7, C, pp. 211-294, (1975); Chen, Yang, A CEL study of bearing capacity and failure mechanism of strip footing resting on c-φ soils, Computers and Geotechnics, 111, pp. 126-136, (2019); Cox, Alan D., Axially-symmetric plastic deformation in soils—II.

(1952). Oyo-Kontyu Tokyo, 8(1): 19–21), one of the dominant pests in major tea production areas in Asia, currently is known to occur in Japan, Vietnam, and China, and severely threatens tea production, quality, and international trade. To elucidate the population genetic structure of this species, 1633 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 18 microsatellite markers (SSRs) were used to genotype samples from 27 sites representing 18 geographical populations distributed throughout the known range of the species in East Asia. Analyses of both SNPs and SSRs showed that M. onukii populations in Yunnan exhibit high-genetic differentiation and structure compared with the other populations. The Kagoshima (JJ) and Shizuoka (JS) populations from Japan were separated from populations from China by SNPs, but clustered with populations from Jinhua (JH), Yingde (YD), Guilin (GL), Fuzhou (FZ), Hainan (HQ), Leshan (CT), Chongqing (CY), and Zunyi (ZY) tea plantations in China and the Vietnamese Vinh Phuc (VN) population based on the SSR data. In contrast, CT, CY, ZY, and Shaanxi (SX) populations clustered together based on SNPs, but were separated by SSRs. Both marker datasets identified significant geographic differentiation among the 18 populations. Various environmental and anthropogenic factors, including geographical barriers to migration, human transport of hosts (Camellia sinesis [L.] O. Kuntze) and adaptation of M. onukii to various local climatic zones possibly account for the rapid spread of this pest in Asia. The results demonstrate that SNPs from high-throughput genotyping data can be used to reveal subtle genetic substructure at broad scales in r-strategist insects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Matsumurasca onukii; reduced-representation genome sequencing; SNPs; SSRs; subtle genetic differentiation; tea pest","","","","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31270689), Quanzhou City Science and Technology Program of China (2018C040R), and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) (NCXS02.04/22‐23).","China Tea, (2014); Andrews, Kimberly R., Harnessing the power of RADseq for ecological and evolutionary genomics, Nature Reviews Genetics, 17, 2, pp. 81-92, (2016); Beerli, Peter, Comparison of Bayesian and maximum-likelihood inference of population genetic parameters, Bioinformatics, 22, 3, pp. 341-345, (2006); Bradbury, Peter J., TASSEL: Software for association mapping of complex traits in diverse samples, Bioinformatics, 23, 19, pp. 2633-2635, (2007); Campos, Melina, Microgeographical structure in the major Neotropical malaria vector Anopheles darlingi using microsatellites and SNP markers, Parasites and Vectors, 10, 1, pp. 1-8, (2017); Chapuis, Marie Pierre, Microsatellite null alleles and estimation of population differentiation, Molecular Biology and Evolution, 24, 3, pp. 621-631, (2007); China Tea, (2019); Southwest China J Agric Sci, (2015); Seed, (2009); China Tea, (2020)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","20457758","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141192546"

The calculated stability values from a 300-min stability test indicated that O/W-HA emulsions were more stable than O/W emulsions. Size distribution and Sauter mean diameter (D<inf>32</inf>) of oil droplets were calculated to evaluate the use of microbubbles (MB) in treating fine O/W-HA emulsions at different airflow rates, pH levels, and sodium chloride concentrations. At a prac-tical pressure (0.45 MPa), the designed column flotation system, featuring an F.BT-50 nozzle, produced a variety of gas bubbles to enhance separation.

Gr/DWCNTs film was first fabricated on copper foil and then modified with CuCl using thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, before being transferred onto gold screen printed electrode (AuE). An ad-layer polyalanine (PolyA) was introduced on the top of CuCl-Gr/DWCNTs hybrid film by direct electro-deposition from alanine monomer in order to facilitate immobilization of enzyme molecules. The as-prepared PolyA/CuCl-Gr/DWCNT film was finally used for developing Gly electrochemical sensor based on inhibition of Gly towards urease enzyme. The developed Gly sensor showed a high sensitivity of 1383 (μA.ppb−1.cm−2) and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.54 × 10−3 ppb in a wide concentration range of 10−3 ppb - 50 ppb. Moreover, the sensor was also applied to the detection of Gly in river water samples, with recoveries ranging from 112.8 % to 113.9 % (RSD: 1.54–2.03 %).

We show that in the case of the superlattice graphene Brillouin zone (SBZ) center folded into the primitive graphene Brillouin zone (GBZ) corner, the emergence of different replica Dirac cones and their scattering behaviors are driven by the substrate-induced potential or atomic-scale disorders as well as by the correlation between the rotation angle of the superlattice and the trigonal warping orientation of the Dirac cone because of the quantum interference associated with the scattering at the SBZ edge. In particular, a superlattice with a rotational angle of φ = 30° (G-N√3 × N√3-R30°, N > 1) facilitates intervalley scattering, whereas an unrotated superlattice (G-N3 × N3) is favorable to intravalley scattering. For a superlattice with a rotational angle in the range of 0 < φ < 30°, the intervalley and intravalley scatterings may be comparable to each other, leading to the emergence of mixed inequivalent replica cones at the SBZ center (or GBZ corner). Interestingly, such inequivalent replica cones facilitate a stronger intervalley scattering at the GBZ corner, compared to the G-N√3 × N√3-R30° and G-N3 × N3 superlattices, thus opening a larger energy gap at the primitive Dirac point. In addition to the inversion symmetry breaking in graphene, we show that intervalley scattering can also generate an energy gap at the secondary Dirac point. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Atoms; Density functional theory; Energy gap; A: semiconductors; Atomic scale; Brillouin zones; Dirac cones; Dirac point; Graphene superlattices; Intervalley scattering; Rotational angle; Semi-conductor surfaces; Short wavelengths; Graphene","","","Based on the research collaboration between the Center for Innovative Materials and Architectures (INOMAR, VNU-HCM) with Prof. Yoshiyuki Kawazoe (Tohoku University) and the Key Laboratory on Multiscale Simulation of Complex (MSCS, VNU-HN), the authors express their sincere thanks to Tohoku University and MSCS, VNU-HN, for their continuous support and help in using the MASAMUNE-IMR, CRAY-XC50 supercomputing facilities.

These soils cannot be reused directly cause of its weakness in strength properties. Hence, this study focuses on improving mechanical properties of waste soil by using cement and corn husk fiber. The environment has also benefited from using corn husk fiber since corn husk is agricultural by-product. In order to evaluate the impact of corn husk fiber and cement on mechanical characteristics of waste soil, a series of laboratory experiments containing tension and compression test is carried out. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test is conducted to investigate interaction between fibers and soil-cement matrix. Fiber content from 0 to 1% by dry soil mass and corn husk lengths of 10 and 30 mm are used in this research. The results present that strength properties of cemented soil are enhanced when fiber is added. The most improvements corresponding to compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and direct tensile strength are 30.6%, 206.1%, and 27.9%, respectively. A strong interaction between fibers and soil-cement matrix observed from SEM results in the improvement of strength properties of cemented soil. Fiber inclusion contributes to the more ductile and durable behavior under loading. Fiber length and fiber content have a remarkable effect on the cemented soil behavior.

In this paper, a PV array reconfiguration method is developed to minimize power losses of PV arrays under partial shading conditions. The proposed reconfiguration method is based on equalizing the reduction of the short-circuit current of the PV modules in the PV array. Eight state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network models are employed to estimate the effect of shading on the short-circuit current of a PV module. These models include LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG 11, VGG 19, Inception V3, ResNet 18, ResNet 34, and ResNet 50. Among eight models, the VGG 19 achieves the best accuracy on 1842 sample images. Therefore, this model is used to estimate the ratio of the actual short-circuit current and the estimated short-circuit current in four studied shading scenarios. This ratio decides the switching rule between PV modules throughout the PV array under PSC. A (Formula presented.) experimental PV array shows that the proposed reconfiguration method improves the output power from 5.81% to 25.19% in four shading patterns. Accordingly, the power losses are reduced from 1.32% to 13.75%. The power improvement and the reduction of power losses of the proposed dynamic PV array reconfiguration system under four case studies demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing the effects of PSC on the PV array. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; dynamic photovoltaic array reconfiguration; experimental analysis; image processing; partial shading conditions","Convolution; Image processing; Open circuit voltage; Photovoltaic effects; Solar panels; Timing circuits; Condition; Convolutional neural network; Dynamic photovoltaic array reconfiguration; Experimental analysis; Images processing; Partial shading; Partial shading condition; Photovoltaic arrays; Powerloss; Short-circuit currents; Short circuit currents","","","This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2020-SAHEP-005.","Snapshot of Global Pv Markets 2020, (2020); Shmilovitz, Doron, Distributed maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic systems-emerging architectures and control methods, Automatika, 53, 2, pp. 142-155, (2012); Malathy, S., Performance enhancement of partially shaded solar photovoltaic array using grouping technique, Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, 137, 3, (2015); Yang, Bo, PV arrays reconfiguration for partial shading mitigation: Recent advances, challenges and perspectives, Energy Conversion and Management, 247, (2021); Chavan, Vinaya Chandrakant, Effect of PV Array Positioning on Mismatch and Wiring Losses in Static Array Reconfiguration, IETE Journal of Research, 69, 7, pp. 4676-4689, (2023); Chavan, Vinaya Chandrakant, Hardware Implementation of Novel Shade Dispersion PV Reconfiguration Technique to Enhance Maximum Power under Partial Shading Conditions, Energies, 15, 10, (2022); Sai Krishna, Gundluru, Optimal SuDoKu Reconfiguration Technique for Total-Cross-Tied PV Array to Increase Power Output under Non-Uniform Irradiance, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 34, 4, pp. 1973-1984, (2019); Yadav, Karan Shishir, Mitigation of Mismatch Power Losses of PV Array under Partial Shading Condition using novel Odd Even Configuration, Energy Reports, 6, pp. 427-437, (2020); Mishra, Neha, Performance enhancement of PV system using proposed array topologies under various shadow patterns, Solar Energy, 157, pp. 641-656, (2017); Anjum, Shahroz, Modelling and simulation of AdDoKu based reconfiguration technique to harvest maximum power from photovoltaic array under partial shading conditions, Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 115, (2022)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137800689"

This study aims to determine the rate and associated factors of caesarean deliveries in urban areas of Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional study using questionnaire answered by women who had infants aged under 30 months was conducted from March to May 2021. Data were collected in 18 commune health centres in two cities during the day of routine immunization. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess factors associated with caesarean section. Results The overall caesarean section rate was 49.6%. The caesarean section rate in private hospitals (57.8%) were significantly higher than in public hospitals (49.1%). Caesarean section rate in first-time mothers (47.1%) were as high as this rate among mothers who had given birth before (50.6%). Factors associated with higher rate of caesarean section include increasing in women’s age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, and infant’s birth weight; first-time mothers; mothers living in urban areas; and mothers giving birth in private hospitals. Conclusions This study revealed a high rate of caesarean deliveries in urban areas of Vietnam.

In this study, concentrations and congener-specific profiles of PBDEs were determined in indoor dusts from industrial factories, offices, and houses in northern Vietnam. Levels of Σ8PBDEs were higher in the office dusts (median 270; range 230–300 ng/g) and factory dusts (170; 89–510 ng/g) than in the house dusts (61; 25–140 ng/g). BDE-209 was the most dominant congener, accounting for 27–98% (average 62%) of Σ8PBDEs, suggesting the abundance of products treated with deca-BDE mixtures. Residential, commercial, and industrial activities in the studied locations of this survey were not significant sources of PBDEs as compared to those of informal waste processing activities in Vietnam. Relatively low PBDE concentrations detected in our dust samples partially reflect effectiveness of the global PBDE phase-out. Human exposure and health risk associated with dust-bound PBDEs were estimated, indicating acceptable levels of risk (i.e., neurobehavioral effects). The contributions of workplace dusts in total daily intake doses of PBDEs via dust ingestion were more important for local workers in informal recycling areas than factory workers and general population, raising the need of appropriate labor protection measures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emission sources; Human exposure; Indoor dust; Northern Vietnam; PBDEs","dust; ether; health risk; PBDE; pollution exposure; recycling; workplace; Viet Nam; diphenyl ether derivative; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; industry; Air Pollution, Indoor; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities; Vietnam","","Dust; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers","This study was supported by Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (Grant code: QTAT01.01/19–20) and Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research (Fostering Joint International Research (B)) (18KK0300) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).","Abbasi, Golnoush, Global Historical Stocks and Emissions of PBDEs, Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 11, pp. 6330-6340, (2019); Alaee, Mehran, An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release, Environment International, 29, 6, pp. 683-689, (2003); Al-Omran, Layla Salih, Polybrominated diphenyl ethers and “novel” brominated flame retardants in floor and elevated surface house dust from Iraq: Implications for human exposure assessment, Emerging Contaminants, 2, 1, pp. 7-13, (2016); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in plastic products, indoor dust, sediment and fish from informal e-waste recycling sites in Vietnam: a comprehensive assessment of contamination, accumulation pattern, emissions, and human exposure, Environmental Geochemistry and Health, 39, 4, pp. 935-954, (2017); Hoang, Anhquoc, PBDEs and novel brominated flame retardants in road dust from northern Vietnam: Levels, congener profiles, emission sources and implications for human exposure, Chemosphere, 197, pp. 389-398, (2018); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their methylated derivatives in settled dusts from end-of-life vehicle processing, urban, and rural areas, northern Vietnam: Occurrence, source apportionment, and risk assessment, Science of the Total Environment, 672, pp. 468-478, (2019); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polyurethane foam-based passive air sampling for simultaneous determination of POP- and PAH-related compounds: A case study in informal waste processing and urban areas, northern Vietnam, Chemosphere, 247, (2020); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polychlorinated biphenyls in settled dusts from an end-of-life vehicle processing area and normal house dusts in northern Vietnam: Occurrence, potential sources, and risk assessment, Science of the Total Environment, 728, (2020); Besis, Athanasios, Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the indoor and outdoor environments - A review on occurrence and human exposure, Environmental Pollution, 169, pp. 217-229, (2012); Chou, Huiming, Levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in air-conditioner filter dust used to assess health risks in clinic and electronic plant employees, Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 16, 1, pp. 184-194, (2016)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15732983; 02694042","","","34196882","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132292642"

Therefore, a selected quenching medium should have a cooling rate equal to or greater than the critical cooling rate of the steel to achieve high hardness values, but the cooling rate should not be too large in order to minimize stress and distortion on the specimen. This paper studied the hardness, stress and distortion of C-ring samples quenched in 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-K60 solution and oil using simulated and experimental measurements. The results show that the maximum cooling rates (CR<inf>max</inf>) of oil and 4% PVP-K60 quenchants are both higher than the critical cooling rate of steel. The CR<inf>max</inf> of the 4% PVP-K60 solution is greater than that of the oil, and the cooling rate of the 4% PVP-K60 solution at 300 °C (CR<inf>300</inf>) is smaller than that of the oil. The greater the CR<inf>300</inf> is, the greater the hardness, stress and distortion are. Thus, the hardness, stress and distortion values of the quenched sample depend less on CR<inf>max</inf> and more on CR<inf>300.</inf> The research results also showed that a solution of 4% PVP-K60 could replace oil in the quenching of 100Cr6 steel. Simulated and experimental results of the hardness, stress and distortion of C-ring samples reflected the same rule. The errors between the simulation and experiment using the program and the computational conditions of distortion are approximately 20%.

Currently, the molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxicity of Cas and its host selectivity have not been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed the binding of Cas1 and Cas2 to membranes consisting of different plant lipids and their membrane disruption activities. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy and confocal microscopy, we reveal that the binding and disruption activities of Cas1 and Cas2 on lipid membranes are strongly dependent on the specific plant lipids. The negative phospholipids, glycerolipids, and sterols are more sensitive to membrane damage caused by Cas1 and Cas2 than neutral phospholipids and betaine lipids. Mature Cas1 and Cas2 play an essential role in causing membrane disruption. Cytotoxicity tests on rubber leaves of Rubber Research Institute of Vietnam (RRIV) 1, RRIV 4, and Prang Besar (PB) 255 clones suggest that the toxins cause necrosis of rubber leaves, except for the strong resistance of PB 255 against Cas2. Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy analyses of necrotic leaf tissues treated with Cas1 confirm that cytoplasmic membranes are vulnerable to the toxin. Thus, the host selectivity of Cas toxin is attained by the lipid-dependent binding activity of Cas to the membrane, and the cytotoxicity of Cas arises from its ability to form biofilm-like structures and to disrupt specific membranes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","disease resistance; diseases in natural plant populations; fungal pathogens; mycotoxins; pathogen effectors; pathogen recognition by plants; plant immune responses; population biology; postharvest pathology","CRISPR associated protein; lipid; rubber; Hevea; metabolism; plant disease; plant leaf; CRISPR-Associated Proteins; Lipids; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Rubber","","lipid, 66455-18-3; rubber, 9006-04-6; CRISPR-Associated Proteins; Lipids; Rubber","Funding text 1: We thank Toshio Ando (WPI-NanoLSI, Kanazawa University) for HS-AFM supports and critical reading and comments; Taro Q.

The cyclic shear tests were run for relatively wide range of shear strain amplitude (γ = 0.05%-2%), different cycle numbers (n = 10, 50, 150 and 200) and various shear directions (uni-direction and two-direction with phase difference of θ = 0°, 45° and 90°). It is indicated from the experimental results that under the same cyclic shearing condition, the pore water pressure accumulation in Hue clay is at a slower rate, suggesting a higher cyclic shear resistance of Hue clay than that of Nam O sand. Liquefaction is reached easily in nominally 50% relative density specimens of Nam O sand when γ ≥ 0.4%, meanwhile soft specimen of Hue clay is not liquefied regardless of the cyclic shearing conditions used in this study. The threshold number of cycles for the pore water pressure generation generally decreases with γ meanwhile, the threshold cumulative shear strain for such a property mostly approaches 0.1%. In addition, by using this new strain path parameter, it becomes more advantageous when evaluating the pore water pressure accumulation in Nam O sand and Hue clay subjected to undrained uni-directional and two-directional cyclic shears. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyclic shear; effective stress; Hue clay; Nam O sand; pore water pressure","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant Number 105.08-2018.01 and by Hue University under the Core Research Program, Grant No. NCM.DHH.2018.03.

Compared with the control, the STB reactor enhanced the reduction of persistent organics by 11% based on the double exponential decay model. Besides, the removal of NH<inf>4</inf>+-N is 26% higher, satisfying the first-order decay model. The nitrification was inhibited entirely in control during 48 h, whilst the assimilation process involved 55% of total nitrogen removal. In the STB reactor, nitrification occurred after 12 h, resulting in significantly increased NO<inf>2</inf>–-N and NO<inf>3</inf>–-N concentrations according to the logistic function. Although nitrification was successfully activated, C/N ratios and free ammonia were identified as limiting factors for STB activity, requiring mitigation strategies in further studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Double exponential decay model; First-order decay model; Logistic regression; Membrane bioreactor; Nitrification; Salt-tolerant bacteria","Ammonia; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Decay (organic); Degradation; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Decay model; Degradation kinetics; Double exponential; Double exponential decay model; Exponential decay models; First-order decay model; First-order decays; Salt tolerant; Salt-tolerant bacteria; Tannery wastewater treatment; Bioreactors; nitrogen; phosphorus derivative; ammonia; nitrite; biodegradation; bioreactor; comparative advantage; comparative study; membrane; microbial activity; microbial community; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; wastewater treatment; Article; biodegradability; biomass; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; degradation kinetics; denitrification; disaster mitigation; growth rate; heterotrophy; leather industry; municipal solid waste; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; Nitrobacter; Nitrosomonas; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; physical chemistry; pollutant; salt tolerance; suspended particulate matter; tannery wastewater; waste water management; kinetics; nonlinear system; wastewater; water management; Kinetics; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Nonlinear Dynamics; Waste Water; Water Purification","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrite, 14797-65-0; Ammonia; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Waste Water","We acknowledge the support of time and facilities from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM for this study.

The joint uses perfobond strips along with steel fiber-reinforced mortars, which is expected to be smaller and to offer a short construction time compared with traditional loop joints. Firstly, an optimized mixture of the steel fiber-reinforced mortar with both early strength development and high tensile strength is developed based on material tests. Then, eight joint specimens are fabricated and tested under flexural loads, considering the effects of various parameters associated with the layout, the perforation diameter of perfobond strips, and the curing age of joint materials. Detail discussions on load–deflection relationships, crack patterns, strain behaviors of joint components, and joint resisting mechanisms are presented. It is observed that the flexural behavior of the joint is correlated with the shear behavior of the perfobond strips, which is both significantly affected by the examined parameters. Finally, a simplified estimating method for the joint flexural capacity is then proposed according to the shear capacity of perfobond strips. The results obtained by the proposed method show a good agreement with ones from the experimental results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexural loading test, flexural behavior; Perfobond strips; Precast concrete slab joint; Steel fiber-reinforced mortar","","","","This work was supported by The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology, code number of Project: T2021-02-48.

In addition, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during chemotherapy induces drug resistance and severe intestinal side effects. In this study, silica-installed ROS scavenging nanoparticles (siRNP) with 50–60 nm in diameter were employed to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of CPT. The solubility of CPT was significantly improved by incorporating it into the core of the nanoparticle, forming CPT-loaded siRNP (CPT@siRNP). The anticancer activity of CPT@siRNP against colorectal cancer cells (C-26) in vitro was significantly improved as compared to free CPT through higher efficiency of intracellular internalization and induction of apoptosis. Owing to its antioxidant properties, CPT@siRNP reduced cytotoxicity to normal endothelial cells, which was in sharp contrast to the high toxicity of free CPT. Oral administration of CPT and CPT@siRNP to the C-26 tumor-bearing mice exhibited antitumor activity, accompanied by effective suppression of tumor growth. Although CPT treatment suppressed tumor progression, it caused severe side effects, including intestinal damage and significant bodyweight loss. Interestingly, such noticeable side effects were not observed in the mice treated with CPT@siRNP, and the effect of tumor growth inhibition tended to be similar to or higher than that of CPT treatment. The results obtained in this study indicate that CPT@siRNP is a potential therapeutic nanomedicine for the treatment of colon cancer. Statement of significance: Here we employed silica-containing antioxidant nanoparticle (siRNP) as promising oral delivery nanocarrier of campothecin (CPT) to treat colon cancer. The design of siRNP via covalent conjugation of antioxidant nitroxide radicals and the silanol groups in the polymer backbone contributes to a significant increase in the absorption of hydrophobic drug molecules inside the core and enhances the stability of nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal environment for oral drug delivery. CPT-loaded siRNP (CPT@siRNP) significantly improved solubility of CPT. As compared to free CTP, the CPT@siRNP treatment showed a significantly higher toxicity to colon cancer cell, inhibition of cancer cell migration, and induction of apopotosis.

It has also been employed as a proof-of-work algorithm in blockchain implementations. Although this cryptographic hash function provides very high security, the processing speed and power consumption to generate a hashed block for the blockchain network are low-performance. In this paper, a high-speed and low-power hardware architecture of the Scrypt function is proposed to generate blocks for the Scrypt-based blockchain network. This architecture minimizes the number of main computational blocks to reduce the power consumption of the system. In addition, the proposed sharing resources and pipelined architectures make the calculation speed increase significantly while the hardware cost is reduced by half compared to the parallel non-pipelined architecture. The full hardware system is designed and implemented on Xilinx Virtex-7 and Aveo U280 FPGA platforms. The hash rate of the proposed system reaches 229.1 kHash/s. Its hash rate, hardware and energy efficiencies are much higher than those of the other works implemented on FPGA and GPU hardware platforms. The proposed hardware architecture is also successfully implemented in an ASIC design using ROHM 180 nm CMOS technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; PBKDF2; Salsa20; Scrypt hash algorithm; SHA-256 algorithm","","","","Funding: This research is funded by Vietnam National University, HoChiMinh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number DSC2021-26-01.","Leible, Stephan, A Review on Blockchain Technology and Blockchain Projects Fostering Open Science, Frontiers in Blockchain, 2, (2019); Kshetri, Nir, Blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy, Telecommunications Policy, 41, 10, pp. 1027-1038, (2017); Zhai, Sheping, Research on the Application of Cryptography on the Blockchain, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1168, 3, (2019); Fu, Jinhua, A Study on the Optimization of Blockchain Hashing Algorithm Based on PRCA, Security and Communication Networks, 2020, (2020); Wang, Licheng, Cryptographic primitives in blockchains, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 127, pp. 43-58, (2019); Martino, Raffaele, Designing a SHA-256 processor for blockchain-based IoT applications, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 11, (2020); Martino, Raffaele, A Flexible Framework for Exploring, Evaluating, and Comparing SHA-2 Designs, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 72443-72456, (2019); Wiemer, Friedrich, High-speed implementation of bcrypt password search using special-purpose hardware, (2014); Proceedings of the International Conference on Wireless Networks ICWN, (2016); Hatzivasilis, George, Password-hashing status, Cryptography, 1, 2, pp. 1-31, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127079507"

This study aims to investigate the plugging performance of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media through a series of sandpack experiments. First of all, CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluids were generated by stirring CO<inf>2</inf> gas diffused into polymer (Xanthan gum (XG)) and surfactant (Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) solution with different gas: liquid ratios. Then, CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles fluids were injected into single-core and dual-core sandpack systems. The results show that the rheological behaviors of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluids in this study were followed the Power-law model at room temperature. The apparent viscosity of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid increased as the gas: liquid ratio increased. CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles could block pore throat due to the “Jamin effect” and increase the resistance in porous media. The blocking ability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles reached an optimal value at the gas:liquid ratio of 20% in the homogeneous porous media. Moreover, the selective pugging ability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in dual-core sandpack tests was significant. CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles exhibited a good flow control profile in the high permeability region and flexibility to flow over the pore constrictions in the low permeability region, leading to an ultimate fractional flow proportion (50%:50%) in the dual-core sandpack model with a permeability differential of 1.0:2.0 darcy. The fractional flow ratio was considerable compared with a polymer injection. At the higher heterogeneity of porous media (0.5:2.0 darcy), CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid could still establish a good swept performance.

The large steel pile, which was equivalent to real structures, was placed in all environmental zones to evaluate the overall corrosive effects of the brackish water. After 5 years, the corrosion rate over the entire length of the steel pile was measured and the rust at the boundary altitude between the zones was characterized. The corrosion rate profile shows the polarization of the entire pile length into two large anodic areas at the highest water level and submerged zones, where had high corrosion rate and pitting corrosion form. X-ray diffraction and metallographic of rust layers showed that Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> phase increased with water depth, allowing to strong diffusion of Fe2+ ion from steel substrate into the environment. The change in organism populations along water altitude in the tidal and submerged zones made the rust layers more complicated. Such distribution of polarized electrodes and composition of rust were due to the renewal of the corrosive agent by tidal cycles and organism population in water. As a result, the steel substrate in the tidal and mud zones was protected as cathodic areas.

However, alkali-silica reaction (ASR) will be a serious problem when the recycled glass is used as concrete aggregates. This paper shows an investigation of the alkali-silica reaction of glass sand mortar under steam curing. The test for ASR expansion follows ASTM C1567. Type F fly ash (FA) is used together with Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mixing with mixed color glass sand. FA contents are of 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% as OPC replacement. Steam curing accelerating FA reaction is used to contribute to the mitigation of ASR by strength improvement of the mortar. Under steam curing, the results show that the recommended contents of FA to use are of 20% to 30% to ensure expansion lower than the threshold of ASTM. Moreover, steam curing increases the expansion of the glass sand mortar in compared to the moist curing, and expansion crack appears at the interface between glass sand and cementitious matrix, not in the glass sand. In comparison with glass sand mortar under moist curing, expansion of glass sand mortar using fly ash under steam curing is contributed primarily by: (1) delayed ettringite formation, (2) reducing ion transportation, (3) increasing tensile strength of fly ash glass sand mortar and (4) reducing glass sand dissolution rate in rich alkalinity solution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","alkali-silica reaction; fly ash; Recycled glass aggregate; steam curing","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for supporting this research through the CRC 2016 project of the AUN/SEED-Net Program.

In this study, the evolution of the char characteristics throughout the gasification process was deeply investigated. The low ash content, high heating value, and fast char conversion rate highlighted the suitability of bagasse for gasification. The char morphology underwent significant changes with rupture of beehive-like structures that make up the char when conversion X [0, 1] is higher than 0.5. On the contrary, changes in carbon structures were observed more clearly at the beginning of char conversion (X < 0.5). The gasified chars had high porosity made of micro-mesoporous structures, and the maximum value of total specific surface area (S<inf>BET</inf> = 877 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (V<inf>BET</inf> = 0.49 cm3 g−1) were observed at X = 0.75. The high values of S<inf>BET</inf> and V<inf>BET</inf> - even when gasification is nearing its end - highlighted the potential of using residues after gasification as an alternative to expensive commercial activated carbons.

The behavior of crack such as jump of displacement field across crack surface is mathematically captured by enriched functions, which are selected based on asymptotic solution. For meshless numerical integration, the NURBS-enhanced Cartesian transformation method is proposed to evaluate domain integrals of geometries with curved boundaries, without the need for sub-division of problem domain into background cells. It is guaranteed that no discontinuity is located within integration domain, as crack surfaces are viewed as part of the boundaries. Thanks to the Kronecker's delta property of the moving Kriging interpolation, direct imposition of boundary conditions can thus be made. The correlation parameter, which has certain effects on the accuracy of approximation, is not necessary to be pre-defined in this work. Instead, it is determined according to the characteristic nodal distance in every support domain. The accuracy and efficiency of the present approach are investigated in various examples and computed results are compared with available analytical solutions and/or other numerical methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fracture mechanics; Hyper-elasticity; Large deformation; Meshfree analysis; Moving Kriging","Cracks; Deformation; Elasticity; Fracture mechanics; Numerical methods; Cartesian transformations; Crack surfaces; Fractures mechanics; Hyper elastic; Hyper-elasticity; Larger deformations; Meshfree analysis; Meshfree modeling; Moving kriging; Transformation methods; Kriging","","","Funding text 1: This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 107.02-2019.327 .

The presence of these glands has been confirmed in only 6 of 22 hornet species (genus Vespa) and images of their fine structure have not been produced. Here; we characterize the external morphology associated with both glands for workers of nine Vespa species using scanning electron microscopy. All hornets had similar gland configurations; although gland-associated external features differed among species. Scaled for size, glands were equivalently sized for the giant hornets (V. mandarinia and V. soror) and their closest phylogenetic relatives (V. tropica and V. ducalis). Relative size of gland-associated structures was reduced by half for V. simillima; V. velutina; and V. affinis workers.

The proposed system detects nearby pedestrians using range sensors, informs the rider about the invasion of the vehicle via a micro-vibration motor, and cooperates with the rider in avoiding the pedestrian. The experiment was conducted under different conditions of pedestrian densities, and questionnaires were used to evaluate participants' feelings such as discomfort and fear.

Community-based ecotourism (CBET) has specific benefits closely related to the sustainability of natural ecosystems and community development. CBET can be defined as nature-based tourism, helping shape the types of tourism services, planning and developing destinations provided by communities directly. CBET is supposed to be a sustainable alternative to mass tourism by its potential benefits in Vietnam. The study aims to evaluate the sustainability of four CBET destinations in Central Vietnam through a sustainable ecotourism index (SEI) formed by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Based on the literature review, local people, and experts’ recommendations, a set of fourteen criteria categorized into five groups reflecting the critical attributes of the sustainable CBET that include environmental conservation, economic benefits, community participation, cultural preservation, and empowerment are analyzed. The raw data is obtained from in-depth interviews with 21 experts and 42 households. After normalizing, the results indicate that out of four CBET destinations, one is identified as high sustainability (SEI>4.2), two are neutral (3.4<SEI<4.2), and one is lower than (SEI<3.4). These findings provide implications for extending the AHP theory in tourism and policy implications toward sustainable development in future tourism. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Central Vietnam; Community-based ecotourism; sustainable ecotourism index (SEI)","","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the ?sia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (?PN) through project CB?2019-02MY-Hoang.

Our aim was to compare the efficacies of two meiotic inhibitors, dibutyryl-cAMP and roscovitine for the meiosis synchronization during in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes vitrified at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. We first compared the efficacy of 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP and 25 μM roscovitine on meiotic arrest during the first 22 h of IVM. Dibutyryl-cAMP could maintain the GV stage in 83.5% of oocytes; however, roscovitine was even more effective (96.6%), whereas only 17.4% of the oocytes remained at the GV stage without these additives. Temporal meiotic arrest for 22 h by roscovitine did not reduce the percentage of oocytes reaching the Metaphase II stage during subsequent IVM. However, after parthenogenetic stimulation or in vitro fertilization, subsequent embryo development to the blastocyst stage was compromised after roscovitine treatment, whereas dibutyryl-cAMP improved the percentage of blastocyst development. In conclusion, dibutyryl-cAMP could derogate but not completely prevent premature meiosis in vitrified oocytes, whereas roscovitine could more efficiently prevent it. However, for embryo production, the use of roscovitine was disadvantageous, whereas the use of dibutyryl-cAMP was beneficial. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dbcAMP; embryonic development; porcine oocyte; roscovitine; vitrification","roscovitine; animal; embryo development; in vitro fertilization; meiosis; oocyte; physiology; pig; veterinary medicine; vitrification; Animals; Embryonic Development; Fertilization in Vitro; Meiosis; Oocytes; Roscovitine; Swine; Vitrification","","roscovitine, 186692-46-6; Roscovitine","We thank Ms. Mitsuru Nagai, for technical assistance.

Throughout the regime where the model yields a locally-finite graph, (i.e. for s > d,) we determine the spectral dimension of the associated simple random walk, apart from at the exceptional value d = 1, s = 2, where the spectral dimension is discontinuous. Towards this end, we present various on-diagonal heat kernel bounds, a number of which are new. In particular, the lower bounds are derived through the application of a general technique that utilises the translation invariance of the model. We highlight that, applying this general technique, we are able to partially extend our main result beyond the nearest-neighbour setting, and establish lower heat kernel bounds over the range of parameters s ∈ (d, 2d). We further note that our approach is applicable to short-range models as well. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","heat kernel estimates; long-range percolation; random walk; spectral dimension","","","","*This research was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI, grant numbers 17F17319, 17H01093 and 19K03540, by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 grant number MOE2018-T2-2-076, by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology grant number CTTH00.02/22-23, and by the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, an International Joint Usage/Research Center located in Kyoto University. \u2020Institute of Mathematics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Cau Giay, Hanoi, Vietnam. \u2021Department of Statistics and Data Science, National University of Singapore, 6 Science Drive 2 Singapore 117546.

In this study we describe siblings suffering from classical Cockayne syndrome but without photosensitivity, which delayed a clinical diagnosis for 16 years. By whole-exome sequencing we identified the two novel compound heterozygous ERCC8 variants c.370_371del (p.L124Efs*15) and c.484G>C (p.G162R). The causality of the ERCC8 variants, of which one results in a frameshift and the other affects the WD3 domain, was tested and confirmed by a rescue experiment investigating DNA repair in H2O2 treated patient fibroblasts. Structural modeling of the p.G162R variant indicates effects on protein-protein interaction. This case shows the importance to test for ERCC6 and ERCC8 variants even if patients do not present with a complete CS phenotype. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cockayne syndrome; DNA excision repair; ERCC8; segmental progeroid disease","DNA ligase; ERCC8 protein, human; hydrogen peroxide; transcription factor; Asian; Cockayne syndrome; DNA repair; genetics; human; phenotype; sibling; Asians; Cockayne Syndrome; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Enzymes; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Phenotype; Siblings; Transcription Factors","","DNA ligase, 9015-85-4; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; DNA Repair Enzymes; ERCC8 protein, human; Hydrogen Peroxide; Transcription Factors","This study was funded by a grant from Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under grant number NVCC40.01/20-20.

This paper proposed a fog computing enabled hydroponic farming framework that devises low-cost data collection and novel data analysis mechanisms to deliver intelligent farming systems. In this framework, the data from multiple IoT sensors at the garden are collected, filtered and analyzed by artificial neural network (ANN) models deployed at the fog landscapes, while the ANN models are trained in the cloud with a large amount of historical farming data. This approach allows the intelligent models being updated, reducing the communication cost and response time, while utilizing computing resources available on the network edge.

Three reactors were set up with internal recirculation ratio of 1 (IR = 1) and similar media surface area. Bio-sponge and bio-cloth reactors showed removal of COD (79 vs. 76%) and NH<inf>4</inf>+–N (78 vs. 73%). While bio-cord treatment was deteriorated due to time-dependent process. Multiple linear regression revealed that alkalinity governed the formation degree of the anaerobic zone in bio-sponges, partially affecting nitrification. Increasing IR from 1 to 3 caused sloughing of the attached biomass and was positively correlated with effluent nitrite nitrogen concentration, indicating the sensitivity of nitrification to spatial distribution effects. In addition, bio-sponge system obtained superior performance at IR of 2 while bio-cloth one might be also an effective media for wastewater treatment if having good durability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attached growth; Domestic wastewater; Down-flow hanging media; Multiple linear regression; Nitrite accumulation","Effluents; Linear regression; Nitrification; Wastewater treatment; Attached growth; Domestic waste water treatment; Domestic wastewater; Down flows; Down-flow hanging medium; Growth process; Internal recirculations; Media types; Nitrite accumulation; Recirculation ratio; Multiple linear regression; ammonia; nitrite; nitrogen; alkalinity; biomass; effluent; growth; nitrification; recirculating system; spatial distribution; wastewater treatment; Article; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; nitrogen concentration; waste water management; bioreactor; sewage; wastewater; Porifera; Bioreactors; Nitrogen; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water","","ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrite, 14797-65-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen; Waste Water","The authors would like to thank for IJL “LECZ-CARE” project for supporting the Equipment for laboratory analysis.

To achieve high rates of recycling, citizens are encouraged to participate in waste separation at home. Behavior prediction has been used to understand the factors that promote participation in recycling activities. This study focused on predictive models of waste separation behavior and their application in estimating the effect of promotion measures on behavior. Data were collected from 600 households in Da Nang, Vietnam. Logistic regression was used to develop predictive models of separation behavior for 14 recyclable categories. Sensitivity analyses of the models were carried out to predict changes in participation rates and waste amount caused by the implementation of various promotion measures. Provision of information was the most effective promotion measure, with the highest predicted increase in recycling participation rates (6.1−49.0%) and the amount of separated recyclables (up to 9.6% of total waste generated), followed by provision of collection services, with a predicted increase of 1.6−7.7% in participation rates and 7.7% in the amount of separated recyclables. For further improvement, promotion of environmental awareness should be considered.

This island is located off the coast of southern Vietnam. In addition, we discussed the phylogenetic relationships among C. finlaysonii subspecies distributed on the isolated islands in the Gulf of Thailand. The new subspecies (C. finlaysonii honnghensis), which is endemic to Hon Nghe Island, differs from other C. finlaysonii subspecies in pelage colouration. The mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences showed that this squirrel is closely related to C. finlaysonii albivexilli and C. finlaysonii frandseni, which are endemic to the Koh Kut and Koh Chang islands, respectively, suggesting that the three subspecies diverged approximately 30,000 years ago. After the last glacial maximum, many small islands were formed by the sea level rise in the Gulf of Thailand, which was a consequence of global warming. Following the continuous fragmentation of the Sunda Continent, each C. finlaysonii subspecies could have evolved in each geographically isolated island in this gulf. Thus, studying C. finlaysonii subspecies may be used to track the recent geological history of the Gulf of Thailand. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Callosciurus finlaysonii; cytochrome b; geographical isolation; Gulf of Thailand; Hon Nghe Island","fragmentation; geographical distribution; habitat fragmentation; island; Last Glacial Maximum; new species; phylogenetics; rodent; subspecies; Gulf of Thailand; Indochina; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Viet Nam","","","Research funding: This research was funded by The Program of Developing Basic Sciences in Chemistry, Life Sciences, Earth Sciences and Marine Sciences, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (KHCBSS.02/20\u201322), as well as partially supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research nos. 18H03602, 19H00534 and 20H01979 from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture, Japan and Idea Wild Grant.

Several examples are performed to point out the effectiveness of the proposed method on simplifying the cutting pattern process and the reduction in the stress deviation from the intended pre-stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ALE formulations; Chinese hat type; cone type; cutting pattern; HP type","Membrane structures; 3d configurations; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulations; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method; Cutting patterns; Eulerian; Lagrangian; Tensile membrane structures; Threedimensional (3-d); Lagrange multipliers","","","This research is funded by Funds for Science and Technology Development of the University of Danang under project number B2019-DN02-69.","Bletzinger, Kai Uwe, Variation of Reference Strategy - A Novel Approach for Generating Optimized Cutting Patterns of Membrane Structures, Procedia Engineering, 155, pp. 131-141, (2016); Brew, John S., Spline-based and stress-monitored patterning of fabric structures, Computers and Structures, 119, pp. 203-214, (2013); Cívalek, Ömer, Eigenvalues of membranes having skew and rhombic geometry using discrete singular convolution algorithm, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 14, 11, pp. 4003-4009, (2009); Ersoy, Hakan, Free vibration of circular and annular membranes with varying density by the method of discrete singular convolution, Structural Engineering and Mechanics, 32, 5, pp. 621-634, (2009); Gale, Stuart, Patterning of tensile fabric structures with a discrete element model using dynamic relaxation, Computers and Structures, 169, pp. 112-121, (2016); Haber, Robert Bruce, Contact-slip analysis using mixed displacements, Journal of Engineering Mechanics - ASCE, 109, 2, pp. 411-429, (1983); Hughes, Thomas J.R., Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element formulation for incompressible viscous flows, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 29, 3, pp. 329-349, (1981); Ishii, Kazuo, Form finding analysis in consideration of cutting patterns of membrane structures, International Journal of Space Structures, 14, 2, pp. 105-119, (1999); Kim, Jae-yeol, A new technique for optimum cutting pattern generation of membrane structures, Engineering Structures, 24, 6, pp. 745-756, (2002); Linhard, Johannes, Introducing cutting patterns in form finding and structural analysis, Computational Methods in Applied Sciences, 8, pp. 69-84, (2008)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13472852; 13467581","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095740272"

Recently, the operated Sentinel-2 MSI satellite offers high spatial resolution images for remote water quality monitoring. In this study, we tested the performance of the three well-known machine learning (ML) (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and Gaussian process [GP]) and the two novel ML (extreme gradient boost (XGB) and CatBoost [CB]) models for estimation a wide range of Chl-a concentration (10.1–798.7 μg/L) using the Sentinel-2 MSI data and in situ water quality measurement in the Tri An Reservoir (TAR), Vietnam. GP indicated the most reliable model for predicting Chl-a from water quality parameters (R2 = 0.85, root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 56.65 μg/L, Akaike's information criterion [AIC] = 575.10, and Bayesian information criterion [BIC] = 595.24). Regarding input model as water surface reflectance, CB was the superior model for Chl-a retrieval (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 46.28 μg/L, AIC = 229.18, and BIC = 238.50). Our results indicated that GP and CB are the two best models for the prediction of Chl-a in TAR. Overall, the Sentinel-2 MSI coupled with ML algorithms is a reliable, inexpensive, and accurate instrument for monitoring Chl-a in inland waters. Practitioner points: Machine learning algorithms were used for both remote sensing data and in situ water quality measurements. The performance of five well-known machine learning models was tested Gaussian process was the most reliable model for predicting Chl-a from water quality parameters CatBoost was the best model for Chl-a retrieval from water surface reflectance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CatBoost; Gaussian process; machine learning; remote sensing; Sentinel-2 MSI","Chlorophyll; Decision trees; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Reflection; Reservoirs (water); Support vector machines; Water quality; Catboost; Chlorophyll a; Gaussian Processes; Inland waters; Machine learning algorithms; Performance; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2 MSI; Viet Nam; Water quality measurement; Remote sensing; chlorophyll a; surface water; chlorophyll; algorithm; comparative study; in situ measurement; machine learning; performance assessment; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; support vector machine; water quality; air temperature; Article; atmosphere; controlled study; kernel method; Microcystis; radial basis function; random forest; water depth; water temperature; wind speed; Bayes theorem; environmental monitoring; Tri An Reservoir; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Chlorophyll A; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Vietnam","","chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A","This study was funded by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under grant number “KHCBSS.02/19‐21”.","Ansper, Ave, Retrieval of chlorophyll a from Sentinel-2 MSI data for the European Union water framework directive reporting purposes, Remote Sensing, 11, 1, (2019); Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (2025); Barzegar, Rahim, Short-term water quality variable prediction using a hybrid CNN–LSTM deep learning model, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 34, 2, pp. 415-433, (2020); Bazi, Yakoub, Robust estimation of water chlorophyll concentrations with Gaussian process regression and IOWA aggregation operators, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 7, pp. 3019-3028, (2014); Belgiu, Mariana, Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 114, pp. 24-31, (2016); Blix, Katalin, Gaussian Process Sensitivity Analysis for Oceanic Chlorophyll Estimation, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 10, 4, pp. 1265-1277, (2017); Blix, Katalin, Machine learning automatic model selection algorithm for oceanic chlorophyll-a content retrieval, Remote Sensing, 10, 5, (2018); Blix, Katalin, Developing a new machine-learning algorithm for estimating Chlorophyll-a concentration in optically complex waters: A case study for high northern latitude waters by using Sentinel 3 OLCI, Remote Sensing, 11, 18, (2019); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Bui, Ha Manh, Prediction of cyanobacterial blooms in the Dau Tieng Reservoir using an artificial neural network, Marine and Freshwater Research, 68, 11, pp. 2070-2080, (2017)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","10614303; 15547531","","WAERE","34547152","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116322440"

The domain problem is discretized using the meshfree particle radial point interpolation method (RPIM), which inherently possesses the Kronecker's delta property. Meshless numerical integration is evaluated by the Cartesian transformation method (CTM), which enhances the performance of the RPIM. In addition, we also introduce a new approach to further improve the capability of the current CTM in evaluation of numerical integration for problems with complex geometries, i.e., by incorporation of the non-uniform rational B-splines function (NURBS) into the CTM. The emphasis of the paper is on the nonlinear nature of the large deformation problems, which are often solved by an iterative scheme. Conventional Newton–Raphson technique usually requires high cost due to the fact that several load steps are usually performed, and multiple iterations are needed in each load step. This low computational efficiency can be overcome, as proposed in this work, by using the so-called combined approximation, which approximates the full-size solution by a set of reduced bases. In other words, reduction of the problem size can be obtained, leading to reduction of the computational time, while accuracy is almost preserved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined approximation; Computational efficiency; Large deformation; Meshfree; Reduced basis; RPIM","Deformation; Efficiency; Interpolation; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Particle size analysis; Rational functions; % reductions; Cartesian transformations; Combined approximations; Large deformation analysis; Larger deformations; Meshfree; Numerical integrations; Radial point interpolation method; Reduced basis; Transformation methods; Computational efficiency","","","Funding text 1: This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 107.02-2019.327 .

We have previously established a tumor spheroid-based assay that used gadolinium containing mesoporous silica nanoparticles and synchrotron-generated monochromatic X-rays. In this work, we focused on iodine and synthesized iodine-containing porous organosilica (IPO) nanoparticles. IPO were loaded onto tumor spheroids and the spheroids were irradiated with 33.2 keV monochromatic X-ray. After incubation in CO<inf>2</inf> incubator, destruction of tumor spheroids was observed which was accompanied by apoptosis induction, as determined by the TUNEL assay. By employing the γH2AX assay, we detected double strand DNA cleavages immediately after the irradiation. These results suggest that IPO first generate double strand DNA breaks upon X-ray irradiation followed by apoptosis induction of cancer cells. Use of three different monochromatic X-rays having energy levels of 33.0, 33.2 and 33.4 keV as well as X-rays with 0.1 keV energy intervals showed that the optimum effect of all three events (spheroid destruction, apoptosis induction and generation of double strand DNA breaks) occurred with a 33.2 keV monochromatic X-ray. These results uncover the preferential effect of K-edge energy X-ray for tumor spheroid destruction mediated by iodine containing nanoparticles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","iodine; nanoparticle; organic compound; silicon dioxide; apoptosis; chemistry; DNA strand breakage; double stranded DNA break; human; multicellular spheroid; neoplasm; pathology; porosity; radiation response; synthesis; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; X ray; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Breaks; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Humans; Iodine; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Organic Chemicals; Porosity; Silicon Dioxide; Spheroids, Cellular; X-Rays","","iodine, 7553-56-2; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; Iodine; Organic Chemicals; Silicon Dioxide","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant nos.

The data, collected at center-of-mass energies at or near the (4S) resonance, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 72 fb-1. The results, τ(D0)=410.5±1.1(stat)±0.8(syst) fs and τ(D+)=1030.4±4.7(stat)±3.1(syst) fs, are the most precise to date and are consistent with previous determinations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Asymmetric-energy e+e- colliders; Center-of-mass energies; Centre-of-mass energies; Integrated luminosity; Measurements of; Precise measurements; SuperKEKB; article; luminance","","","We thank the SuperKEKB group for the excellent operation of the accelerator; the KEK cryogenics group for the efficient operation of the solenoid; the KEK computer group for on-site computing support; and the raw-data centers at BNL, DESY, GridKa, IN2P3, and INFN for off-site computing support.

Here, LA-ICPMS is able to detect concentrations that are less than 0.1%. Using these methods and a large 110-mm diameter Czochralski method-grown cerium-doped lithium calcium aluminum fluoride (Ce3+:LiCaAlF<inf>6</inf> or Ce:LiCAF), we observed that Ce is distributed non-uniformly with varying concentrations across the diameter of the crystal boule. We further verify quantitatively that luminescence intensity increases in proportion to doping density. Ultraviolet (UV, 290-nm wavelength) laser emissions from areas of the Ce:LiCAF crystal having different doping distributions and concentrations reveal that a uniform doping distribution leads to a higher slope efficiency, lower laser threshold and a potentially higher damage threshold even though the doping concentration is low compared to areas with high but non-uniform doping. Our results show a means of improving laser performance by aiming to achieve a uniform doping distribution; and multi-photon luminescence and LA-ICPMS are powerful tools that could aid in this process. Improved laser performance could lead to new breakthroughs in laser output energies especially in the UV region for many applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","A1.

Knowing the health characteristics of individuals living alone can help identify high-risk groups. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe characteristics of the Vietnamese older adults and to investigate the association between living alone and their reported health outcomes by utilizing survey data of individuals aged ≥60 years in Vietnam in 2018. The community survey included questions about sociodemographic factors, living arrangement, and self-reported physical functional status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine whether or not living alone was a predictor of health outcomes. Of 725 study participants, 8.9% lived alone. These participants were more likely to be female, aged 70–79 years, living in rural areas, and currently single or previously married. After adjusting for covariates, older adults who were living alone were more likely to have arthritis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–3.45), a history of falling (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.02–5.82), visual difficulties (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.04–3.41), feelings of loneliness (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.10–3.47), and high fear of falling (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.02–3.46). Older adults living alone in Vietnam were at greater risk of negative health consequences than those living with others. Screening and providing adequate social support for this specific population is important in preventing the adverse effects of solitary living among these older adults. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Health; Living alone; Older adult; Outcome","health impact; health risk; health survey; multivariate analysis; public health; regression analysis; aged; arthritis; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; face to face interview; falling; fear; feelings of loneliness; female; functional health status; health status; high fear of falling; human; interview; living alone; loneliness; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; population research; risk factor; rural area; self report; social life; sociodemographics; structured questionnaire; Viet Nam; Vietnamese; visual disorder; epidemiology; questionnaire; Accidental Falls; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vietnam","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: We would like to thank the support from Institute for Community Health Research, University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hue University and WHO Centre for Health Development.; Funding text 2: Funding: This work was supported by the grant of Institute for Community Health Research, University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hue University.","Country Report Vietnam Vietnam as an Ageing Society, (2021); Completed Results of the 2019 Viet Nam Population and Housing Census, (2020); Living Arrangements of Older Persons A Report on an Expanded International Dataset, (2017); Ageing and Health in Viet Nam, (2020); Vietnam Aging Survey Vnas 2011 Key Findings, (2012); Roystonn, Kumarasan, Living arrangements and cognitive abilities of community-dwelling older adults in Singapore, Psychogeriatrics, 20, 5, pp. 625-635, (2020); Hamid, Tengku Aizan Abdul, Do Living Arrangements and Social Network Influence the Mental Health Status of Older Adults in Malaysia?, Frontiers in Public Health, 9, (2021); Meemon, Natthani, Older adults living alone in thailand: Socioeconomic inequality and its relation to unmet health needs, Asia-Pacific Social Science Review, 20, 4, pp. 17-31, (2020); Ng, Nawi, Living alone and mortality among older people in Västerbotten County in Sweden: A survey and register-based longitudinal study, BMC Geriatrics, 20, 1, (2020); Barbosa, Fátima Cristina Senra, The impact of living alone on physical and mental health: Does loneliness matter?, pp. 243-248, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","16604601; 16617827","","","34769635","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117521720"

We empirically investigated the effects of several biological traits on phylogeographic patterns of selected marine fishes. We predict that overall similarity in these traits correlates with similarity in phylogeographic patterns among species, and that genetic diversity and demographic stability are associated with these traits, as well as the local (paleo)environment. Location: Five localities in the South China Sea (SCS). Taxon: Thirteen species of coastal marine fishes. Methods: Phylogeographic Concordance Factors (PCFs) based on mitochondrial DNA sequences were tested for correlation with similarity based on distribution range, depth of occurrence, habitat preference, salinity tolerance and fecundity among the subset of the focal species. The relationship between phylogeographic patterns and these traits was also qualitatively examined. Bayesian model averaging was used to test the association between these traits and the genetic diversity estimates. Results: Pairwise PCFs of five species across all localities were correlated with pairwise biological similarity, with depth and distribution ranges contributing most to the biological similarity. Nucleotide diversity of Indo-west Pacific species tended to be greater than that of circumtropical species. Populations showing signs of demographic expansions were concentrated in three localities. A novel concordant population break across six focal species and other marine organisms coincided with the dispersal barrier previously suggested by biophysical dispersal modelling. Main conclusions: Abiotic factors were dominant in controlling phylogeographic patterns, with possible contributions from biotic factors. Depth and distribution ranges, or other eco-physiological traits underlying these, might have influenced the phylogeographic patterns of several species, presumably coupled with historical vicariance. The geography of local populations relative to the shallow continental shelf may explain the heterogeneous demography. Historical vicariance and contemporary ocean currents have contributed to the concordant population break. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","comparative phylogeography; historical demography; Indo-Pacific Ocean; pelagic fish; phylogeographic concordance; Pleistocene; Sunda Shelf","adaptation; coastal zone; continental shelf; demography; ecophysiology; environmental factor; fecundity; fish; genetic variation; mitochondrial DNA; paleoenvironment; phylogeography; range expansion; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Pisces","","","Funding text 1: We thank M.

More urgently, Cu released from fungicides can associate with soil clay and favour the mutual aggregation of Cu and soil clay, thereby potentially intensifying the accumulation of Cu. We investigated the effects of Cu salt and six common Cu-based fungicides on colloidal dynamics of a clay fraction from citrus cultivated soil. Batch experiments were carried out to provide the loading capacity of the clay fraction for Cu. The colloidal dynamic experiments were performed over a pH range from 3 to 8 following a test tube method, while surface charge, the key electrochemical factor of the solid-liquid interface, was quantified by a particle charge detector. It was found that all the studied fungicides, via releasing Cu2+, acted to effectively favour clay aggregation. The dissolved organic matter obtained from the dissolution of polymers in fungicides can theoretically stimulate clay dispersion. However, their effects were obscured due to the overwhelming effect of Cu2+. Therefore, Cu2+ appears as the most active agent in the fungicides that intensifies clay aggregation. These findings imply that the intensive application of fungicides for plant protection purposes can inadvertently reduce clay mobility, favour the co-aggregation of clay and fungicides, and hence potentially exacerbate the contamination of the citrus soil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accumulation; Citrus soil; Clay mobility; Copper; Fungicide","Agglomeration; Fungicides; Phase interfaces; Soils; Sols; Accumulation; Citrus soil; Clay fractions; Clay mobility; Colloidal dynamics; Copper accumulation; Copper cu; Fungal disease; Fungicide application; Soil clay; Copper; clay soil; dissolution; electrochemical method; fungicide; geoaccumulation; organic matter; pH; polymer; soil pollution; Citrus; copper; clay; soil; soil pollutant; Clay; Fungicides, Industrial; Soil; Soil Pollutants","","copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; Clay; Copper; Fungicides, Industrial; Soil; Soil Pollutants","This research is funded by the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under project number QG.21.23 .","Adeleye, Adeyemi S., Influence of extracellular polymeric substances on the long-term fate, dissolution, and speciation of copper-based nanoparticles, Environmental Science and Technology, 48, 21, pp. 12561-12568, (2014); Chorom, Mostafa, Dispersion and zeta potential of pure clays as related to net particle charge under varying pH, electrolyte concentration and cation type, European Journal of Soil Science, 46, 4, pp. 657-665, (1995); Epstein, Lynn H., Pesticide applications of copper on perennial crops in California, 1993 to 1998, Journal of Environmental Quality, 30, 5, pp. 1844-1847, (2001); undefined, (2018); Fagnano, Massimo M., Copper accumulation in agricultural soils: Risks for the food chain and soil microbial populations, Science of the Total Environment, 734, (2020); Fan, Jinghua, Accumulation and availability of copper in citrus grove soils as affected by fungicide application, Journal of Soils and Sediments, 11, 4, pp. 639-648, (2011); Frenkel, Haim, Organic and inorganic anion effects on reference and soil clay critical flocculation concentration, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 56, 6, pp. 1762-1766, (1992); Goldberg, Sabine, Flocculation of reference clays and arid-zone soil clays, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 54, 3, pp. 714-718, (1990); Citrus Journal, (1997); Heil, Dean M., Organic matter role in illitic soil colloids flocculation: II.

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of collected at the resonance and a sample of collected at an energy 60 MeV below the resonance. Because the measurable decay signature involves only a single charged kaon, a novel measurement approach is used that exploits not only the properties of the decay, but also the inclusive properties of the other meson in the event, to suppress the background from other meson decays and light-quark pair production. This inclusive tagging approach offers a higher signal efficiency compared to previous searches. No significant signal is observed.

Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were the initial materials used for fabricating the filaments. The MWCNTs were dispersed in ABS resin, then extruded through a single-shaft extruder in filament form, with MWCNT contents of 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 3% or 4% by weight. After extrusion, the diameter of the filaments was about 1.75 mm, making them appropriate for FDM. The as-synthesized filaments were then used in FDM to print out samples, on which tensile tests and other analyses were carried out. The results demonstrate that the sample with 2% MWCNTs had the highest strength value, 44.57 MPa, comprising a 42% increase over that of the pure ABS sample. The morphology and dispersion of MWCNTs in the composite were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), demonstrating the uniform distribution of MWCNTs in the ABS matrix. The thermal behavior results indicated no significant change in the ABS structure; however, the melt flow index of the filaments decreased with an increase in the MWCNT content. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D printing; ABS; Composite filament; FDM; Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam, and we acknowledge the support of the SAHEP project for performing the testing analyses at the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

The plantation of fast-growing trees, such as Acacia spp., is expanding rapidly in tropical regions, which can contribute to conserve the remaining native tropical forests. To better understand belowground biogeochemical cycles and the sustainable productivity of acacia plantations, we assessed the effects of vegetation (acacia plantations vs. native forests) and soil types (Oxisols vs. Ultisols) on soil properties, including the diversity and community structures of bacteria- and fungi-colonizing surface and subsurface roots and soil in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The results in surface soil showed that pH was significantly higher in acacia than in native for Oxisols but not for Ultisols, while exchangeable Al was significantly lower in acacia than in native for Ultisols but not for Oxisols. Bacterial alpha diversity (especially within phylum Chloroflexi) was higher in acacia than in native only for Oxisols but not for Ultisols, which was the same statistical result as soil pH but not exchangeable Al. These results suggest that soil pH, but not exchangeable Al, can be the critical factor to determine bacterial diversity. Acacia tree roots supported greater proportions of copiotrophic bacteria, which may support lower contents of soil inorganic N, compared with native tree roots for both Oxisols and Ultisols. Acacia tree roots also supported greater proportions of plant pathogenic Mycoleptodiscus sp. but appeared to reduce the abundances and diversity of beneficial ECM fungi compared with native tree roots regardless of soil types. Such changes in fungal community structures may threaten the sustainable productivity of acacia plantations in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acacia plantations; FUNGuild; microbial diversity; Oxisols; root microbiome; tropical mountain forests; Ultisols","Acacia; article; bacterial colonization; biogeochemical cycle; Chloroflexi; community structure; forest; fungal community; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; phylum; plant disease; plant root; plantation; productivity; soil acidity; soil microflora; surface soil; vegetation; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Pham Cuong (Hue University), Chihiro Okada (Kyoto University), and the villagers of So’ n Lang commune for supports on field survey and giving us the field information, and Makoto Shibata (Kyoto University) and Tetsuhiro Watanabe (Kyoto University) for valuable discussions.; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (Nos. 17H06171, 18H02315 and 19K20434).","Baldrian, Petr, Forest microbiome: Diversity, complexity and dynamics, FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 41, 2, pp. 109-130, (2017); Ballauff, Johannes, Shifts in root and soil chemistry drive the assembly of belowground fungal communities in tropical land-use systems, Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 154, (2021); Berthrong, Sean T., A global meta-analysis of soil exchangeable cations, pH, carbon, and nitrogen with afforestation, Ecological Applications, 19, 8, pp. 2228-2241, (2009); Bonito, Gregory M., Plant host and soil origin influence fungal and bacterial assemblages in the roots of woody plants, Molecular Ecology, 23, 13, pp. 3356-3370, (2014); Brinkmann, Nicole, Intensive tropical land use massively shifts soil fungal communities, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Caporaso, J.

PMAPTAC was successfully synthesized and characterized by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) methods. PMAPTAC characteristics were found to be M<inf>n</inf> = 1.61 × 105, M<inf>w</inf> = 2.16 × 106, M<inf>w</inf>/M<inf>n</inf> = 13.4. Beta-lactam cefixime (CEF) removal was dramatically enhanced after polymer coating by pre-adsorption of PMAPTAC on nano-SiO<inf>2</inf>. The new adsorbent was dubbed PMAPTAC coated nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> (PCNS). Required time for adsorption, PCNS dosage, pH, and KCl concentration were thoroughly optimized for CEF removal and achieved at 120 min, 10 mg/mL, 4, and 1 mM, respectively. A two-step model can be used to fit the PMAPTAC on nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> and CEF on PCNS isotherms at different ionic strengths. Adsorption kinetics of CEF on PCNS appears to be pseudo-second-order. CEF removal using PCNS reached 89%, saturating at 10.9 mg/g. The driving force for CEF adsorption on PCNS was primarily Coulombic interaction of negative CEF species and positive surface charge of PCNS. After three reuses, CEF elimination was still greater than 85%. The influence of some organics on CEF treatment using PCNS was insignificant while CEF removal from a real hospital wastewater sample was greater than 70%. Our study indicates that a hybrid and new adsorbent based on nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> rice husk with pre-adsorption with PMAPTAC is useful for antibiotic removal from wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Cefixime; Coating, nanosilica; PMAPTAC","Chlorine compounds; Gel permeation chromatography; Ionic strength; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Plastic coatings; Potassium compounds; Silica; Wastewater treatment; Adsorptive removal; Cefixime; Coating, nanosilicum; Nano Silica; Nano-SiO$-2$; Poly(3-methacryloylamino propyl-trimethylammonium chloride); Polycations; Pre-adsorption; Rice husk; Synthesised; Adsorption","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under project number QG.20.22 .

Adhesion strength of HAp and OCP layers was evaluated before and after immersing in a medium for 14 days by a pull-off test. The corrosion resistance of these coatings was measured by polarization tests performed in a simulated body fluid (SBF). XRD analysis demonstrated that HAp coating layers were formed at pH 7.5 and 8.6, while OCP coating layers were formed at pH 5.5 and 6.2. Adhesion test results showed that the as-coated pH7.5-HAp layer had the highest adhesion strength of 8.6 MPa, which was attributed to the very dense structure of the coating layer. The as-coated pH8.6-HAp layer showed the adhesion strength of 6.5 MPa. The adhesion strength of the as-coated pH5.5- and pH6.2-OCP layers was 3.9 and 7.1 MPa, respectively, that was governed by the thick and fragile property of the layers. After immersing in the medium for 14 days, the adhesion strength of pH7.5- and pH8.6-specimens decreased to 5.8 and 5.6 MPa, respectively. The pitting corrosion and formation of Mg(OH)<inf>2</inf> under the HAp layers were responsible for the decrease of adhesion strength. The polarization tests in SBF at 37 °C showed that the corrosion current density decreased with the HAp and OCP coatings, indicating the improvement of the corrosion resistance of WE43 alloy. The HAp coatings improved the corrosion resistance more efficiently than the OCP coatings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adhesion strength; biodegradable; corrosion; HAp coating; Magnesium alloy; OCP coating","Adhesion; Body fluids; Bond strength (materials); Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Hydroxyapatite; Magnesium compounds; Pitting; Polarization; Rare earths; Chemical solution deposition method; Coating solution; Corrosion current densities; Dense structures; Hydroxyapatite (HAp); Octacalcium phosphate; Polarization tests; Simulated body fluids; Corrosion resistant coatings; alloy; calcium phosphate; hydroxyapatite; biocompatible coated material; WE43 alloy; Article; body fluid; chemical analysis; chemical structure; coating (procedure); corrosion; pH; polarization; simulation; synthesis; X ray diffraction; adhesion; chemistry; materials testing; solution and solubility; surface property; Adhesiveness; Alloys; Calcium Phosphates; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Corrosion; Durapatite; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Materials Testing; Solutions; Surface Properties","","calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; Alloys; Calcium Phosphates; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Durapatite; octacalcium phosphate; Solutions; WE43 alloy","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was completed with the financial support of the CS.03/20–21.

In the present study, we have developed three novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) models which is a combination of modified RealAdaBoost (MRAB), bagging (BA), and rotation forest (RF) ensembles with functional tree (FT) base classifier for the groundwater potential mapping (GPM) in the basaltic terrain at DakLak province, Highland Centre, Vietnam. Based on the literature survey, these proposed hybrid AI models are new and have not been used in the GPM of an area. Geospatial techniques were used and geo-hydrological data of 130 groundwater wells and 12 topographical and geo-environmental factors were used in the model studies. One-R Attribute Evaluation feature selection method was used for the selection of relevant input parameters for the development of AI models. The performance of these models was evaluated using various statistical measures including area under the receiver operation curve (AUC). Results indicated that though all the hybrid models developed in this study enhanced the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, but MRAB-FT (AUC = 0.742) model outperformed RF-FT (AUC = 0.736), BA-FT (AUC = 0.714), and single FT (AUC = 0.674) models. Therefore, the MRAB-FT model can be considered as a promising AI hybrid technique for the accurate GPM. Accurate mapping of the groundwater potential zones will help in adequately recharging the aquifer for optimum use of groundwater resources by maintaining the balance between consumption and exploitation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Agricultural robots; Aquifers; Artificial intelligence; Geographic information systems; Mapping; Attribute evaluation; Environmental factors; Feature selection methods; Geospatial techniques; Groundwater potentials; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Prediction accuracy; Statistical measures; Groundwater resources; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; GIS; mapping; parameterization; performance assessment; prediction; topography; water resource; well water; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam; ground water; environmental monitoring; geographic information system; water supply; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Groundwater; Water Resources","","","Funding text 1: We thank the Department of Water Resources Planning and investigation of central highland for providing the part of data used in this study.

Bioremediation has been proven to be an effective, economical, and eco-friendly technique to remove heavy metals from various wastewaters. The newly developed algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has emerged as a promising biosorbent for treating wastewater containing heavy metals, especially Cr(VI). In this study, two identical cylindrical sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), i.e., R1 (Control) and R2 (with 1% additional salinity), were used to cultivate algal-bacterial AGS and then to evaluate the effect of salinity on the performance of the two SBRs. The results reflected that less filamentation and a rougher surface could be observed on algal-bacterial AGS when exposed to 1% salinity, which showed little influence on organics removal. However, the removals of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and total phosphorus (TP) were noticeably impacted at the 1% salinity condition, and were further decreased with the co-existence of 2 mg/L Cr(VI). The Cr(VI) removal efficiency, on the other hand, was 31–51% by R1 and 28–48% by R2, respectively, indicating that salinity exposure may slightly influence Cr(VI) bioremediation. In addition, salinity exposure stimulated more polysaccharides excretion from algal-bacterial AGS while Cr(VI) exposure promoted proteins excretion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge; Bioremediation; Hexavalent chromium; Salinity; Wastewater treatment","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The first author, Bach Van Nguyen, would like to thank the financial and technical support by the Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship by Japanese Grant Aid (JDS), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Institute of Marine Environment and Resources (IMER), Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Vietnam for supporting his study in University of Tsukuba, Japan.; Funding text 2: Funding: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP18H03403.","Sartore, Luciana, Preparation and Heavy Metal Ions Chelating Properties of Multifunctional Polymer-Grafted Silica Hybrid Materials, Advances in Materials Science and Engineering, 2019, (2019); Gibb, Herman Jones, Lung cancer among workers in chromium chemical production, American Journal of Industrial Medicine, 38, 2, pp. 115-126, (2000); Zhitkovich, Anatoly V., Chromium in drinking water: Sources, metabolism, and cancer risks, Chemical Research in Toxicology, 24, 10, pp. 1617-1629, (2011); Tumolo, Marina, Chromium pollution in European water, sources, health risk, and remediation strategies: An overview, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 15, pp. 1-25, (2020); Mitra, Sayak, Removal of chromium from industrial effluents using nanotechnology: a review, Nanotechnology for Environmental Engineering, 2, 1, (2017); Brasili, Elisa, Remediation of hexavalent chromium contaminated water through zero-valent iron nanoparticles and effects on tomato plant growth performance, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Fu, Fenglian, Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 92, 3, pp. 407-418, (2011); Pushkar, Bhupendra Kishanprasad, Chromium pollution and its bioremediation mechanisms in bacteria: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 287, (2021); Joseph, Lesley, Removal of heavy metals from water sources in the developing world using low-cost materials: A review, Chemosphere, 229, pp. 142-159, (2019); Zabochnicka, Magdalena, Potentials of biosorption and bioaccumulation processes for heavy metal removal, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies, 23, 2, pp. 551-561, (2014)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","22279717","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113340694"

Total concentrations of PBDEs and NBFRs in indoor dust samples ranged from 43 to 480 ng g−1 (median 170 ng g−1) and from 56 to 2200 ng g−1 (median 180 ng g−1), respectively. The most abundant PBDE congener in these dust samples was BDE-209 with concentrations ranging from 29 to 360 ng g−1, accounting for 62.6–86.5% of total PBDE levels. Among the NBFRs analyzed, decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) was the predominant compound with a mean contribution of 98.6% total NBFR amounts. Significant concentrations of DBDPE were detected in all dust samples (median 180 ng g−1, range 54–2200 ng g−1), due to DBDPE as a substitute for deca-BDE. Other NBFRs such as 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) and 2,2’,4,4’,5,5’-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) were found at very low levels. Based on the measured BFR concentrations, daily intake doses (IDs) of PBDEs and NBFRs via dust ingestion at exposure scenarios using the median and 95th percentile levels for both adults and children were calculated for risk assessment. The results showed that the daily exposure doses via dust ingestion of all compounds, even in the high-exposure scenarios were also lower than their reference dose (RfD) values. The lifetime cancer risks (LTCR) were much lower than the threshold level (10−6), which indicated the acceptable health risks resulting from indoor BFRs exposure for urban residents in Hanoi. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE); Hanoi urban area; House dust; Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs); Risk assessment","cancer; chemical compound; flame retardant; health risk; indoor air; PBDE; pollutant source; pollution exposure; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; Hanoi; Viet Nam; diphenyl ether derivative; adult; child; dust; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Vietnam","","Dust; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers","This research was funded by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under grant number \u201CT\u00D0PCCC.02/ 18-20\u201D, Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research (Fostering Joint International Research (B)) (18KK0300) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).","Alaee, Mehran, The significance of brominated flame retardants in the environment: Current understanding, issues and challenges, Chemosphere, 46, 5, pp. 579-582, (2002); Alaee, Mehran, An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release, Environment International, 29, 6, pp. 683-689, (2003); Aleksa, Katarina, Detection of polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in pediatric hair as a tool for determining in utero exposure, Forensic Science International, 218, 1-3, pp. 37-43, (2012); Ali, Nadeem, Assessment of human exposure to indoor organic contaminants via dust ingestion in Pakistan, Indoor Air, 22, 3, pp. 200-211, (2012); Ali, Nadeem, Levels and profiles of organochlorines and flame retardants in car and house dust from Kuwait and Pakistan: Implication for human exposure via dust ingestion, Environment International, 55, pp. 62-70, (2013); Ali, Nadeem, Brominated and organophosphate flame retardants in indoor dust of Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Implications for human exposure, Science of the Total Environment, 569-570, pp. 269-277, (2016); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in plastic products, indoor dust, sediment and fish from informal e-waste recycling sites in Vietnam: a comprehensive assessment of contamination, accumulation pattern, emissions, and human exposure, Environmental Geochemistry and Health, 39, 4, pp. 935-954, (2017); Hoang, Anhquoc, PBDEs and novel brominated flame retardants in road dust from northern Vietnam: Levels, congener profiles, emission sources and implications for human exposure, Chemosphere, 197, pp. 389-398, (2018); Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, (2004); Batterman, Stuart A., Concentrations and emissions of polybrominated diphenyl ethers from U.S. houses and garages, Environmental Science and Technology, 43, 8, pp. 2693-2700, (2009)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09441344; 16147499","","ESPLE","33837942","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104229519"

Broad-scale seagrass distribution has not been updated in the global seagrass database by UNEP-WCMC since 2000, although studies on seagrasses have been undertaken intensively in each region. Here we analyze the recent distribution of tropical seagrass beds, their temporal changes, causes of decline and conservation status in Southeast Asia (plus southern mainland China, Taiwan and Ryukyu Island of Japan) using data collected after 2000. Based on the 195 literature published since 2000, we identified 1,259 point data and 1,461 polygon data showing the distribution of seagrass beds. A large discrepancy was found in the seagrass bed distribution between our updated data and the UNEP-WCMC database, mostly due to inaccurate and low resolution location information in the latter. Temporal changes in seagrass bed area analyzed for 68 sites in nine countries/regions demonstrated that more than 60% of seagrass beds declined at an average rate of 10.9% year–1, whereas 20% of beds increased at an average rate of 8.1% year–1, leading to an overall average decline of 4.7% year–1. Various types of human-induced threats were reported as causes for the decline, including coastal development, fisheries/aquaculture, and natural factors such as typhoons and tsunamis. The percentage of seagrass beds covered with existing marine protected areas (MPAs) varied greatly among countries/regions, from less than 1% in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore to 100% in southern Japan. However, the degree of conservation regulation was not sufficient even in regions with higher MPA coverage. The percentage of seagrass beds within EBSAs (Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area determined by the Convention of Biological Diversity) was higher than that within MPAs because EBSAs cover a greater area than MPAs. Therefore, designating EBSAs as legally effective MPAs can greatly improve the conservation status of seagrass beds in Southeast Asia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","broad-scale distribution; coastal ecosystem; GIS mapping; marine protected area; temporal trend","","","","Funding text 1: This manuscript is a contribution to the Asia-Pacific Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (AP-MBON) of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON).

Interface elements were introduced with the new constitutive equations developed by the authors to properly evaluate the interaction between the footing and the soil because these elements greatly affect the failure mechanism of the footing-soil system. Two friction conditions were employed for the footing surface, namely, the perfectly rough condition and the perfectly smooth condition. The RPFEM was extended to calculate the distribution of contact normal stress along the footing base corresponding to changes in the thickness of the sand layer. Several design charts were developed to directly determine the ultimate bearing capacity by increasing the internal friction angle, the thickness of the sand layer, and the shear strength of the clay layer. Two cases were considered for the clay layer below the sand layer, namely, a weak layer and a stiff layer. The failure mode of two-layered soils was found to change from the general shear mode to the punching shear mode for both friction conditions by a reduction in the shear strength of the clay layer. The sheared area of the ground was limited to the sand layer in the general shear mode, while the sheared area was distributed throughout the two layers in the punching shear mode. New bearing capacity formulas during the punching shear mode were proposed for the two friction conditions in a wide range of strength and geometric parameters, which were in close agreement with the experimental studies and are efficient enough to be used in practice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bearing capacity; Clayey soil; Footings; Layered soils; Sandy soil","Bearing capacity; Constitutive equations; Failure (mechanical); Friction; Sand; Soils; Bearing capacity formulas; Failure mechanism; Friction conditions; Interface elements; Internal friction angle; Rigid plastic finite element method; Two-layered soils; Ultimate bearing capacity; Shear strength; bearing capacity; clay soil; finite element method; footing; layered medium; sandy soil; soil-structure interaction","","","This work was supported by The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology (Project No. T2021-02-04).","Asaoka, Akira, ANALYSIS OF FAILURE OF A NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY FOUNDATION UNDER EMBANKMENT LOADING., Soils and Foundations, 26, 2, pp. 47-59, (1986); Asaoka, Akira, BEARING CAPACITY ANALYSIS OF A NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY FOUNDATION., Soils and Foundations, 27, 3, pp. 58-70, (1987); Asaoka, Akira, Coupling analyses of limiting equilibrium state for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils, Soils and Foundations, 30, 3, pp. 109-123, (1990); Canadian Geotechnical Journal, (1964); Burd, H.

Cluster analysis shows that the different community structures were formed under the influence of CIP toxicity. CIP decreased attached growth biomass by 2.3 times while increasing the concentration of permeate nitrate by 3.8 times, greatly affecting TN removal by up to 26%. Ammonia removal was kept stable by inflating the ammonia removal rate (p < 0.003), with the wealthy Nitrospira genus guaranteeing the nitrification activity. In addition, we observed an increasing richness of Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes, which may play a role in fouling reduction in the Sponge-MBR.

Six kinds of commercial nanofiltration membrane were investigated. The results showed that the rejection of benzoic acid was significantly lower than that of other components in cranberry juice, including sugars and other organic acids. In a range of 2-7.5 L/min, feed flow rate slightly affected the performance of nanofiltration. Higher temperatures resulted in higher permeate flux and lower rejection of benzoic acid, whereas rejection of sugar and organic acid was stable at a high value. In a range of 2.5-5.5, pH also significantly affected the separation of benzoic acid and negative rejection against benzoic acid was observed at pH 4.5 with some of the membranes. This implies that pH 4.5 is considered as an optimum pH for benzoic acid separation from cranberry juice. The lower permeate flux caused a lower rejection of benzoic acid and negative rejection of benzoic acid was observed at the low permeate flux. Pretreatment by ultrafiltration with CR61PP membranes could improve the permeate flux but insignificantly influenced the efficiency of separation. The results also indicated that NF99 and DK membranes can be effectively used to separate benzoic acid from cranberry juice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzoic acid; Cranberry juice; Feed flow rate; Nanofiltration; Negative rejection","Fruit juices; Nanofiltration; Nanofiltration membranes; Acid separation; Cranberry juice; Cross-flow nanofiltration; Feed flow rate; Permeate flux; Pilot scale; Pre-Treatment; Technological parameters; Benzoic acid","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research is funded by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM under grant number HCMUT-002550-2021.; Funding text 2: This research is funded by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNUHCM under grant number HCMUT-002550-2021.","Extraction, (2019); Zuo, Yuegang, Separation, characterization, and quantitation of benzoic and phenolic antioxidants in American cranberry fruit by GC-MS, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 50, 13, pp. 3789-3794, (2002); Pappas, E., Phytochemicals of cranberries and cranberry products: Characterization, potential health effects, and processing stability, Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 49, 9, pp. 741-781, (2009); Abdel-Fatah, Mona A., Nanofiltration systems and applications in wastewater treatment: Review article, Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 9, 4, pp. 3077-3092, (2018); Marchetti, Patrizia, Molecular separation with organic solvent nanofiltration: A critical review, Chemical Reviews, 114, 21, pp. 10735-10806, (2014); Tonova, Konstantza, Separation of glucose, other reducing sugars and phenolics from natural extract by nanofiltration: Effect of pressure and cross-flow velocity, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 162, pp. 107-116, (2020); Esteves, Teresa, A study on lupin beans process wastewater nanofiltration treatment and lupanine recovery, Journal of Cleaner Production, 277, (2020); Khairul Zaman, Nadiah, Recovery of organic acids from fermentation broth using nanofiltration technologies: A review, Journal of Physical Science, 28, pp. 85-109, (2017); Laurio, Michael Vincent O., Process scale-up, economic, environmental assessment of vibratory nanofiltration of coffee extracts for soluble coffee production process intensification, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 22, 9, pp. 1891-1908, (2020); Cassano, Alfredo, Current and future applications of nanofiltration in food processing, pp. 305-348, (2018)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20770375","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105557843"

However, information on the current status of seagrass beds from Southern Viet Nam is limited due to lack of reliable data about seagrass species occurring in the Southeast Asian region. One factor is the difficulty of unambiguous species identification. For example, the leaf morphological characteristics of Halophila ovalis and closely related species are overlapping which leads to misidentifications. In this study, the latest satellite Landsat 8 OLI and SENTINEL-2B image analyses were applied to determine the distribution of seagrass beds in Southern Viet Nam. Detailed morphological and genetic marker analyses were used to determine and update the species composition. The present study together with literature reviews indicate that the total area of seagrass beds from Southern Viet Nam are 10,832.1 ha. 2562 ha (or 19.1%) of seagrass coverage has been lost. The seagrass beds at Phu Quoc Island are the largest with 7579 ha. The occurrence of Halophila major is updated for almost all off-shore islands and open-water areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Satellite data; Seagrass; Southern Viet Nam; Species distribution","","","","Funding text 1: We are deeply indebted to all staff of the Department of Marine Botany, Center for Oceanographic Data, GIS and Remote Sensing, Institute of Oceanography (ION), Viet Nam, for their support, generously providing many valuable suggestions.

The feed that was separated from urban organic solid waste was collected at households and restaurants in District 1, HCMC. This study aimed to investigate the resource recovery performance of the pilot two-stage anaerobic digestion system, in terms of carbon recovery via biogas production and nutrient recovery from digestate. The average organic loading rate (OLR) of the system was step increased from 1.6 kg volatile solids (VS)·m−3·d−1, 2.5 kg VS·m−3·d−1 and 3.8 kg VS·m−3·d−1 during 400 days of operation. During the long-term operation at three OLRs, pH values and alkalinity were stable at both hydrolysis and methanogenesis stages without any addition of alkalinity for the methanogenesis phase. High buildup of propanoic acid and total volatile fatty acid concentrations in the fermenter did not drop pH values and inhibit the methanogenic process at high OLRs (2.5–3.8 kg VS m−3·d−1). The obtained total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD) removal performance was 83–87% at the OLRs ranging from 2.5 kg VS·m−3·d−1 and 3.8 kg VS·m−3·d−1, respectively. The highest biogas yield of 263 ± 64 L·kg−1 tCOD removed obtained at OLR of 2.5 kg VS·m−3·d−1. It is expected that a full scale 2S-AD plant with capacity of 5200 tons day−1 of biowaste collected currently from municipal solid waste in HCMC may create daily electricity of 552 MWh, thermal energy of 630 MWh, and recovery of 16.1 tons of NH<inf>4</inf>+-N, 11.4 tons of organic-N, and 2.1 tons of TP as both organic liquid and solid fertilizers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biowaste; Hydrolysis reactor; Methane fermenter; Two-stage anaerobic digestion","Alkalinity; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Chemical oxygen demand; Digestive system; Fermenters; Holmium; Hydrolysis; pH; Propionic acid; Recovery; Volatile fatty acids; Biogas production; Municipal solid waste landfills; Nutrient recovery; Organic loading rates; Organic solid wastes; Removal performance; Total volatile fatty acids; Two-stage anaerobic digestions; Municipal solid waste; biogas; organic nitrogen; phosphorus derivative; propionic acid; volatile fatty acid; biofuel; methane; anaerobic digestion; bioreactor; fermentation; hydrolysis; landfill; municipal solid waste; alkalinity; Article; chemical oxygen demand; concentration (parameter); electricity; methanogenesis; municipal waste; pilot study; recycling; Viet Nam; anaerobic growth; waste disposal; Ho Chi Minh City; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Vietnam","","propionic acid, 72-03-7, 79-09-4; methane, 74-82-8; Biofuels; Methane","Funding text 1: The authors deeply appreciate the kind financial support by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 105.99-2018.308.

Despite this, their taxonomic status and phylogeographical patterns remain unclear due to differing criteria employed by early taxonomists and inconsistencies between morphological and molecular assessments. To address these issues, we undertook a comparative phylogeographic analysis of Asian Scotophilus spp. using integrated genetic and morphological analyses of samples collected across the region. These demonstrate that yellow house bats in Asia can be classified into just two widespread species, namely the smaller S. kuhlii (e.g., FA ≤ 53.1 mm, GLS ≤ 20.18 mm) and the larger S. heathii (e.g., FA ≥ 53.4 mm, GLS ≥ 20.85 mm), which occur in sympatry in different parts of the Indomalayan Region. Although these two sympatric species share similar eco-ethological preferences, they differ considerably in their geographic distributions and intraspecific variation in mtDNA sequences and morphological traits. These disparities were likely misinterpreted as indicating potential cryptic diversity in previous studies, whereas we suggest they are related to interspecific differences in sex-biased gene flow and phenotypic plasticity to adapt to varying environments. Our study highlights the importance of using multiple datasets to resolve taxonomic uncertainties and reconstruct demographic and phylogeographic histories of sympatric species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","comparative phylogeography; integrative taxonomy; multiple datasets; Scotophilus; sympatric species","bat; biogeography; crypsis; genetic variation; integrated approach; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; sympatry; taxonomy; Indonesia; Scotophilus; Vespertilionidae","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank numerous agencies and individuals for their research permits and assistance during our study: In Vietnam, the Vietnam Administration of Forestry (MONRE), Nguyen Van Sinh, Le Xuan Canh and Nguyen Quang Truong of the IEBR (Hanoi); in Cambodia, the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation at the Royal University of Phnom Penh and Fauna & Flora International; in Myanmar, the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development; in Philippines, Juan Carlos T.

Material flow analysis (MFA) is a central concept of this study that involves collecting catfish pond wastewater (CPW) and reusing it to irrigate five water spinach (Ipomoea aquatic) ponds before discharging it into a river. Typically, catfish pond sediment (CPS) was collected and composted to produce organic fertilizer for cornfields. The results revealed that pollutant removal efficiency of wastewater from CPW (by using water spinach) were total organic carbon (TOC) = 38.78%, nitrogen (N) = 27.07%, phosphorous (P) = 58.42%, and potassium (K) = 28.64%. By adding 20 tons of CPS compost per hectare of the cornfield, the corn yield boosted 15% compared to the control field. In addition, the water spinach grew and developed well in the medium of wastewater from the fish pond. Altogether, the results illustrate that catfish pond wastewater and sediment can act as organic fertilizers for crops meanwhile reduce environmental pollution from its reuse. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compost; Corn; Material flow analysis (MFA); Reuse of catfish pond sediment; Water spinach","Agricultural robots; Aquaculture; Composting; Fertilizers; Lakes; Nitrogen removal; Organic carbon; Productivity; River pollution; Sediments; Water recycling; Agricultural productivity; Aquaculture wastewater; Control fields; Environmental pollutions; Material flow analysis; Organic fertilizers; Pollutant removal efficiency; Total Organic Carbon; Wastewater reclamation; nitrogen; organic fertilizer; phosphorus; potassium; agricultural land; compost; crop production; discharge; finfish; leafy vegetable; maize; pollutant removal; pond culture; recycling; sediment; wastewater treatment; aquaculture; Article; catfish; chemical composition; composting; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental impact; food security; household income; Ipomoea aquatica; leaf area; nonhuman; nutrient availability; nutrient concentration; plant development; plant growth; pond; river; sludge; sowing; sustainable agriculture; total organic carbon; waste component removal; waste water recycling; water pollutant; animal; Ipomoea; wastewater; Animals; Ponds; Waste Water; Zea mays","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; Waste Water","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number NCM 2020-24-01","Bioprocess Eng, (2019); Avnimelech, Yoram A., Shrimp and fish pond soils: Processes and management, Aquaculture, 220, 1-4, pp. 549-567, (2003); Coldebella, Anderson, Effluents from fish farming ponds: A view from the perspective of its main components, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 1, (2018); undefined, (2004); Dauda, Akeem Babatunde, Waste production in aquaculture: Sources, components and managements in different culture systems, Aquaculture and Fisheries, 4, 3, pp. 81-88, (2019); Delgado, Ma Del Mar, Sewage sludge compost fertilizer effect on maize yield and soil heavy metal concentration, Revista Internacional de Contaminacion Ambiental, 18, 3, pp. 147-150, (2002); Ghaly, Abdel E., Phytoremediation of aquaculture wastewater for water recycling and production of fish feed, Environment International, 31, 1, pp. 1-13, (2005); Le, Thanh Hai, An integrated ecosystem incorporating renewable energy leading to pollution reduction for sustainable development of craft villages in rural area: a case study at sedge mats village in Mekong Delta, Vietnam, Energy, Sustainability and Society, 6, 1, (2016); Hu, Wei, Potassium application affects carbohydrate metabolism in the leaf subtending the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) boll and its relationship with boll biomass, Field Crops Research, 179, pp. 120-131, (2015); Journal of can Tho University, (2012)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00456535; 18791298","","CMSHA","33360937","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098182224"

Seawater for incubation was pre-filtered using a 200-µm mesh to remove mesozooplankton grazers. Initial concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen were similar in both seasons, but silicic acid and phosphate were higher in April than in November. This allowed us to observe the growth of planktonic communities under varied silicic acid availability and explore the effects of BSi accumulation and food availability on the growth of tintinnids. Phytoplankton blooms dominated by diatoms formed in both, April and November incubations, but their biomass was higher in April than in November, demonstrating the effects of nutrients, particularly silicic acid, on diatom growth. The BSi concentration increased in both incubations but was higher in April than in November, confirming the effects of diatom abundance and size on BSi deposition. Tintinnid biomass also increased in both incubations but was higher in April than in November, showing that the biomass of tintinnid was affected by the BSi concentration. Species composition of diatoms affected the species composition of tintinnids by providing selected material for the construction of their lorica. Moreover, the results showed that the food supply mainly provided by pico-nanoflagellates via microbial loop and detritus may limit tintinnids’ population growth in natural planktonic ecosystems and this demonstrates tintinnids’ role as top predators in the microbial loop © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacteria; Biogenic silica; Diatom biomass; Nutrient availability; Pico-nanoflagellates; Silicic acid; Tintinnid ciliates; Tintinnids lorica","biogenic deposit; biomass; ciliate; concentration (composition); detritus; diatom; food availability; nutrient availability; population growth; silica; silicic acid; zooplankton; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Shizuoka [Chubu]; Suruga Bay; Bacillariophyta; Ciliophora; Lorica","","","This research was supported by the Environmental Leader Program of Shizuoka University (ELSU) through a Research Promotion Grant of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT).

Parabens were frequently detected in PCPs regardless of the paraben indication in their ingredient labels. However, concentrations of parabens in labeled products (median 3280; range 1370–5610 μg/g) were much higher than those found in non-labeled products (69.4; not detected – 356 μg/g). Parabens were also measured in indoor dust samples of this study at elevated concentrations, ranging from not detected to 1650 (median 286 ng/g). Levels of parabens in the indoor dust samples collected in 2019 decreased in the order: house > medical store > laboratory dust, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Interestingly, levels of parabens in Vietnamese house dust exhibited an increasing trend over time, for example, mean/median concentrations of parabens in house dust samples collected in 2014, 2017, and 2019 were 245/205, 310/264, and 505/379 ng/g, respectively. Methylparaben was found at the highest frequency and concentrations in both PCPs and indoor dust samples. Mean exposure doses of total parabens through dust ingestion were estimated to be 2.02, 1.61, 0.968, 0.504, and 0.192 ng/kg-bw/d for infants, toddlers, children, teenagers, and adults, respectively.

The experimental results showed that discharge current peaks in the case of DBD driven by repetitive unipolar pulses were about three times lower than those in the case of DBD driven by bipolar pulses. It is well known that if DBD is driven by bipolar pulses, the effect of surface charge on dielectric layers from the preceding discharge helps to ignite consecutive discharges at the same locations where the previous discharges already struck. In contrast, in the case of DBD generated by using the low-frequency unipolar pulses, the consecutive DBDs just could be initiated after the system erases part of the prehistory effect of surface charge deposition on dielectric layers from the preceding discharge, and then the following discharge was ignited at erased or uncharged areas. It was critical that a part of the energy stored in the dielectric layer and discharge gap by the previous discharge needed to be released to develop the next discharge. The results of this study provided an outlook for estimating the effectiveness of the DBD plasma system used in specific applications such as DBD for flow actuators or surface treatment where the use of unipolar DBDs at low frequency may be necessary. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Dielectric materials; Flow control; Surface charge; Surface discharges; Surface treatment; Charge deposition; Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas; Dielectric barrier discharges; Dielectric layer; Discharge currents; Discharge gaps; Low-frequency; Unipolar pulse; Dielectric devices","","","This research is funded by Funds for Science and Technology Development of the University of Danang under Project No. B2019-DN06-17.","Kogelschatz, Ulrich, Dielectric-barrier discharges: Their History, Discharge Physics, and Industrial Applications, Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, 23, 1, pp. 1-46, (2003); Wagner, Hans Erich, The barrier discharge: Basic properties and applications to surface treatment, Vacuum, 71, 3 SPEC., pp. 417-436, (2003); Gas Discharge Physics, (1991); Roth, J.

The obtained graft copolymer was hydrogenated by a diimide reduction system in the presence of different copper (II) homogeneous catalysts. The effects of styrene to acrylonitrile on the total conversion and the grafting efficiency have been studied. The structural characterization of the obtained copolymers was made by 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR. The graft DPNR was then characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The effects of different copper (II) catalysts on the system have been evaluated by the hydrogenation degree of each hydrogenated sample. The improvement of the thermal properties of the graft copolymers was confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis.

However, 1/f noise is often quite large at low frequencies and inevitably becomes one of the most difficult issues in developing a magnetic field sensor with ultrahigh sensitivity. Low-frequency 1/f noise can have both electric and magnetic origins, and it is a result of complex non-linear interactions between many degrees of freedom inside a sensor. Therefore, a reduction of the 1/f noise can be expected for the magnetic sensor with very small dimensions. Here, the dependence of the 1/f noise on voltage and strong hard-axis bias field in deep submicrometer-sized MgO-based MTJs is investigated with various junction sizes. The noise spectra were measured by using a home-built low-frequency noise measurement setup with maximum frequency up to 30 kHz. We find that the noise spectral power density is 1/f-like at low frequencies.

They consist of3 stages of formation based on the difference ofpetrographic characteristics and ages: the first-stage pegmatites are characterized by quartz (40-45 vol%) and K-feldspar (55-60 vol%), the second-stage pegmatites are composed of K-feldspar (70 vol%), quartz (25 vol%), muscovite (<5 vol%), and biotite (<5 vol%), and the third-stage pegmatites are characterized by K-feldspar (60 vol%) and quartz (25 vol%). K-feldspar has common grain sizes of 0.5-1.0 cm with milky white color and shows perthitic texture. The emplacement ages of pegmatites determined by the zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb method yielded weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of448.2 ± 6.4 Ma (the first-stage), 269.4 ± 3.2 Ma (the second-stage), and 239 ± 3 Ma (the third-stage). The first-stage pegmatites coincide with the Ordovician-Silurian magmatism probably associated with the closure of an ancient oceanic basin within the Kontum massif. The second- and third-stage pegmatites can be linked with Permian-Triassic collisional magmatic activities. Host granitoids were also collected for petrographic investigations and age dating. Biotite-granite (Ben Giang-Que Son Complex) hosting the first- and second-stage pegmatites showed a magmatic age of236.9 ± 2.9 Ma. Granites of the Van Canh Complex hosting the third-stage pegmatites yielded a similar age range between 244.2 ± 3.2 and 241.6 ± 1.7 Ma indicating that the third-stage pegmatite intruded shortly after the formation of the host granite. Based on quality assessments, samples from the second-stage pegmatites (~ 269 Ma) in the study area have the most applicable quality for ceramic manufacture and the technological samples fulfill Vietnam's ceramic standards (VN 6598:2000 standards). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceramic; Kontum massif; Pegmatite; Zircon U-Pb dating","","","","Funding text 1: Thanks to Drs.

The Vietnamese melon was divided into seven cultivar groups, namely “Dua le”, “Dua vang”, “Dua bo”, “Dua gang-andromonoecious”, “Dua gang-monoecious”, “Dua thom”, “Montok”, and the weedy-type melon “Dua dai”. Among these, Dua le, Dua vang, Dua bo, and Dua gang-andromonoecious are cultivated on plains and they formed cluster II along with the reference accessions of Conomon and Makuwa. Based on genetic distance, Dua le and Dua vang were regarded as Makuwa and Dua bo and Dua gang-andromonoecious as Conomon. In contrast, Dua thom and Montok are cultivated in highlands, and they formed cluster III along with landraces from the southern and eastern foot of the Himalayas. Dua gang-monoecious which is commonly cultivated in the southern parts of Vietnam, exhibited the greatest genetic diversity, as explained by its possible origin through the hybridization between Dua gang-andromonoecious and Montok. Genetic differences in melon landraces between plains and highlands and hybridization between these two geographical groups have contributed to the enhancement of genetic diversity in Vietnamese melon. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conomon; Cucumis melo; Genetic diversity; Makuwa; Molecular polymorphism; Population structure; Vietnam","","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAK?NHI Grant Num-? ber 26257409.

However, information on genetic diversity and continuities among local populations remains totally unknown. We explored the genetic structure and population continuities of R. hispidum and L. robustus using genetic markers (COI & ITS1 regions) at 11 locations in four countries in Southeast Asia where fisheries were conducted. Rhopilema populations showed genetic distances (ΦST) among locations correlated positively with geographic distances, suggesting that they are in the isolation-by-distance (IBD). In Lobonemoides, molecular analysis revealed three distinct clades corresponding to sampling locations. Genetic distances among locations in L. robustus suggested that all populations maintain significant isolation. Our study reveals that these two blooming species have different phylogeographic patterns and differ in genetic diversity and continuities.

Through a multivariate analysis, the treeshrews from South Vietnam exhibited distinct morphological characteristics compared to other populations from Thailand and Laos, and Malaysia. The plots of the specimens of North Vietnam are not randomly mixed with Thailand plots segregation in the scatteregrams of canonical discriminant analysis. Since the skulls of the population from North Vietnam were morphologically similar to those form central Laos and northern and northeastern Thailand, the zoogeographical barrier effect of Mekong River was not clearly confirmed. The population of the Kanchanaburi in western Thailand is clearly smaller in size compared to the other populations. The southern border of the distribution of this species is determined by the Isthmus of Kra or Kangar-Pattani Line. In the northern treeshrew, which is distributed from southern China to Bangladesh and southern Thailand, we have detected osteometrical geographical variation driven by geography. These results indicate that the skull morphology in the Tupaia glis-belangeri complex distinctively differs in South Vietnam, western Thailand, and southern Thailand. The zoogeographical barrier and factor separating these districts are expected to clarify in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geographical variation; Isthmus of kra; Mekong river; Northern treeshrew; Skull","article; Bangladesh; China; geography; nonhuman; river; skull; Thailand; Tupaia belangeri; Viet Nam; animal; Malaysia; Tupaia; Animals; Skull; Vietnam","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

We discovered a species of the genus Blackfordia in Vietnam for the first time. Morphological and molecular analyses revealed that this Vietnamese Blackfordia had an intermediate number of tentacles compared with its congeners, and a similar number of tentacles had been reported in Blackfordia only in Brazil, Mexico and India. Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicated that Vietnamese Blackfordia formed a sub-clade with “B. virginica” from Brazil, and differed from B. virginica from other locations, having a K2P distance of >0.13.

In this study, the rice growth was observed by a small UAV-based LiDAR system from above. For developing the system, DJI S800 was chosen as a platform on which a non-survey-grade laser scanner HOKUYO UTM30LX-EW was mounted. Field experiments were carried out from late June to late early August 2017 in Nagaoka city, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Percentile analysis is applied to locate the top and bottom positions of rice plants in three targeted areas. LIDAR-derived plant height is computed by taking the difference between the bottom and the rice plant's top. As a result, the LiDAR-derived canopy height well correlates to rice plant height (R2 ≥0.86; RMSE <6.0 cm). The small root means square error (RMSE =4.9 cm) is achieved with area 3. In the general case, the RMSE is 5.5 cm (R2 =0.88).

We determined species diversity, seasonal reproduction, and echolocation patterns in the bat community of Bidoup Nui Ba National Park (BNBNP), Lam Dong Province, on the Dalat Plateau of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. We documented 27 species with 211 individuals captured in 26 994 m2 mist-net-hours and 3015 m2 harp-trap-hours of effort. We found five species of pteropodids and 22 species of insectivorous bats in four families, including regional records and species seldom captured in Vietnam. Bat species richness at BNBNP is now known to be 33 species, including six found in a prior study. Based on the inverse Simpson Index of Diversity, evenness of captures was low, reflecting the high abundance of a few species with many species documented by just one or two individuals. Insectivorous bats were pregnant in the late dry season, but not during the wet season when lactation occurred and volant juveniles were captured. Echolocation call characteristics were determined for 19 species of insectivorous bats. Call patterns were consistent with some but not all reports in the literature from elsewhere in southeast Asia. This suggests theexistence of cryptic species or geographic and habitat variability in echolocation calls of southeast Asian bats that requires further study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","echolocation; reproduction; species diversity; Vietnam","","","","Acknowledgments: We are grateful to the Director, and staff of Bidoup-Nui Ba National Park, Director of IEBR for support with field survey.

In recent years, the outbreaks of cyanobacteria blooms in Tri An and Dau Tieng Reservoirs, Vietnam have led to an increase attention in taste and odour problems. In the present study, the two off-flavour compounds geosmin and 2-MIB were found in field samples and 50 isolated strains of planktonic cyanobacteria from Dau Tieng and Tri An Reservoirs. They were screened for the first time using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPME GC–MS). The ability to produce off-flavour compounds was determined by the presence of two molecular markers: geoA and mib. Results showed that mean geosmin and 2-MIB concentrations ranged from 13.3 to 9.6 ng/L and 4.9 to 101.7 ng/L in field samples, respectively. A total of five geosmin-producing strains [with the highest concentration: 272.9 ng/g wet weight (ww)] and nine 2-MIB-producing strains (with the highest concentration: 362.1 ng/g ww) belonging to two cyanobacteria genera Dolichospermum and Oscillatoria were identified. Four of the geosmin producers also produced 2-MIB. The 16S rRNA maximum likelihood (ML) tree showed a high diversity of the isolated strains that represented different morphotypes and genotypes. The BLAST searches revealed that the 16S rRNA gene sequence obtained in this study shared the similarity values ranging between 96.46 and 99.37% compared to the available sequences from GenBank. This is the first report of off-flavour compound producing cyanobacteria in Vietnamese waters. The combination of HPME GC–MS and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a robust tool for reliably characterizing the off-flavour compound. Our results highlight that taste and odour-producing cyanobacteria belonging to Chroococcales in Vietnamese waters are unexplored and require further investigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyanobacteria; Off-flavour compounds; Taste and odour; Tropical water","algal bloom; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; drinking water; gas chromatography; mass spectrometry; maximum likelihood analysis; odor; planktonic foraminifera; RNA; Viet Nam; Chroococcales; Cyanobacteria; environmental samples (Cyanobacteria); Oscillatoria","","","Funding text 1: This study was found by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under grant number “KHCBSS.02/19–21”.

Among these nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus are two of the most important harmful cyanobacterial bloom (HCB) drivers. A reliable prediction of these parameters, therefore, is necessary for the management of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. The aim of this study is to test the suitability of the powerful machine learning (ML) algorithm, random forest (RF), to provide information on water quality parameters for the Tri An Reservoir (TAR). Three species of nitrogen and phosphorus, including nitrite (N-NO<inf>2</inf>−), nitrate (N-NO<inf>3</inf>−), and phosphate (P-PO<inf>4</inf>3−), were empirically estimated using the field observation dataset (2009–2014) of six surrogates of total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<inf>5</inf>). Field data measurement showed that water quality in the TAR was eutrophic with an up-trend of N-NO<inf>3</inf>− and P-PO<inf>4</inf>3− during the study period. The RF regression model was reliable for N-NO<inf>2</inf>−, N-NO<inf>3</inf>−, and P-PO<inf>4</inf>3− prediction with a high R2 of 0.812–0.844 for the training phase (2009–2012) and 0.888–0.903 for the validation phase (2013–2014). The results of land use and land cover change (LUCC) revealed that deforestation and shifting agriculture in the upper region of the basin were the major factors increasing nutrient loading in the TAR. Among the meteorological parameters, rainfall pattern was found to be one of the most influential factors in eutrophication, followed by average sunshine hour. Our results are expected to provide an advanced assessment tool for predicting nutrient loading and for giving an early warning of HCB in the TAR. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Harmful cyanobacterial blooms; Random forest; Tri An eutrophic reservoir; Water quality","Agricultural robots; Biochemical oxygen demand; Decision trees; Deforestation; Dissolved oxygen; Eutrophication; Forecasting; Land use; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Regression analysis; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); River pollution; Surface waters; Tar; Water quality; Electrical conductivity; Environmental problems; Field data measurements; Land use and land cover change; Meteorological parameters; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Total dissolved solids; Water quality parameters; Machine learning; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; phosphate; phosphorus; algorithm; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; eutrophic environment; machine learning; reservoir; water quality; agriculture; algal bloom; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; concentration (parameter); controlled study; deforestation; electric conductivity; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; meteorological parameters; meteorology; nonhuman; nutrient; prediction; random forest; regression analysis; reliability; sunshine hour; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; Viet Nam; water analysis; water supply; environmental monitoring; Tri An Reservoir; Cyanobacteria; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Vietnam; Water Quality","","nitrate, 14797-55-8; nitrite, 14797-65-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Nitrogen; Phosphorus","This study was mainly granted by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) under grant number “KHCBSS.02/19-21”, and in part by the International Foundation for Science (IFS) under grant number “I-2-A-6054-1”.","Water Vital for Viet Nams Future, (2009); Belgiu, Mariana, Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 114, pp. 24-31, (2016); Berrendero Gómez, Esther, Nitrogen fixation in a non-heterocystous cyanobacterial mat from a mountain river, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Bi, Wuxia, Evolution characteristics of surface water quality due to climate change and LUCC under scenario simulations: A case study in the Luanhe River Basin, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 8, (2018); Blix, Katalin, Machine learning automatic model selection algorithm for oceanic chlorophyll-a content retrieval, Remote Sensing, 10, 5, (2018); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Bresciani, Mariano, Mapping phytoplankton blooms in deep subalpine lakes from Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8, Hydrobiologia, 824, 1, pp. 197-214, (2018); Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (1992); Brito, David, Assessing water and nutrient long-term dynamics and loads in the Enxoé temporary river basin (southeast Portugal), Water (Switzerland), 11, 2, (2019); Bui, Ha Manh, Prediction of cyanobacterial blooms in the Dau Tieng Reservoir using an artificial neural network, Marine and Freshwater Research, 68, 11, pp. 2070-2080, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","15732959; 01676369","","EMASD","33241485","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096559672"

Systematic studies determined the optimum parameters of the separation, including the optimum concentrations of the mixture of the primary amine (N1923) and tertiary amine (tri-n-octyl amine), the optimum acidity (pH) of the feed liquor (Yen Phu xenotime leachate), the optimum contact time between phases for extraction, scrubbing and stripping processes, and the most suitable stripping reagent mixture. Using the optimum parameters, the optimum stage number and phase volumetric ratio for extraction, scrubbing, and stripping processes were calculated using the calculus method based on the law of matter conservation. The flow rates of both phases for extraction, scrubbing, and stripping were determined from the results of these studies and calculations. To optimize the separation of uranium and thorium from the Yen Phu xenotime leachate, counter-current simulations of extraction, scrubbing and stripping were done in a series of mixer-settler units. The results indicated that the selective separation of Th and U with almost no loss of rare earths (REs) and a minimal contamination of iron were obtained. The continuous countercurrent extraction-scrubbing-stripping technique shows potential applications in the commercial separation of Th and U from RE leachate after tests using a sequence of mixer-settler units on a pilot scale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amine extractants; Continuous countercurrent extraction; Rare earths; Scrubbing; Stripping; Thorium; Uranium","Calculations; Leaching; Mixers (machinery); Mixtures; Rare earths; Solvent extraction; Thorium; Uranium; Counter current; Counter-current extractions; Optimum concentration; Optimum parameters; Selective separation; Stripping process; Systematic study; Volumetric ratio; Amines","","","Funding text 1: Dr. Nguyen Trong Hung expresses his sincere gratitude and thanks to the authorities of VINATOM and MOST .

However, elements of its biodiversity remain unclear and highly threatened. In this context, the assessment of rare species is a starting point to develop effective strategies for the conservation of entire ecosystems. In this paper, we report upon cryptic amphibolid gastropods in Vietnamese mangrove forests from the Mekong Delta. The snail fauna in the mangrove forests was previously known from published literature and three museum specimens as three amphibolid species, ‘Amphibola’ burmana, A. quadrasi, Salinator fragilis and ‘S.’ quadrasi. We investigated the identities of such snails using molecular and morphological methods. The amphibolids found in this survey were identified to belong to the genus Naranjia, new for Vietnam fauna. In addition, our phylogenetic analyses suggested that the Vietnamese amphibolids were the same species as Naranjia sp. reported from Thailand, and the amphibolids have both genetic and morphological polymorphisms within the population. These findings add to the great biodiversity of Vietnamese mangrove forests and mudflats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","article; biodiversity; fauna; forest; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; information center; mangrove; nonhuman; phylogeny; snail; Thailand; Viet Nam; animal; Bayes theorem; environmental protection; genetics; geography; physiology; species difference; wetland; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Geography; Phylogeny; Snails; Species Specificity; Vietnam; Wetlands","","","This study was funded by the Far East Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences Grant Number 17-007 and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology Grant Number VAST.HTQT.NGA.01/17-18 and Grant-in-Aid for Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellow Grant Number 16J04692, 19J00392, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 18H02506 and 20K15866.","A Study on Aid to the Environment Sector in Vietnam, (1999); Myers, Norman, Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities, Nature, 403, 6772, pp. 853-858, (2000); Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, (2005); Status and Management of Tropical Coastal Fisheries in Asia Iclarm Conf Proc 53 208p, (1997); Ng, Peter K.L., The state of marine biodiversity in the South China Sea, Raffles Bulletin of Zoology, 48, 8 SUPPL., pp. 3-7, (2000); Reefs at Risk in Southeast Asia, (2002); An International Perspective on Wetland Rehabilitation, (1999); Potential for Mangrove Carbon Projects in Vietnam, (2011); Veettil, Bijeesh Kozhikkodan, Mangroves of Vietnam: Historical development, current state of research and future threats, Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 218, pp. 212-236, (2019); Mangroves of the Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve Viet Nam, (2012)","","Nature Research subscriptions@nature.com","","","","","","20452322","","","33127930","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094679762"

In this study, in order to overcome the above shortcomings, a novel bench-scale suspension plant using a magnetorheological elastomer (MRE)-based absorber accompanied with an adaptive and global neural-network-based tracking controller is introduced. The adaptive neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the uncertain dynamics of the quarter-car model. The novel scheme consists of three parts, including a conventional ANN controller dominating the active region of neurons, a robust controller serving as a temporary controller to pull back the state into the active region when the neural approximation falls outside, and a switch to be used to monitor the activation of the neural part and switch the control authority between the above two controllers. The controller ensures that a globally uniform ultimate boundedness can be achieved. Furthermore, an auxiliary design system was added to the controller in order to deal with the effects of input constraints, and the state was analyzed for the tracking of the stabilization. The control scheme ensures that the output of the system converges to the vicinity of a reference trajectory and all the signals are globally, uniformly, and ultimately bounded. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively suppress the vibrations of the semiactive quarter car. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Automobile suspensions; Controllers; Elastomers; Model automobiles; Neural networks; Suspensions (components); Adaptive neural network controller; Adaptive neural networks; Control authorities; Magnetorheological elastomers; Reference trajectories; Semi active suspension; Stability and tracking; Uniform ultimate boundedness; Adaptive control systems","","","Acknowledgements.

The fiber matrix is considered as an external field to reconfigure a nanoparticle assembly. We find that the heating process tunes particle-particle and fiber-particle interactions, which alter adsorption of nanoparticles on fiber surfaces or clustering in pore spaces. Thus, it is possible to control the nanoparticle self-assembly by laser illumination. Gold nanoparticles strongly absorb radiations and efficiently dissipate absorbed energy into heat. By solving the heat transfer equation associated with an effective medium approximation, we calculate the spatial temperature rise. Remarkably, our theoretical results quantitatively agree with prior experiments. This indicates that we can ignore plasmonic coupling effects induced by particle clustering. Effects of the laser spot size and intensity on the photothermal heating are also discussed.

However, it has not received enough attention in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), i.e., the world’s third largest delta, compared to salinity intrusion and flooding. There have been several studies examining RB and coastal erosion in the VMD using remotely sensed satellite data, but the applied methodology was not adequately validated. Therefore, we developed a novel SRBED (Spectral RB Erosion Detection) method, in which the M-AMERL (Modified Automated Method for Extracting Rivers and Lakes) is proposed, and a new RB change detection algorithm using Landsat data. The results show that NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) using the M-AMERL algorithm (i.e., NDWI<inf>M-AMERL</inf>, MNDWI<inf>M-AMERL</inf>) perform better than other indices. Furthermore, the NDWI<inf>M-AMERL; SMA</inf> (i.e., NDWI<inf>M-AMERL</inf> using the SMA (Spectral Mixture Analysis) algorithm) is the best RB extraction method in the VMD. The NDWI<inf>M-AMERL; SMA</inf> performs better than the MNDWI, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and WNDWI (Weighted Normalized Difference Water Index) indices by 35–41%, 70% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, the NDVI index is not recommended for assessing RB changes in the delta. Applying the developed SRBED method and RB change detection algorithm, we estimated a net erosion area of the RB of –1.5 km2 from 2008 to 2014 in the Tien River from Tan Chau to My Thuan, with a mean erosion width of –2.64 m and maximum erosion widths exceeding 60 m in places. Our advanced method can be applied in other river deltas having similar characteristics, and the results from our study are helpful in future studies in the VMD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Landsat; Remote sensing; River bank detection/extraction; Satellite; Spectral index; Vietnamese Mekong Delta","Banks (bodies of water); Erosion; Signal detection; Change detection algorithms; Erosion detection; Extraction method; Landsat satellite; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference water index; Salinity intrusion; Spectral mixture analysis; Rivers","","","Funding: This research was funded by Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), the Supporting Program for Interaction-Based Initiative Team Studies SPIRITS 2016 of Kyoto University, and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) projects, grant numbers of VAST05.05/19-20 and KHCBTÐ.02/18-20.","Anthony, Edward Jamal, Linking rapid erosion of the Mekong River delta to human activities, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); van Khanh Triet, Nguyen, Has dyke development in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta shifted flood hazard downstream?, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 21, 8, pp. 3991-4010, (2017); Journal of Japan Society of Civil Engineers Ser B1 Hydraulic Engineering, (2018); Binh, Doan Van, Changes to long-term discharge and sediment loads in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta caused by upstream dams, Geomorphology, 353, (2020); Khoi, Dao Nguyen, Morphological change assessment from intertidal to river-dominated zones using multiple-satellite imagery: A case study of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Regional Studies in Marine Science, 34, (2020); Li, Xing, Recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and the impacts of dams, Earth-Science Reviews, 175, pp. 1-17, (2017); Wang, Jianjun, Sediment load estimates and variations in the Lower Mekong River, River Research and Applications, 27, 1, pp. 33-46, (2011); Tran, D.

It is widely applied in many fields with high dimensional data, including natural language processing and image recognition. High dimensional data can lead to problems in machine learning, such as overfitting and degradation of accuracy. To address these issues, some methods were proposed to reduce dimensions of the data and computational complexity simultaneously. The drawback of these methods is that they only work well on data distributed on the plane. In the case of the data distributed on the hyper-sphere, such as objects moving in space, the processing results are not so good as expected. Purpose: The use of Conformal Geometric Algebra in order to extract features and simultaneously reduce the dimensionality of a dataset for human activity recognition using Recurrent Neural Network. Results: Human activity data in a 3-dimensional coordinate system is pre-processed and normalized by calculating deviations from the mean coordinate. Next, the data is transformed to vectors in Conformal Geometric Algebra space and its dimensions are reduced to return the feature vectors. Finally, we use the Recurrent Neural Network model to train feature vectors. Empirical results performed on the Motion Capture dataset with eight actions show that the Conformal Geometric Algebra combined with Recurrent Neural Network can give the best test results of 92.5 %. Practical relevance: In human actions, some actions such as jump or dance will not move in motion and other actions, such as run, walk, will move in space. Therefore, we need a method to standardize actions. In the case of the data distributed on the hyper-sphere, the developed method can help us to extract features and simultaneously reduce the dimensionality of a dataset for human activity recognition using Recurrent Neural Network. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activity recognition; Conformal Geometric Algebra; Deep Learning; Principal Components Analysis","","","","This work was supported by The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology, code number of Project T2019-02-20.","Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python, (2017); International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering Ijrte, (2020); Pham, Cong Thang, Multi-quadratic dynamic programming procedure of edge-preserving denoising for medical images, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 40, 5W6, pp. 101-106, (2015); Deep Learning, (2015); Liu, Hailong, Feature extraction and pattern recognition for human motion by a deep sparse autoencoder, pp. 173-181, (2014); Ji, Shuiwang, 3D Convolutional neural networks for human action recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35, 1, pp. 221-231, (2013); Du, Yong, Hierarchical recurrent neural network for skeleton based action recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 07-12-June-2015, pp. 1110-1118, (2015); On the Difficulty of Training Recurrent Neural Networks, (2013); Principal Component Analysis, (2002); A Tutorial on Principal Components Analysis, (2002)","","Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation","","","","","","25418610; 16848853","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096069577"

The solar cell is classified into three main types: i) solar cells based on bulk silicon materials (monocrystalline, polycrystalline), ii) thin-film solar cells (CIGS, CdTe, DSSC, etc.), and iii) solar cells based on nanostructures and nanomaterials. Nowadays, commercial solar cells are usually made by bulk silicon material, which requires not only high fabrication costs but also limited performance. In this study, the fabrication of high-performance solar cells based on hybrid structure of silicon nanowires/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/graphene (SiNW/PEDOT:PSS/Gr) is focused upon. SiNWs with different lengths of 125, 400, 800 nm, and 2 µm are fabricated by a metal-assisted chemical etching method, and their influence on the performance of the hybrid solar cells is studied and investigated. The experimental results indicate that the suitable SiNW length for the fabrication of the hybrid solar cells is about 400 nm and the best power conversion efficiency obtained is about 9.05%, which is about 2.1 times higher than that of the planar Si solar cell. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","conversion efficiencies; hybrid solar cells; PEDOT:PSS; silicon nanowires","","","","This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 104.06‐2018.34 and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under project ĐLTE00.03/19‐20.","Sarkın, Ali Samet, A review of anti-reflection and self-cleaning coatings on photovoltaic panels, Solar Energy, 199, pp. 63-73, (2020); Goel, Nipun, A review of nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collectors: Design considerations and experiments with hybrid PV/Thermal and direct steam generation collectors, Renewable Energy, 145, pp. 903-913, (2020); Sahoo, Mihir Kumar, Integration of silicon nanowires in solar cell structure for efficiency enhancement: A review, Journal of Materiomics, 5, 1, pp. 34-48, (2019); Khang, Dahlyoung, Recent progress in Si-PEDOT:PSS inorganic-organic hybrid solar cells, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 52, 50, (2019); Tian, Bozhi, Coaxial silicon nanowires as solar cells and nanoelectronic power sources, Nature, 449, 7164, pp. 885-889, (2007); Yuan, Guangbi, Understanding the origin of the low performance of chemically grown silicon nanowires for solar energy conversion, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 50, 10, pp. 2334-2338, (2011); Garnett, Erik Christian, Silicon nanowire radial p-n junction solar cells, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 130, 29, pp. 9224-9225, (2008); Sci Rep, (2015); Yoon, Sung-soo, Ag nanowire/PEDOT:PSS bilayer transparent electrode for high performance Si-PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells, Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, 129, pp. 128-132, (2019); Rui, Yunjun, Improved Performance of Silicon Nanowire-Based Solar Cells with Diallyl Disulfide Passivation, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 123, 8, pp. 4664-4673, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","20566646","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119504658"

Moreover, they are recognized as highly productive ecosystems in providing nutrients to mangrove food webs or exporting them to nearby coastal waters. In the present study, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were applied to examine the changes in the diets of benthic invertebrate communities following mangrove restoration. The isotope signature of invertebrate tissues varied among the forest ages and locations and ranged from 3.7 ± 1.0 to 13.9 ± 1.1%↑ and -26.6 ± 0.5 to -15.0 ± 0.4%↑ for δ15N and δ13C, respectively. The results showed that the food source assimilation of macro-invertebrates is slightly altered from a mixture of benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton in the mudflat to a combination of benthic microalgae and sediment organic matter in the Sonneratia caseolaris and the Kandelia obovata forests. Therefore, the diets of macro-invertebrates varied following forest ages and the position of the forest in the intertidal zone.

TCS and TCC were measured in 89 dust samples collected from bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens of private houses in four northern cities including Hanoi, Bac Ninh, Hung Yen, and Nam Dinh, by means of liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of TCS and TCC ranged from <5 to 1090 (median 33.2) and from <3 to 531 (median 19.3) ng g−1, respectively. Concentrations of TCS and TCC in the kitchen and bedroom dusts were markedly higher than levels found in the living room samples, probably due to their applications in kitchen utensils, household cleaning reagents, and personal care products. A strong positive correlation between TCS and TCC concentrations was detected in the whole dataset (R2 = 0.810, p < 0.001). For samples in which both TCS and TCC were quantified, TCS/TCC ratios ranged from 0.3 to 12 with a median value of 1.8, and did not show big differences between micro-environments. Human exposures to TCS and TCC through dust ingestion were estimated for various age groups with 95% CI daily intake doses ranging from (0.032–0.070) to (0.340–0.740) and from (0.017–0.033) to (0.175–0.345) ng kg-bw−1 d−1 for adults and infants respectively. Although our derived values were much lower than reference doses, more comprehensive risk assessment considering multiple exposure pathways of TCS and TCC is needed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human exposure; Indoor dust; Northern Vietnam; Triclocarban; Triclosan","Kitchens; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Risk assessment; Comprehensive risks; Dietary exposure; Microenvironments; Multiple exposure; Personal care products; Positive correlations; Spatial variability; Tandem mass spectrometry; Dust; domestic chemical; triclocarban; triclosan; carbanilide derivative; assessment method; concentration (composition); dust; indoor air; pollution exposure; surfactant; adult; age; ambient air; Article; Belgium; Canada; China; concentration (parameter); correlation analysis; environmental exposure; home environment; human; infant; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; microenvironment; priority journal; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; Southeast Asia; Spain; United States; Viet Nam; city; Adult; Carbanilides; Cities; Humans; Infant; Triclosan; Vietnam","","triclocarban, 101-20-2; triclosan, 3380-34-5; Carbanilides; Dust; triclocarban; Triclosan","This research is funded by the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under project number QG.19.17 .","Allmyr, Mats, Triclosan in plasma and milk from Swedish nursing mothers and their exposure via personal care products, Science of the Total Environment, 372, 1, pp. 87-93, (2006); Allmyr, Mats, The influence of age and gender on triclosan concentrations in Australian human blood serum, Science of the Total Environment, 393, 1, pp. 162-167, (2008); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in plastic products, indoor dust, sediment and fish from informal e-waste recycling sites in Vietnam: a comprehensive assessment of contamination, accumulation pattern, emissions, and human exposure, Environmental Geochemistry and Health, 39, 4, pp. 935-954, (2017); Hoang, Anhquoc, A preliminary investigation of 942 organic micro-pollutants in the atmosphere in waste processing and urban areas, northern Vietnam: Levels, potential sources, and risk assessment, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 167, pp. 354-364, (2019); Hoang, Anhquoc, Comprehensive analysis of 942 organic micro-pollutants in settled dusts from northern Vietnam: pollution status and implications for human exposure, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 21, 1, pp. 57-66, (2019); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their methylated derivatives in settled dusts from end-of-life vehicle processing, urban, and rural areas, northern Vietnam: Occurrence, source apportionment, and risk assessment, Science of the Total Environment, 672, pp. 468-478, (2019); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polyurethane foam-based passive air sampling for simultaneous determination of POP- and PAH-related compounds: A case study in informal waste processing and urban areas, northern Vietnam, Chemosphere, 247, (2020); Ao, Junjie, Identification, characteristics and human exposure assessments of triclosan, bisphenol-A, and four commonly used organic UV filters in indoor dust collected from Shanghai, China, Chemosphere, 184, pp. 575-583, (2017); Asimakopoulos, Alexandros G., Widespread occurrence of bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers, p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters (parabens), benzophenone type-UV filters, triclosan, and triclocarban in human urine from Athens, Greece, Science of the Total Environment, 470-471, pp. 1243-1249, (2014); Bedoux, Gilles, Occurrence and toxicity of antimicrobial triclosan and by-products in the environment, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 19, 4, pp. 1044-1065, (2012)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00489697; 18791026","","STEVA","32413620","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084370210"

In this work, both adiabatic and isothermal crack surfaces are considered. Asymptotic solutions-based enriched functions are incorporated into the approximation scheme to mathematically capture jump across crack surfaces of both the temperature and displacements, as well as the singularities of heat fluxes and stresses in the vicinity of crack tip. Once the stress intensity factors (SIFs) are evaluated, the direction of crack growth can be determined. The meshfree analysis is based on radial point interpolation method (RPIM), in which Cartesian transformation method (CTM) is adopted for numerical integration, instead of the conventional Gaussian quadrature. The utilization of Gaussian scheme requires background cells in shape of quadrilaterals or triangles. In contrast, the CTM is advantageous in the manner that the background cells are no longer required, leading to truly meshfree formulation. The novel contribution of the current work is the extension of CTM scheme in which the integration domain is updated according to crack growth. The crack surfaces are viewed as part of the boundaries of the problem domain. Therefore, it is guaranteed that no discontinuities exist within the domain. The accuracy of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparison of computed results with reference ones from analytical solution, and other existing numerical methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cartesian transformation method; Crack growth; Fracture; Meshfree; Numerical integration; Thermo-elasticity","Integration; Numerical methods; Stress intensity factors; Asymptotic solutions; Cartesian transformations; Crack growth analysis; Crack growth simulation; Mesh-free particle methods; Numerical integration scheme; Numerical integrations; Radial point interpolation method; Crack tips","","","This work is funded by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology - VNU-HCM under grand number T-KHUD-2018-87 .

However, the information of PM<inf>0.1</inf> that is needed to fully evaluate its influence on human health and environment is still scarce in many developing countries. This is a comprehensive study on the levels, chemical compositions, and source apportionment of PM<inf>0.1</inf> conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam. Twenty-four-hour samples of PM<inf>0.1</inf> were collected during the dry season (November to December 2015) at a mixed site to get the information on mass concentrations and chemical compositions. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to investigate the simultaneous influence of meteorological factors on fluctuations in the daily levels of PM<inf>0.1</inf>. Multiple linear regression models could explain about 50% of the variations of PM<inf>0.1</inf> concentrations, in which wind speed is the most important variable. The average concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble ions (Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Na+, NH<inf>4</inf>+, Cl−, NO<inf>3</inf>−, SO<inf>4</inf>2−, C<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>2−), and elements (Be, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl, Pb, Na, Fe, Mg, K, and Ca) were 2.77 ± 0.90 μg m−3, 0.63 ± 0.28 μg m−3, 0.88 ± 0.39 μg m−3, and 0.05 ± 0.02 μg m−3, accounting for 51.23 ± 9.32%, 11.22 ± 2.10%, 16.28 ± 2.67%, and 1.11 ± 0.94%, respectively. A positive matrix factorization model revealed the contributions of five major sources to the PM<inf>0.1</inf> mass including traffic (gasoline and diesel emissions, 46.28%), secondary emissions (31.18%), resident/commerce (12.23%), industry (6.05%), and road/construction (2.92%). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hanoi; Nanoparticles; PM0.1; PMF; Source apportionment","ambient air; chemical analysis; chemical composition; concentration (composition); developing world; elemental carbon; industrial emission; nanoparticle; particulate matter; source apportionment; traffic emission; wind velocity; Hanoi; Viet Nam; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Nanoparticles; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions; Vietnam","","Air Pollutants; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions","Funding text 1: This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2019-24-01/HĐ-KHCN.

The effect of the solution concentration ranging from 0.15 M to 0.30 M was examined. We observed that the CuO thin films were single phase, polycrystalline with monoclinic crystal structure and were oriented along planes, such as (110), (-111), (111) and (-202). The micrographs of the scanning electron microscopy were observed to verify that the grain size of the CuO thin films increased with increases in the solution concentration. In addition, the CuO thin films showed a minimum resistivity of 0.0359 Ωcm, corresponding to the solution concentration of 0.30 M. Finally, the thin film transistors using the solution-processed CuO channel exhibited a p-type operation, with an on/off current ratio of approximately 102-103, and saturated field-effect mobility of approximately 10−4 cm2V−1s−1. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cupric oxide; Oxide semiconductor; p-type; Solution process; Thin film transistor","Copper oxides; Crystal structure; Field effect transistors; Oxide films; Scanning electron microscopy; Substrates; Thin film circuits; Thin film transistors; Field-effect mobilities; Glass substrates; Monoclinic crystal structure; ON/OFF current ratio; P type semiconductor; Solution concentration; Solution-processed; Solution-processing; Thin films","","","Funding: This work has been supported by the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU), under Project No. QG.19.02.","Alshammari, Fwzah H., Enhanced ZnO thin-film transistor performance using bilayer gate dielectrics, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 8, 35, pp. 22751-22755, (2016); Yang, Yu, Annealing time modulated the film microstructures and electrical properties of P-type CuO field effect transistors, Applied Surface Science, 481, pp. 632-636, (2019); Oh, Byeong-yun, High-performance ZnO thin-film transistor fabricated by atomic layer deposition, Semiconductor Science and Technology, 26, 8, (2011); Nayak, Pradipta K., High performance In2O3 thin film transistors using chemically derived aluminum oxide dielectric, Applied Physics Letters, 103, 3, (2013); Sanctis, Shawn, Toward an Understanding of Thin-Film Transistor Performance in Solution-Processed Amorphous Zinc Tin Oxide (ZTO) Thin Films, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 9, 25, pp. 21328-21337, (2017); Cheng, Huachi, Flexible a-IZO thin film transistors fabricated by solution processes, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 507, 1, pp. L1-L3, (2010); Ma, Pengfei, Low voltage operation of IGZO thin film transistors enabled by ultrathin Al2O3 gate dielectric, Applied Physics Letters, 112, 2, (2018); Yao, Zhiqiang, Room temperature fabrication of p-channel Cu 2O thin-film transistors on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates, Applied Physics Letters, 101, 4, (2012); Matsuzaki, Kosuke, Epitaxial growth of high mobility Cu2 O thin films and application to p -channel thin film transistor, Applied Physics Letters, 93, 20, (2008); Sung, Sang-yun, Fabrication of p-channel thin-film transistors using CuO active layers deposited at low temperature, Applied Physics Letters, 97, 22, (2010)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00406090","","THSFA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083294542"

Nowadays, one of the innovated technologies applied to bond nonwoven fabrics is the ultrasonic welding method, due to the advantages afforded by its clean, fast, and reliable approach. In this work, isotactic polypropylene (PP) nonwoven fabrics were bonded by a continuous ultrasonic welding process. In order to consider the influence of the roller on the formation of welding joints and their mechanical properties, different roller profiles were designed, fabricated, and tested. Eight types of roller profiles corresponding to No. 1-No. 8 in the experiments were divided into four groups. After bonding, the microstructure in a typical case (i.e., No. 1) was captured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the formation of the welding joints. Additionally, the load and the peel strength of the welding joints of all eight roller profiles were analyzed. The results showed that no welding defects, such as cracks or blowholes, were visible in the melted zone. The load depended on the area ratio(s) of the welding area (S<inf>0</inf>) to the cycling area (S<inf>1</inf>).

This study describes the first application of the Hyperpipes (HP) algorithm for the development of the five novel ensemble models that combine the HP algorithm and the AdaBoost (AB), Bagging (B), Dagging, Decorate, and Real AdaBoost (RAB) ensemble techniques for mapping the spatial variability of landslide susceptibility in the Nam Dan commune, Ha Giang province, Vietnam. Information on 76 historical landslides and ten geo-environmental factors (slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index, curvature, weathering crust, geology, river density, fault density, and distance from roads) were used for the construction of the training and validation datasets that are the prerequisites for building and testing the proposed models. Using different performance metrics (i.e., the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), negative predictive value, positive predictive value, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, root mean square error, and Kappa), we verified the proficiency of all five ensemble learning techniques in increasing the fitness and predictive powers of the base HP model. Based on the AUC values derived from the models, the ensemble ABHP model that yielded an AUC value of 0.922 was identified as the most efficient model for mapping the landslide susceptibility in the Nam Dan commune, followed by RABHP (AUC = 0.919), BHP (AUC = 0.909), Dagging-HP (AUC = 0.897), Decorate-HP (AUC = 0.865), and the single HP model (AUC = 0.856), respectively. The novel ensemble models proposed for the Nam Dan commune and the resultant susceptibility maps can aid land-use planners in the development of efficient mitigation strategies in response to destructive landslides. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AdaBoost; Bagging; Dagging; Decorate; Ensemble modeling; Machine learning; Real AdaBoost","","","","Funding text 1: This study was conducted within the implementation of research project VT-UD.05/18-20 funded by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST).

The dependence of important features, including thermal and fiery behavior, ionic conductivity and oxidative stability, on SL content as well as the compatibility with Na<inf>0.44</inf>MnO<inf>2</inf> cathode materials are essentially reported. It was revealed that the presence of a moderate SL amount effectively promotes the electrolyte safety profile while maintaining acceptable conductivity.

They also perform well when coupled with Na<inf>0.44</inf>MnO<inf>2</inf> cathode in coin-type half-cells. Discharge capacity values of around 85–95 mAh·g−1 (C/10 rate), with almost 100% capacity retention after 20 cycles and good rate capability were demonstrated.

X-ray diffraction analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed multi-scale defects in the materials. A nanoscale secondary Ga<inf>2</inf>Zn<inf>9</inf>O<inf>12</inf> spinel phase, mesoscale grain boundaries, and atomic-scale lattice defects were detected. The lattice defects included oxygen vacancies, zinc vacancies, and complex defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy and Doppler broadening spectroscopy provided evidence of interactions between charge carriers and defects sites, which explained the low thermal conductivities of the IGZO materials (κ<inf>total</inf> ≈ 3.9 W/mK) at 773 K.

The materials are commonly synthesized via solvothermal reaction between Hf or Zr salts and organic linkers, however this method requires elongated reaction time as well as results in heterogeneous particles and low yield, which leads to the difficulty for nano MOF synthesis. To overcome these disadvantages, we applied microwave method to enhance the synthetic efficiency and control particle homogeneity of nano UiO-66 framework. The nano MOFs, named Hf-UiO-66 and Zr-UiO-66, with highly homogeneous nanoparticles, very small sizes and high yields could be formed under microwave irradiation within a few minutes. According to the results from XRD, SEM, N<inf>2</inf> isotherm sorption, and TGA characterizations, the materials exhibited similar porosity and structure compared to the original framework. Additionally, Hf-UiO-66 and Zr-UiO-66 showed high efficiency for the treatment of curcumin's overdose by adsorbing the drug from aqueous solution with a maximum adsorption capacity up to 463.02 and 466.39 mg g−1, respectively, higher than reported Zr-UiO-66 (393.22 mg g−1). Moreover, the adsorption mechanisms were revealed that the adsorption of curcumin (CUR) by UiO-66 was influenced by defect sites in the MOF structure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption mechanism; Curcumin; Drug removal; Highly efficient adsorption; Microwave-assisted synthesis; Nano metal-organic framework","Adsorption; Efficiency; Microwave irradiation; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Porous materials; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption mechanism; Curcumin; Heterogeneous particles; Homogeneous nanoparticles; Microwave assisted synthesis; Solvothermal reactions; Synthetic efficiency; Metal-Organic Frameworks","","","Funding text 1: We are thankful to financial the support from Viet Nam National University, Ho Chi Minh City under grant No. VNU-A-562-2018-50-01.

Generally, to overcome this issue, strong ground motions recorded at other places around the world are used, which have similar seismic, tectonic and physical earthquake characteristics, such as earthquake magnitude, source model, distance to the source, tectonic geological conditions, and soil conditions. However due to different path effects and site effect, if applied to the site-specific studies in Vietnam, the above approach would generate certain errors. Therefore, it is important to obtain strong ground motion data that are applicable for seismic design of constructions in a particular region. Especially, it is important to adhere to strict seismic design requirements for facilities, such as hydropower, thermal, and nuclear power plants. One of the most interesting solutions is the theory of simulating the waveforms of strong earthquakes commonly known as the empirical Green’s function. The empirical Green’s function is a useful tool for estimating the ground motions produced by large earthquakes using small earthquake records. The basic idea of the method is that these small events data already incorporate the information of the propagation path and the local site effects. Ground-motion simulations essentially use these small events as an empirical Green’s function and add them following the scaling law based on the omega-square model. In this article, we simulate design basis ground motion for the Song Tranh 2 hydropower dam as an example. We have applied the empirical Green’s function method to predict broadband ground-motion time histories for several M5.5, one M5.7, and one M5.9 earthquake scenarios at the dam site based on M4.6 observed ground motions without/with considering radiation pattern corrections. The results confirm that strong ground-motion simulations are applicable to seismic hazard assessment in Vietnam. Once we obtain accurate source parameters, the site-specific synthetic ground motions of the earthquake scenarios can be used for seismic design safety in Vietnam. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Broadband ground motion simulation; earthquake scenario; empirical green’s function method; hydropower dam","Earthquake effects; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Seismic design; Tectonics; Earthquake magnitudes; Ground motion prediction; Ground-motion simulation; Low to moderate seismicity; S-function simulation; Seismic hazard assessment; Seismic resistant design; Synthetic ground motions; Motion estimation; computer simulation; earthquake prediction; empirical analysis; Green function; ground motion; numerical model; seismic hazard; source parameters; Viet Nam","","","The earthquake data and geological data is provided by Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (ĐTĐL.2012-G/57).

In this report, we describe an approach for fabricating a new hybrid material by coupling a gold nanorod (Au NR) core and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoS<inf>x</inf>) shell. The Au NR/MoS<inf>x</inf> core-shell structure is achieved by exploiting the hot electrons generated in the plasmonic excitation of Au NRs to drive the reduction of [MoS<inf>4</inf>]2-, which is pre-adsorbed on the Au NR surface, producing a thin MoS<inf>x</inf> layer. This approach allows us to control the thickness of the MoS<inf>x</inf> coating layer on the Au NR surface. The resultant Au NR/MoS<inf>x</inf> hybrid is characterized by absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping, x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","core shell nanostructures; gold nanorods; molybdenum sulfide; photo-induced deposition","Absorption spectroscopy; Energy conversion; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Gold Nanorods; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hot electrons; Hybrid materials; Molybdenum compounds; Nanorods; Plasmonics; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); Sulfur compounds; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Core shell nano structures; Core shell structure; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Hybrid nanostructures; Molybdenum sulfide; Plasmonic nanostructures; Reduction process; Scanning electrons; Gold compounds","","","This work was funded by the National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) through the project 103.02-2016.24 and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology through the project L0000.03/19-21.","Gaillac, Romain, ELATE: An open-source online application for analysis and visualization of elastic tensors, Journal of Physics Condensed Matter, 28, 27, (2016); Varna, Mariana, In vivo uptake and cellular distribution of gold nanoshells in a preclinical model of xenografted human renal cancer, Gold Bulletin, 46, 4, pp. 257-265, (2013); Merced-Grafals, Emmanuelle J., Repeatable, accurate, and high speed multi-level programming of memristor 1T1R arrays for power efficient analog computing applications, Nanotechnology, 27, 36, (2016); Zeinabad, Hojjat Alizadeh, Ultrasensitive interdigitated capacitance immunosensor using gold nanoparticles, Nanotechnology, 29, 26, (2018); Wang, Xiaoli, Broadband spectral signature of the ultrafast transient optical response of gold nanorods, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 119, 13, pp. 7416-7427, (2015); Palpant, Bruno, Highly dispersive thermo-optical properties of gold nanoparticles, Applied Physics Letters, 90, 22, (2007); Ringe, Emilie, Plasmon length: A universal parameter to describe size effects in gold nanoparticles, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 3, 11, pp. 1479-1483, (2012); Su, Shao, Creating SERS hot spots on MoS2 nanosheets with in situ grown gold nanoparticles, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 6, 21, pp. 18735-18741, (2014); T Sreenivasan, Sreeprasad Theruvakkattil, Controlled, defect-guided, metal-nanoparticle incorporation onto MoS 2 via chemical and microwave routes: Electrical, thermal, and structural properties, Nano Letters, 13, 9, pp. 4434-4441, (2013); Li, Yuan, Au@MoS2 Core-Shell Heterostructures with Strong Light-Matter Interactions, Nano Letters, 16, 12, pp. 7696-7702, (2016)","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","","","","","09574484; 13616528","9780080964478","NNOTE","32301441","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084272390"

In addition, the limit of each analytical methodology constrains the approach as well as the usefulness of the results in geoscience applications. Here, we report the specific mineral characterization of RE-containing ores from Yen Phu mine, Vietnam, using a range of state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with microscopy: Mössbauer spectroscopy, infrared microspectroscopy, time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Because the distribution of each element in the deposit differs, such combinatorial works are necessary and could lead to more plausible answers to questions surrounding the point of origin of RE elements. The results of our Mössbauer spectroscopic analysis indicate that the three ores sampled at different locations all contain magnetite-like, hematite-like, and iron(III) salts other than hematite. In addition, we confirmed the presence of phosphate around the grain boundary in the magnetite-like mineral phase by infrared microspectroscopic analysis. The present analytical findings of trace amounts of europium(III) using TRLFS suggest that the europium ions generate identical luminescence spectra despite being embedded in three different matrices of iron minerals. This demonstration highlights the benefits of combinatorial spectroscopic analyses to gain insights into the effects of the environment of REs on their solid-state chemistry and shows the potential utility of TRLFS as a resource mining tool. Further applications of this approach in the analytical screening of rocks and minerals are feasible. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was financially supported by the bilateral project between JSPS and VAST by the Ministry project (code DTCB.11/19/VCNXH), VINATOM.

Binarizer is one of three main blocks in a CABAC architecture, where binary symbols (bins) are generated to feed the binary arithmetic encoder (BAE). The residual video data occupied an average of 75% of the CABAC’s work-load, thus its performance will significantly contribute to the overall performance of whole CABAC design. This paper proposes an efficient hardware implementation of a binarizer for CABAC that focuses on low area cost, low power consumption while still providing enough bins for high-throughput CABAC. On the average, the proposed design can process upto 3.5 residual syntax elements (SEs) per clock cycle at the maximum frequency of 500 MHz with an area cost of 9.45 Kgates (6.41 Kgates for the binarizer core) and power consumption of 0.239 mW (0.184 mW for the binarizer core) with NanGate 45 nm technology. It shows that our proposal achieved a high overhead-efficiency of 1.293 Mbins/Kgate/mW, much better than the other related high performance designs. In addition, our design also achieved a high power-efficiency of 8288 Mbins/mW; this is important factor for handheld applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CABAC; Hardware implementation; HEVC; Residual data binarization","","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This work is partly supported by Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under grant number QG.18.38 (LoPoSoC).; Funding text 2: This work is partly supported by Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under grant number QG.18.38 (LoPoSoC).","Bossen, Frank, HEVC complexity and implementation analysis, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 22, 12, pp. 1685-1696, (2012); Ohm, Jensrainer, Comparison of the coding efficiency of video coding standards-including high efficiency video coding (HEVC), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 22, 12, pp. 1669-1684, (2012); Sze, Vivienne, A comparison of CABAC throughput for HEVC/H.265 vs. AVC/H.264, IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems, SiPS: Design and Implementation, pp. 165-170, (2013); Vnu J Comput Sci Commun Eng, (2019); Peng, Bin, A hardware CABAC encoder for HEVC, Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, pp. 1372-1375, (2013); de Matos Alonso, Camila, Low-power HEVC Binarizer architecture for the CABAC block targeting UHD video processing, pp. 30-35, (2017); Livi Ramos, Fábio Luís, Residual syntax elements analysis and design targeting high-throughput HEVC CABAC, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, 67, 2, pp. 475-488, (2020); Zhou, Dajiang, Ultra-high-throughput VLSI architecture of H.265/HEVC CABAC encoder for UHDTV applications, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 25, 3, pp. 497-507, (2015); Livi Ramos, Fábio Luís, High-Throughput Binary Arithmetic Encoder using Multiple-Bypass Bins Processing for HEVC CABAC, Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2018-May, (2018); Saggiorato, Alessandro Via Piana, HEVC Residual Syntax Elements Generation Architecture for High-Throughput CABAC Design, pp. 193-196, (2018)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083902815"

Nevertheless, insights of their contribution to plant drought responses and associated regulatory mechanisms remain limited. Herein, a soybean response regulator (RR) gene RR34, which is the potential drought-responsive downstream member of a TCS, was ectopically expressed in the model plant Arabidopsis for the analysis of its biological roles in drought stress response. Results from the survival test revealed outstanding recovery ratios of 52%–53% in the examined transgenic lines compared with 28% of the wild-type plants. Additionally, remarkedly lower water loss rates in detached leaves as well as enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were observed in the transgenic group. Further transcriptional analysis of a subset of drought-responsive genes demonstrated higher expression in GmRR34-transgenic plants upon exposure to drought, including abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes NCED3, OST1, ABI5, and RAB18.

However, no TCP/NC enhancement work can get a high goodput performance in bi-directional packet loss environments, especially with a high degree and/or burst loss of ACK packets. Therefore, we propose a new scheme called TCP/NC with Bi-directional Loss Tolerance (TCP/NCwBLT) to maintain a goodput in a wide range of bi-directional loss environments by combining three techniques of 'ACK accumulation', 'ACK retransmission', and 'Duplicate ACK generator' at the source and/or the sink sides. The simulation results on ns-3 show that TCP/NCwBLT always outperforms the various TCPs and a recent variant of TCP/NC when packet losses happen in both directions, and its advantage significantly increases at a high ACK loss rate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ACK loss; bi-directional loss; burstiness loss; constrained-node networks; network coding; ns-3; TCP/NC","Packet loss; Transmission control protocol; Bi-directional; Burstiness; Duplicate ACKs; Goodput performance; Lossy networks; Retransmissions; TCP protocol; TCP/NC; Network coding","","","Manuscript received November 3, 2019; revised December 6, 2019; accepted December 10, 2019.

For this purpose, we employed a novel gradient-boosting regression technique called the extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) algorithm implemented and verified a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 121 sampling plots conducted during the dry season. The dataset fuses the data of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and the dual polarimetric (HH, HV) data of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The performance standards of the proposed model (root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coeffcient of determination (R2) were compared with those of other machine learning techniques, namely gradient boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forests regression (RFR). The XGBR model obtained a promising result with R2 = 0.805, RMSE = 28.13 Mg ha-1, and the model yielded the highest predictive performance among the five machine learning models. In the XGBR model, the estimated mangrove AGB ranged from 11 to 293 Mg ha1 (average = 106.93 Mg ha-1). This work demonstrates that XGBR with the combined Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data can accurately estimate the mangrove AGB in the Can Gio biosphere reserve. The general applicability of the XGBR model combined with multiple sourced optical and SAR data should be further tested and compared in a large-scale study of forest AGBs in different geographical and climatic ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Above-ground biomass; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Can Gio biosphere reserve; Extreme gradient boosting; Mangrove; Sentinel-2; Vietnam","Adaptive boosting; Biomass; Biospherics; Decision trees; Geophysical prospecting; Ground penetrating radar systems; Machine learning; Magnesium; Mean square error; Random forests; Support vector regression; Above ground biomass; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Biosphere reserve; Gradient boosting; Mangrove; Sentinel-2; Viet Nam; Forestry","","","This research received no external funding.

The theoretical calculations reveal correlations between temperature change and the optical power, laser spot, and thermal conductivity of dielectric layer in these systems. optical data storage, alternative cancer therapy, antibacterial activities, and radiative cooling. The incident light excites surface plasmons of metal\u2010like materials in photothermal agents and thus is effectively confined in the nanostructures. The confinement of electromagnetic waves causes strong light absorbance. The absorbed energy converts efficiently into heat. Manipulating the electron density or plasmonic structures in systems leads to an inhomogeneity of electric fields and generates local heat to match with desired purposes. Typically, photothermal applications have used noble metals because of their large concentration of free electrons and high efficiency of light\u2010to\u2010heat conversion. However, large inelastic losses of noble metals limit plasmon lifetimes in metal nanostructures and reduce service life of optical confinement. Photothermal effects have been of interest in efficient solar vapor generation, which strongly confines electromagnetic fields but provides relatively low loss. The optical and electrical properties of graphene can be easily tuned by doping, applying external fields, and injecting charge carriers. The small number of free electrons in graphene leads to occurance of plasmon resonance at the infrared regime and significantly reduces the heat dissipation compared with metals. Consequently, graphene\u2010based metamaterials are of interest and potentially display various intriguing behaviors. Graphene has been recently considered as a novel plasmonic material, There are several methods to investigate the performance of graphene\u2010based devices. Although experimental implementation is very expensive and simulation is time\u2010consuming, theoretical approaches are scalable and provide good insights into the physics underlying the design of metamaterials. Furthermore, the scalability is important in generating huge amount of data for machine learning and deep learning analyses. Thus, reliable theoretical models are useful for enhancing the highly accurate fabrications in both size and morphologies. These calculations allow us to determine roles of graphene plasmons on the light confinement and heat generation. In addition, the effects of dielectric layers on the temperature gradient are also discussed. In this work, we present a theoretical approach to calculate plasmonic properties of graphene\u2010based nanostructures and temperature distribution in the systems when irradiated by a mid\u2010infrared laser light. The systems are modeled to be similar to mid\u2010infrared graphene detectors fabricated by Guo et al. , composed of a square lattice of graphene nanodisks on a diamond\u2010like carbon thin film grown on a silicon substrate. The square lattice is characterized by a lattice period, Our graphene\u2010based systems, as shown in Figure a \u2009=\u2009270\u2009nm, a resonator size, D \u2009=\u2009210\u2009nm, and a number of graphene resonator layers, N . A thickness of the diamond\u2010like carbon layer is one can expect that this energy of diamond\u2010like carbon thin film has the same order. The value is higher than the phonon energy of SiO and other conventional substrates. Consequently, the surface of diamond\u2010like carbon films has a lower trap density which leads to be nonpolar and chemically inert surface. h \u2009=\u200960\u2009nm. Because the energy of optical phonon of the diamond is about 165\u2009meV, 2 (55\u2009meV) a) The top\u2010down view and b) the side view of graphene\u2010based system including structural parameters. To capture the effects of interactions between graphene resonators on the polarizability, the dipole approximation is used for simplicity. This approximation works well as When the size is much smaller than the wavelength of incident light, we can apply quasistatic approximation to analytically determine the polarizability of a single graphene resonator. a / We suppose that the accuracy is still acceptable for D \u2009\u2265\u20091.5. a / D \u2009\u2248\u20091.29 in our system, which describes the practical graphene detector in previous study. \u03B1 ( \u03C9 ) = \u03B5 1 + \u03B5 2 2 D 3 \u03B6 2 \u2212 i \u03C9 D \u03B5 1 + \u03B5 2 2 \u03C3 ( \u03C9 ) \u2212 1 \u03B7 where \u03B5 1 \u2009=\u20091, \u03B5 2 \u2009=\u20096.25, \u03B5 3 \u2009=\u200911.56; \u03C9 is frequency; and \u03B6 and \u03B7 are geometric parameters calculated using the lowest\u2010order dipole plasmon model. The analytical dependence of \u03B6 and \u03B7 on the morphology and thickness can be found in the study by Yu et al. According to the random\u2010phase approximation with zero\u2010parallel wave vector, the N \u2010layers graphene conductivity in mid\u2010infrared regime is \u03C3 ( \u03C9 ) = N e 2 i | E F | \u03C0 \u210F 2 ( \u03C9 + i \u03C4 \u2212 1 ) where e is the electron charge, \u210F is the reduced Planck constant, \u03C4 is the carrier relaxation time, and E F is a chemical potential. Typically, \u03C3 ( ignores contributions of interband transitions. The approximation is only valid in the low\u2010frequency regime. To effectively combine Equation and , it is necessary to require the strong coupling condition, where the spacing distance between graphene disks is much smaller than the diameter the vertical optical conductivity is ignored and the horizontal optical conductivity is simply additive. \u03C9 ) contains both interband and intraband transitions. However, in the mid\u2010infrared regime, the intraband conductivity is completely dominant. The in\u2010plane optical conductivity of graphene in Equation D . In addition, as graphene disk layers are separated by a dielectric layer, The reflection and transmission coefficient of the graphene\u2010based nanostructure are t 13 = t 12 t 23 e i ( \u03C9 c \u03B5 2 h ) 1 + r 12 r 23 e 2 i ( \u03C9 c \u03B5 2 h ) r 13 = r 12 + r 23 e 2 i ( \u03C9 c \u03B5 2 h ) 1 + r 12 r 23 e 2 i ( \u03C9 c \u03B5 2 h ) where r 0 = \u03B5 2 \u2212 \u03B5 1 \u03B5 2 + \u03B5 1 , \u2003 t 0 = 2 \u03B5 1 \u03B5 2 + \u03B5 1 r 12 = r 0 \u2212 i s ( 1 \u2212 r 0 ) \u03B1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03B3 , \u2003 t 12 = t 0 + i s t 0 \u03B1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03B3 r 23 = \u03B5 3 \u2212 \u03B5 22 \u03B5 3 + \u03B5 2 , \u2003 t 23 = 2 \u03B5 2 \u03B5 3 + \u03B5 2 s = 4 \u03C0 a 2 \u03C9 / c \u03B5 2 + \u03B5 1 , \u2003 \u03B3 \u2248 g a 3 2 \u03B5 1 + \u03B5 2 + i s where c is the speed of light, g \u2009\u2248\u20094.52 is the net dipolar interaction over the whole square lattice, and are the bulk reflection and transmission coefficients, respectively, when electromagnetic fields strike from medium r pq t pq p to q . From these, we compute the transmission | t 13 | 2 \u2261 | t 13 ( N ) | 2 for N \u2009>\u20090 and N \u2009=\u20090 corresponding to systems with and without graphene plasmonic resonators. The extinction spectra measured in the experiments is the relative difference in these transmissions 1 \u2212 | t 13 ( N ) | 2 / t 13 ( N = 0 ) | 2 . The calculations clearly determine confinement effects of electromagnetic fields due to graphene plasmons. Under infrared laser irradiation, the diamon\u2010like carbon layers and graphene\u2010disk resonators absorb electromagnetic energy and are heated up. The temperature increase in cylinderical coordinate, \u0394 T \u2009\u2261\u2009\u0394 T ( \u03C1 , z ), obeys the heat diffusion equation. Because the graphene resonator is a 2D material, the thermal conductivity is anisotropic. This diffusion equation in the layer including all stacked plasmonic disks is \u03BA 1 \u2225 1 \u03C1 d d \u03C1 ( \u03C1 d \u0394 T d \u03C1 ) + \u03BA 1 \u22A5 d 2 \u0394 T d z 2 = p 0 e \u2212 2 \u03C1 2 w 2 e \u2212 \u03BD 1 z where p 0 is the laser power per unit volume, w is the laser spot, \u03BD 1 is the absorption coefficient, \u03BA 1\u2225 and \u03BA 1\u22A5 are the effective in\u2010plane and out\u2010of\u2010plane thermal conductivity, respectively. To consider a uniform illumination condition, one simply takes w \u2009=\u2009\u221E and follows the same analysis as given in the study by Phan et al. These conductivities are strongly dependent on the fraction of graphene plasmons in the plasmonic layer, which is f p \u2009=\u2009\u03C0 D 2 /4 a 2 . By adopting Maxwell\u2013Garnett (MG) theory for an effective medium approximation, \u03BA 1\u2225 and \u03BA and 1\u22A5 are \u03BA 1 \u2225 , \u22A5 = \u03BA m ( 1 \u2212 f p ) ( \u03BA \u2225 , \u22A5 bulk + 2 \u03BA m ) + 3 f p \u03BA \u2225 , \u22A5 bulk ( 1 \u2212 f p ) ( \u03BA \u2225 , \u22A5 bulk + 2 \u03BA m ) + 3 f p \u03BA m where \u03BA \u2225 bulk \u2248 630 \u2009 W \u2009 m \u2212 1 \u2009 K \u2212 1 \u03BA \u22A5 bulk \u2248 6 \u2009 W \u2009 m \u2212 1 \u2009 K \u2212 1 are the corresponding conductivity of bulk graphene, and \u03BA m \u2009\u2248\u20090.6\u2009W\u2009m \u22121 \u2009K indicated that the vertical coupling of graphene nanodisks is relatively strong and plays an important role in the frequency range from 140 to 350\u2009cm are greater than 0.57\u2009eV (\u2248460\u2009cm \u22121 is the thermal conductivity of medium (air). Here, we ignore the effects of plasmon and phonon coupling between graphene layers. A prior work \u22121 . However, resonant frequencies in our optical spectra in Figure \u22121 ). Thus, this strong coupling between vertically stacked graphene nanodisks may not (or may) happen in this work. According to Beer\u2013Lambert's law, one can estimate \u03BD 1 \u2248 Q abs / a 2 L , in which Q abs = 4 2 \u03C0 \u03C9 I m ( \u03B1 ( \u03C9 ) ) / c \u03B5 1 + \u03B5 2 is the absorption cross section, L = N \u03B4 is the thickness of graphene nanostructures with \u03B4 = 0.335 \u2009 nm , and 1 / ( a 2 L ) is the density of graphene resonators on the surface of the dielectric film. In the diamond\u2010like layer, the diffusion equation is \u03BA 2 [ 1 \u03C1 d d \u03C1 ( \u03C1 d \u0394 T d \u03C1 ) + d 2 \u0394 T d z 2 ] = p 0 e \u2212 2 \u03C1 2 w 2 e \u2212 \u03BD 1 L \u2212 \u03BD 2 ( z \u2212 L ) where \u03BA 2 \u2009\u2248\u20090.6\u2009W\u2009K is the thermal conductivity of the diamond\u2010like layer and \u22121 \u2009m \u22121 \u03BD 2 \u2009\u2248\u20091.5\u2009\u03BCm . \u22121 is the absorption coefficient. For simplification purpose, we assume that the silicon substrate is kept at ambient temperature by contacting with a thermostat. This boundary condition was used to successfully analyze experiments in ref. To solve these differential equations, we take the Hankel transform of the aforementioned equations in \u03C1 and it gives \u2212 \u03BA 1 \u2225 u 2 \u0398 ( u , z ) + \u03BA 1 \u22A5 d 2 \u0398 ( u , z ) d z 2 = \u03BD 1 P 0 ( 1 \u2212 R ) 2 \u03C0 e \u2212 u 2 w 2 8 e \u2212 \u03BD 1 z , 0 \u2264 z \u2264 L \u03BA 2 [ \u2212 u 2 \u0398 ( u , z ) + d 2 \u0398 ( u , z ) d z 2 ] = \u03BD 2 P 0 ( 1 \u2212 R ) 2 \u03C0 e \u2212 u 2 w 2 8 e \u2212 \u03BD 1 L e \u2212 \u03BD 2 ( z \u2212 L ) , L \u2264 z \u2264 L + h where \u0394 T ( \u03C1 , z ) = \u222B 0 \u221E \u0398 ( u , z ) J 0 ( \u03C1 u ) u d u with J 0 being the Bessel function of the first kind. P The reflection is calculated by 0 is the power of the incident flux. A correction factor ( 1 \u2212 R ) implies that only the absorption and transmission component of light play a role in the heating process. The analysis is consistent with a recent work.

The numerical results indicate the plasmonic peak for a square lattice of three\u2010layer\u2010graphene disks is roughly located at 0.1\u2009eV (\u2248806\u2009cm [9] Figure \u22121 ), which quantitatively agrees with experiment in ref. . The presence of graphene plasmons reduces the transmission of electromagnetic fields through these systems. An inrease in N blue\u2010shifts the plasmonic resonance and enhances the amplitude signal in the optical spectra. More mid\u2010infrared optical energy is confined in the system as increasing the layer number of graphene plasmons. The amount of the trapped energy can be indirectly measured via temperature caused by the light\u2010to\u2010heat conversion process. Theoretical extinction spectra for systems having a graphene\u2010disk array with E F \u2009=\u20090.45\u2009eV and \u210F \u03C4 \u2212 1 = 0.03 \u2009 eV at several numbers of graphene layers. Other parameters can tuned to modify the extinction spectrum. Because \u03B1 ( \u03C9 ) \u223C D 3 , a reduction of the diameter weakens the in\u2010plane plasmonic coupling among resonators and lowers the optical peak when fixing a . Similar behaviors can be observed if the diameter remains unchanged and we increase the lattice period a . Meanwhile due to \u03C3 ( \u03C9 ) \u223C E F , the effects of graphene plasmons on the optical spectrum becomes less important while decreasing E F . to calculate the spatial distributions of steady\u2010state temperature when exposed by an infrared laser beam. This laser operates at \u22480.1\u2009eV with the incoming power for different To investigate the effects of the graphene plasmon layers on heating of graphene\u2010disk systems, we use Equation P 0 = 630 \u2009 \u03BC W and w = 2.3 \u2009 \u03BC m . Numerical results are shown in Figure N . The incident photons are highly localized at the surface and spatially decay toward the bottom of the diamond\u2010like carbon layer. The temperature increase at the hottest spot area ( z \u2009=\u20090 and \u03C1 = 0 ) in the case of N \u2009=\u200910 is 45\u2009K , whereas that of systems having N \u2009=\u20093 and N \u2009=\u20091 are approximately 33 and 34.5\u2009K, respectively. These temperature increases are much higher than \u0394 T ( \u03C1 = 0, z = 0 ) \u2248 1.67 \u2009 K for the system without graphene plasmons. This result clearly indicates that the dielectric loss is dominated by the ohmic loss (Joule heating) on graphene resonators under the mid\u2010infrared irradiation. Spatial contour plots of the steady\u2010state temperature increase in Kelvin units in graphene\u2010based systems having a) N \u2009=\u20091, b) N \u2009=\u20093, and c) N \u2009=\u200910 under illumination of a quantum cascade laser light. The temperature increase strongly depends on the incident power P 0 and the laser spot , one analytically finds that w . On the basis of Equation \u0394 T ( \u03C1 , z ) is proportional to P For Meanwhile, at fixed incoming power, an increase in 0 . This finding is consistent with many prior works. N \u2009=\u20093, our numerical results give \u0394 T ( 0 , 0 ) = 0.0521 P 0 and predicts \u0394 T ( 0,0 ) \u2248 330 \u2009 K as P 0 = 6.3 \u2009 mW , which is close to \u0394 T \u2248 365 \u2009 K . w leads to a decrease in the laser intensity ( 2 P 0 / \u03C0 w 2 ). It is well known that the absorbed optical energy of a plasmonic resonator is approximately 2 Q abs P 0 / \u03C0 w 2 . This analysis suggests that \u0394 T max \u223C 1 / w 2 and/or log 10 ( \u0394 T ( 0 , 0 ) ) is inversely linear to log 10 ( w ) . This correlation is in a good agreement with the numerical calculations. The thermal conductivity of the thin film ( \u03BA 2 ) below graphene plasmons has a significant influence on the temperature increase in graphene\u2010based systems. To zeroth\u2010order approximation, we assume a decoupling between \u03BA 2 and \u03B5 The effects of the grain boundary on the thermal conductivity is frequency independent. However, a prior work indicated that the grain boundary does not alter the dielectric and infrared response of a ceramic material at room temperature. Thus, one can modify the grain boundary scattering without changing the dielectric constant of the host material. 2 . This assumption may be reasonable because the phonon scattering, which is very important in the lattice thermal conductivity, strongly depends on the interfacial roughness. shows that the steady temperature profile of the system for different values of Figure \u03BA . The object having a larger 2 illuminated by the mid\u2010infrared laser light. We use the same laser as the calculations in Figure \u03BA 2 requires more thermal energy to be heated. Thus, the temperature increase is depressed. Spatial contour plots of the steady\u2010state temperature increase in Kelvin units in graphene\u2010based systems having N \u2009=\u20093 and a) \u03BA 2 = 0.6 \u2009 W \u2009 m \u2212 1 \u2009 K \u2212 1 , b) \u03BA 2 = 1.2 \u2009 W \u2009 m \u2212 1 \u2009 K \u2212 1 , and c) \u03BA 2 = 2.0 \u2009 W \u2009 m \u2212 1 \u2009 K \u2212 1 under illumination of a quantum cascade laser light. While illuminating the systems by the laser light, plasmonic nanodisks absorb more optical energy than the counterparts without graphene and convert to thermal dissipation. This finding indicates that the ohmic loss is much larger than the dielectric loss in the mid\u2010infrared regime. An increase in graphene plasmonic layers enhances the thermal gradients. At fixed number of graphene layers, the temperature increase is linearly proportional to the optical power and decays as the inverse square of the laser spot. Furthermore, a decrease in the heated temperature, as increasing the thermal conductivity of the thin film layer, is also calcualted and discussed. We have proposed to investigate the plasmonic heating of graphene\u2010based systems under irradiation of a mid\u2010infrared laser. The nanostructures comprise a square array of multilayer graphene nanodisks deposited on the diamond\u2010like carbon thin film, which is supported by a silicon substrate. We use the dipole model associated with the random\u2010phase approximation to calculate the polarizability of graphene on the substance and its absorption cross section. From these, the reflection and transmission coefficients are theoretically computed to estimate the confined power of the incident light. Our numerical results are in accordance with experiments.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.01\u20102018.337.

It is, therefore, crucial to gain insights into the outbreak mechanism of HCBs and understand the spatiotemporal variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in this highly turbid and productive water. This study aims to evaluate the predictable performance of both approaches using satellite band ratio and machine learning for Chl-a concentration retrieval—a proxy of HCBs. The monthly water quality samples collected from 2016 to 2018 and 23 cloud free Sentinel-2A/B scenes were used to develop Chl-a retrieval models. For the band ratio approach, a strong linear relationship with in situ Chl-a was found for two-band algorithm of Green-NIR. The band ratio-based model accounts for 72% of variation in Chl-a concentration from 2016 to 2018 datasets with an RMSE of 5.95 μg/L. For the machine learning approach, Gaussian process regression (GPR) yielded superior results for Chl-a prediction from water quality parameters with the values of 0.79 (R2) and 3.06 μg/L (RMSE). Among various climatic parameters, a high correlation (R2 = 0.54) between the monthly total precipitation and Chl-a concentration was found. Our analysis also found nitrogen-rich water and TSS in the rainy season as the driving factors of observed HCBs in the eutrophic Tri An Reservoir (TAR), which offer important solutions to the management of HCBs in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Band ratio regression; Chlorophyll-a; Gaussian process regression; Harmful cyanobacterial blooms; Machine learning; Sentinel-2A/B; Tri An Reservoir","algal bloom; chlorophyll a; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; drinking water; eutrophic environment; machine learning; satellite data; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; water quality; Tri An Reservoir; Viet Nam; Cyanobacteria; chlorophyll; chemistry; eutrophication; lake; Chlorophyll; Eutrophication; Lakes; Machine Learning; Vietnam","","chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; Chlorophyll","This study was funded by Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) under grant number “KHCBSS.02/19-21”.","Sentinel Data Access 2017 Annual Report, (2017); Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, (2025); Beaver, John R., Environmental factors influencing the quantitative distribution of microcystin and common potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria in U.S. lakes and reservoirs, Harmful Algae, 78, pp. 118-128, (2018); Blix, Katalin, Gaussian Process Sensitivity Analysis for Oceanic Chlorophyll Estimation, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 10, 4, pp. 1265-1277, (2017); Blix, Katalin, Evaluation of Feature Ranking and Regression Methods for Oceanic Chlorophyll-a Estimation, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 11, 5, pp. 1403-1418, (2018); Blix, Katalin, Machine learning automatic model selection algorithm for oceanic chlorophyll-a content retrieval, Remote Sensing, 10, 5, (2018); Bresciani, Mariano, Mapping phytoplankton blooms in deep subalpine lakes from Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8, Hydrobiologia, 824, 1, pp. 197-214, (2018); Bui, Ha Manh, Prediction of cyanobacterial blooms in the Dau Tieng Reservoir using an artificial neural network, Marine and Freshwater Research, 68, 11, pp. 2070-2080, (2017); Chen, Jiang, Remote estimation of colored dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll-a in Lake Huron using Sentinel-2 measurements, Journal of Applied Remote Sensing, 11, 3, (2017); Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water A Guide to their Public Health Consequences Monitoring and Management, (1999)","","Springer","","","","","","09441344; 16147499","","ESPLE","31916153","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077529085"

We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze relevant studies with findings of an association between autism spectrum disorder and breastfeeding patterns, and undertook an extensive dose-response analysis to interpret the results more accurately. Ten electronic databases and manual search of reference lists were used to identify relevant studies in September 2018. Dose-response and conventional meta-analysis were conducted by the random-effects model. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO with CRD42016043128. Seven case-control studies were found in which the association between ever breastfeeding and risk of autism spectrum disorder was investigated. We found a 58 % decrease in the risk of autism spectrum disorder with ever breastfeeding and a 76 % decrease in the risk with exclusive breastfeeding. According to our dose-response meta-analysis, breastfeeding for 6 months was associated with a 54 % reduction in the risk. In the conventional meta-analysis, breastfeeding for 12–24 months was associated with the most significant reduction in the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Our results highlight the importance of breastfeeding to decrease the risk of autism spectrum disorder. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Association; Autism spectrum disorder; Breastfeeding; Risk","Article; autism; breast feeding; disease association; DSM-III; DSM-IV; DSM-IV-TR; evidence based practice; family income; genetic susceptibility; groups by age; human; ICD-10; ICD-9; immunization; maternal age; nutritional status; parenting education; pathogenesis; priority journal; risk factor; risk reduction; self report; sex ratio; systematic review; meta analysis; protection; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Breast Feeding; Humans; Protective Factors","","","We would like to thank Nguyen Dang Kien, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Thai Binh University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Thai Binh, Vietnam, Dang Thi Bich Hop, School of Medicine, Viet Nam National University of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Sara Morsy, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt and Ibrahim Ahmed Mohammed Elsherbini, Alexandria Medical School, Alexandria, Egypt for their contribution to the study.","Al-Farsi, Yahya Mohammed, Effect of suboptimal breast-feeding on occurrence of autism: A case-control study, Nutrition, 28, 7-8, pp. e27-e32, (2012); Aap News J, (2012); Anderson, James W., Breast-feeding and cognitive development: A meta-analysis, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 70, 4, pp. 525-535, (1999); Andersson, Yvonne, Formula feeding skews immune cell composition toward adaptive immunity compared to breastfeeding, Journal of Immunology, 183, 7, pp. 4322-4328, (2009); Le Couteur, Ann Simone, Autism as a strongly genetic disorder evidence from a british twin Study, Psychological Medicine, 25, 1, pp. 63-77, (1995); J Gizi Klin Indones, (2012); Belfort, Mandy Brown, Infant feeding and childhood cognition at ages 3 and 7 years: Effects of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, JAMA Pediatrics, 167, 9, pp. 836-844, (2013); Boucher, Olivier, Association between breastfeeding duration and cognitive development, autistic traits and ADHD symptoms: A multicenter study in Spain, Pediatric Research, 81, 3, pp. 434-442, (2017); Brion, Marie Jo A., What are the causal effects of breastfeeding on IQ, obesity and blood pressure?

The distributary channels of the Mekong Delta represent a typical example of a complex sedimentary environment characterized by strong fluvial and tidal interactions, and seasonal variability in hydro-sedimentary dynamic processes, particularly the migration of a salt wedge front linked to seasonal fluctuations in freshwater discharge. For this study, we analyzed grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and organic elemental geochemistry of channel-bed surficial sediments collected in 2015 from all distributary channels during the dry season and from the Mekong–Co Chien River during the flood season. This paper reports spatial and seasonal differences in the characteristics of channel-bed surficial sediments, which are closely linked to sediment sources and depositional processes during the dry and flood seasons. Distributary channels are characterized by coarse-grained sediments in the upper reaches and fine-grained sediments in the lower reaches, in both dry and flood seasons, reflecting the difference between the upstream fluvial-dominated environment and the downstream tide-dominated environment. Flood season samples from the Co Chien River show higher magnetic mineral contents and a terrestrial source of organic carbon compared with dry season samples, indicating sourcing from the drainage basin and trapping of suspended materials in the distributary channel due to the barrier effect of the saltwater wedge at the river mouth. Compared with the flood season, during the dry season the mud content was lower in the downstream reach close to the river mouth and higher in the upstream reach of the Co Chien River, and the content of magnetic minerals was lower in both reaches, indicating dissolution of magnetic minerals during early diagenesis. Furthermore, the lower C/N ratios (<10) and slightly enriched δ13C values of the dry season samples from the Co Chien River imply an additional contribution of organic carbon from a marine source. These various features imply a landward import of mud into the Co Chien River induced by stronger salinity intrusion during the dry season. Along the downstream tract of the Bassac River, two mud-dominated reaches were identified during the dry season. The magnetic mineral contents, C/N ratios and δ13C values indicate that the mud-dominated reach near the Bassac River mouth is also supplied from resuspended sediments by estuarine circulation and tidal pumping, whereas the mud in the reach that is transitional from fluvial to tide dominance has a riverine supply. The results suggest that the Mekong distributary channels are important sinks for suspended sediments during both the flood and dry seasons, controlled by a sediment trapping mechanism provided by either estuarine processes or the morphological configuration of the channels, both of which are controlled by fluvial–tidal dynamics. These depositional processes may be compensating for the incision of channels induced by sand mining in recent decades. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fluvial–marine transition zone; River-mouth sediment dynamics; Salinity intrusion; Sediment source; Sediment trapping","Catchments; Cobalt; Deposition; Drought; Floods; Geochemistry; Grain size and shape; Magnetic susceptibility; Magnetism; Minerals; Organic carbon; Sedimentology; Stratigraphy; Surficial sediments; Suspended sediments; Salinity intrusion; Sediment dynamic; Sediment sources; Sediment trapping; Transition zones; Rivers; freshwater environment; grain size; hydrogeochemistry; magnetic susceptibility; seasonal variation; sediment trap; spatiotemporal analysis; transition zone; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: This research was conducted as a part of a joint research program between Shimane University and HCMC Institute of Resources Geography, VAST .

The system is developed on the basis of material and energy exchange potentials between the wastewater and exhaust gas flows, and the use of available firewood ash as material for absorption. Two operation modes were presented aiming at a complete treatment of wastewater and exhaust gases as required by the Vietnamese national standards, and the recovery of valuable components in the system (N, P) for obtaining value-added products (such as fertilizer, irrigation water, etc.). In addition, the maximization of potentials on existing natural conditions at the local family, the avoidance of chemicals used in the system etc. have also helped to lower the investment and operation costs of the treatment facilities. The application of this system also contributes to the “greening” of the rice production chain in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam and is an example for a local closed cycle economy. Several public activities have also been conducted at the demonstration site (at the local family) with the purpose of maintaining and multiplying the system's effectiveness among the local public community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cleaner production; Closed cycle economy; Integrated ecosystem; Livestock; Pollution prevention; Rice-paper production chain","Economics; Exhaust gases; Investments; Irrigation; Papermaking; River pollution; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Water craft; Cleaner production; Closed cycle; Livestock; Paper production; Pollution prevention; Pollution control; Animals; Pollution Control; Production; Rivers; Systems; Vietnam; Water Pollution","","","Funding text 1: Authors sincerely thank the Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City for the financial support of this research (grant number B2018-24-01), and the AseaUninet for collaboration with IPPE, TU Graz, Austria, to implement this study.; Funding text 2: Authors sincerely thank the Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City for the financial support of this research (grant number B2018-24-01 ), and the AseaUninet for collaboration with IPPE, TU Graz, Austria, to implement this study.","Bell, Lindsay W., Evolution in crop-livestock integration systems that improve farm productivity and environmental performance in Australia, European Journal of Agronomy, 57, pp. 10-20, (2014); Bonmatí Blasi, August, Air stripping of ammonia from pig slurry: Characterisation and feasibility as a pre- or post-treatment to mesophilic anaerobic digestion, Waste Management, 23, 3, pp. 261-272, (2003); Boydak, Özlem, Thermodynamic investigation of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) energy recovery system and recent studies, Thermal Science, 2018, pp. 2679-2690, (2018); Engle, Carole Ruth, Optimal Product Mix for Integrated Livestock‐Fish Culture Systems on Limited Resource Farms, Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 18, 3, pp. 137-147, (1987); Fernandez-Delgado Juarez, Marina, Co-composting of biowaste and wood ash, influence on a microbially driven-process, Waste Management, 46, pp. 155-164, (2015); Fontenot, Quenton C., Effects of temperature, salinity, and carbon: nitrogen ratio on sequencing batch reactor treating shrimp aquaculture wastewater, Bioresource Technology, 98, 9, pp. 1700-1703, (2007); Guo, Jianhua, Short- and long-term effects of temperature on partial nitrification in a sequencing batch reactor treating domestic wastewater, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 179, 1-3, pp. 471-479, (2010); undefined, (2018); Hai, Lethanh, An integrated eco-model of agriculture and small-scale industry in craft villages toward cleaner production and sustainable development in rural areas – A case study from Mekong delta of Viet Nam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 137, pp. 274-282, (2016); Harrison, Roland, A review of the effect of N fertilizer type on gaseous emissions, Advances in Agronomy, 73, pp. 65-108, (2001)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074685736"

Adhesion strength of as-coated HAp and OCP layers was evaluated by a pull-off test, and that of HAp layers after immersing in a medium for 14 days was also evaluated. The as-coated pH 7.5-HAp layer showed higher adhesion strength of 6.7 MPa than 3.8 MPa of the as-coated pH 8.6-HAp layer, which was attributed to the former denser structure than the latter. The adhesion strength of the as-coated pH 5.5- and pH 6.2-OCP (+monetite) layers was both 4.2 MPa that was governed by the thick and fragile property of the layers. After immersing in a medium, the adhesion strength of pH 7.5- and pH 8.6-specimens decreased to 4.9 and 3.1 MPa, respectively.

However, in temporal prediction the quantization error contributes its value as noise in the total residual information. Therefore, the residual signal of the inter-picture prediction is greater than the expected one and always differs zero value even input video contains only homogeneous frames. In this paper, we reveal negative effects of quantization errors in inter prediction and propose a video encoding scheme which is able to avoid side effects of quantization errors in the stationary parts. We propose to implement a motion detection algorithm as the first stage of video encoding to separate the video into two parts: motion and static. The motion information allows us to force residual data of non-changed part to zero and keep the residual signal of motion regularly. Beside, we design block-based filters which improve motion results and filter those results fit into block encode size well. Fixed residual data of static information permits us to pre-calculate its quantized coefficient and create a bypass encoding path for it. Experimental results with the JPEG compression (MJPEG-DPCM) showed that the proposed method produces lower bitrate than the conventional MJPEG-DPCM at the same quantization parameter and a lower computational complexity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","MJPEG; motion detection; video coding; Video compression","Encoding (symbols); Forecasting; Image coding; Motion analysis; Signal encoding; Video signal processing; Amount of information; Bit rates; Images compression; Inter-frame; MJPEG; Motion detection; Quantization errors; Residual datum; Residual signals; Video encodings; Image compression","","","This work has been supported by Vietnam National University, Hanoi(VNU) under the project number QG.18.38.

However, the coconut jelly production has resulted in significant environmental impacts, particularly to the aquatic environment due to its heavily polluted wastewater e.g. very high values of COD (up to 120,000 mg/1), of total nitrogen (up to 1,740 mg/1), and of total phosphorus (up to 64 mg/1). The available wastewater treatment technology for such type of wastewater is likely to be not economically efficient due to the small-scale production at craft villages in the developing countries. This study developed and demonstrated an integrated eco-model for small (family) scale production of raw coconut jelly in craft villages which applied Cleaner Production sollutions for pollution prevention on the basis of available conditions at the local family. The system demonstration showed a win-win solution for family with major benefits by reduction of 90% of pollutants (i.e 27 kg COD, 21.4 kg BOD5, approx. 7 kg N, 113 g P and 28 kg SO<inf>4</inf>2- for one production batch), as well as the other benefit by major reduction of 90 % of investment and operating costs of the wastewater treatment plant. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial cellulose; Cleaner production; Ecosystem; Integrated pollution reduction; Nata de coco","","","","This research was funded by the Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under the grant number KHCN-TNB/14-19/C25.

In this work, the subchronic effects of the cyanobacterial crude extracts (CCEs) from microcystin-producing and microcystin-free cyanobacteria with different microcystin concentrations (1, 10, and 50 µgL−1)on Daphnia magna were investigated. The life-history trait responses of D. magna to CCEs were determined based on survival, reproduction, and somatic growth. In addition, the physiological response, represented by the feeding rate of D. magna on green algae (Scenedesmus sp.), after exposure to both types of crude extracts was estimated. Our results showed that both microcystin-containing (MCCE) and microcystin-free (NCCE) crude extracts insignificantly reduced survival but strongly enhanced reproduction and somatic growth of organisms. However, degradation of eggs and neonates of the gravid females exposed to CCEs was observed. In addition, the feeding rate of D. magna exposed to MCCE increased significantly, whereas no change in the feeding rate was observed for NCCE-exposed D. magna.

The radius of influence of TCs on local rainfall was limited to 500 km from TC centers. The average annual number of TCs affecting Vietnam has decreased slightly in the last two decades compared to previous decades. The ratio of TC-induced rainfall to total rainfall attained the highest value of 37.3% in the central region, in July. The temporal distribution of TC-induced rainfall coincided with the frequency of TCs, with an active period from June to November. During 1979-2019, the non-TC rainfall was the main contributor to the change in total rainfall, especially in relation to the decline in the north and the increase in the coastal South Central region. The rainfall trend during the entire period was principally explained by the interdecadal shift in the late 1990s. Rainfall intensity and the number of heavy rainfall days were intensified for total rainfall and non-TC rainfall, indicating that TCs contributed minimally to the changes of extreme rainfall events during 1979-2019. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","for their helpful comments.

In vitro embryo production from in vitro matured (IVM) oocytes is an important tool for the utilization of cryopreserved porcine sperm. The aim of this study was to compare two media for the IVM of Ban pig oocytes. Immature oocytes were subjected to IVM either in a non-defined (TCM-199 + pig follicular fluid) or in a defined base medium (POM + epidermal growth factor). At the end of IVM, the oocytes were in vitro fertilized (IVF) with frozen Ban sperm. Ten hours after IVF, the oocytes were either subjected to orcein staining to check fertilization and maturation status or cultured in vitro for 7 days. There was no difference between the two IVM media in terms of percentages of oocyte maturation and blastocyst production. However, the percentage of male pronuclear formation after IVF and the total cell numbers in blastocysts were higher with the defined system. Zygotes obtained by the two IVM systems survived vitrification at similar rates. In conclusion, the two IVM systems were both effective for the production of Ban pig embryos; however, better embryo quality was achieved with the defined one. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ban pig oocytes; embryos; maturation; medium","animal; blastocyst; cryopreservation; female; in vitro fertilization; in vitro oocyte maturation; male; mammalian embryo; oocyte; pig; procedures; spermatozoon; veterinary medicine; Viet Nam; vitrification; zygote; Animals; Blastocyst; Cryopreservation; Embryo, Mammalian; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques; Male; Oocytes; Spermatozoa; Swine; Vietnam; Vitrification; Zygote","","","This work was supported by JST/JICA SATREPS with counterpart funding from Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) for Institute of Biotechnology (IBT).","Abeydeera, Lalantha R., Presence of β-mercaptoethanol can increased the glutathione content of pig oocytes matured in vitro and the rate of blastocyst development after in vitro fertilization, Theriogenology, 50, 5, pp. 747-756, (1998); Abeydeera, Lalantha R., Development and viability of pig oocytes matured in a protein-free medium containing epidermal growth factor, Theriogenology, 54, 5, pp. 787-797, (2000); Chia, Choy May, EGF, TGF-α and EGFR expression in human preimplantation embryos, Development (Cambridge), 121, 2, pp. 299-307, (1995); Choi, Moon-hwan, Retrieval of porcine ovarian follicles by different methods, Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences, 21, 3, pp. 353-357, (2008); Dang-Nguyen, Thanh Quang, Introduction of various Vietnamese indigenous pig breeds and their conservation by using assisted reproductive techniques, Journal of Reproduction and Development, 56, 1, pp. 31-35, (2010); Ding, Jianchi, Epidermal growth factor enhances oocyte maturation in pigs, Molecular Reproduction and Development, 39, 1, pp. 30-40, (1994); Vivo Conservation of Animal Genetic Resources, (2013); Funahashi, Hiroaki, Different hormonal requirements of pig oocyte-cumulus complexes during maturation in vitro, Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, 101, 1, pp. 159-165, (1994); Grupen, Christopher Gerald, The evolution of porcine embryo invitro production, Theriogenology, 81, 1, pp. 24-37, (2014); Hong, Jiyoung, Effects of amino acids on maturation, fertilization and embryo development of pig follicular oocytes in two IVM media, Theriogenology, 62, 8, pp. 1473-1482, (2004)","","Blackwell Publishing","","","","","","13443941; 17400929","","","32618066","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087472078"

Results showed that reaction temperature plays a significant role in the rate of char oxidation. In the case of higher temperature, the rate of char oxidation is significantly shorter than that of lower temperature. The effect of particle sizes on oxidation is not as large as that of temperatures. In general, the rate of oxidation and the complete time of that decrease with increase in particle size. The characteristics of biomass strongly effect on the rate of char oxidation. In all experiments, the conversion rate of char oxidation of the inside part of the beefwood is higher than that of beefwood bark. Char oxidation rate of beech bark is higher than or nearly equal to that of the inside part of the beech. There is no significant difference in the rate of char oxidation between the inside part of the beefwood and beech wood bark. However, all kinds of biomass in this study have a faster rate of oxidation than that of coal. Therefore, these works can support the design of combustion reactors in a commercial plant. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors acknowledge the financial and other supports provided by IHI Corporation, Japan and Hanoi University of Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam.","Energy Procedia, (2012); Matrix Science Mathematic, (2019); Cao, Wenhan, Study on the ignition behavior and kinetics of combustion of biomass, Energy Procedia, 142, pp. 136-141, (2017); Acta Mechanica Malaysia, (2019); Li, Jun, Studies of Ignition Behavior of Biomass Particles in a Down-Fire Reactor for Improving Co-firing Performance, Energy and Fuels, 30, 7, pp. 5870-5877, (2016); Advances in Industrial Engineering and Management, (2019); Liu, Yinhe, Ignition and kinetics analysis of coal combustion in low oxygen concentration, Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, 34, 9, pp. 810-819, (2012); Engineering Heritage Journal, (2019); Nguyen, Hong Nam, Kinetics of rice husk char gasification in an H2O or a CO2 atmosphere, Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, 40, 14, pp. 1701-1713, (2018)","","Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology","","","","","","10241752","","JERDF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083902311"

However, the reliability issues due to the low yield rates and the sensitivity to thermal hotspots and stress issues are preventing TSV-based 3D-ICs from being widely and efficiently used. To ensure the correctness of TSV connections at run-time, detecting multiple (clustering) defects is an important feature. While Error Correction Codes are limited by a certain number of detectable faults, using Built-In-Self-Test (BIST) prevents the system from operating normally during the test time. This paper first presents a Parity Product Code (PPC) with the ability to correct one fault and detect, at least, two faults. Second, we present extended PPC (EPPC) to detect multiple defects within the links of Networks-on-Chip by using two or more additional matrices. Furthermore, we present the distance-aware version of EPPC to detect multiple defects by using only one extra matrix. The results show that the distance-aware EPPC can detect 100% of clustering defects and multiple random defects within two and three cycles, respectively. The performance evaluation for Network-on-Chip testing also shows no degradation while providing an extremely short response time (2-3 cycles). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D-ICs; error correction code; fault-detection; fault-tolerance; networks-on-chip; parity check; product code; through-silicon-via","Built-in self test; Defects; Electronics packaging; Error correction; Network-on-chip; Error correction codes; Important features; Multiple defects; Networks on chips; Random defects; Short response time; Thermal Hotspots; Through-Silicon-Via (TSV); Three dimensional integrated circuits","","","This research is partly funded by Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under grant number QG.18.38.","Ben Ahmed, Akram, Architecture and design of high-throughput, low-latency, and fault-tolerant routing algorithm for 3D-network-on-chip (3D-NoC), Journal of Supercomputing, 66, 3, pp. 1507-1532, (2013); Cho, Jounghyun, Modeling and analysis of through-silicon via (TSV) noise coupling and suppression using a guard ring, IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology, 1, 2, pp. 220-233, (2011); Kim, Joohee, High-frequency scalable electrical model and analysis of a through silicon via (TSV), IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology, 1, 2, pp. 181-195, (2011); Dong, Xiangyu, System-level cost analysis and design exploration for three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs), Proceedings of the Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, ASP-DAC, pp. 234-241, (2009); Davis, William Rhett, Demystifying 3D ICs: The pros and cons of going vertical, IEEE Design and Test of Computers, 22, 6, pp. 498-510, (2005); Knickerbocker, John U., Three-dimensional silicon integration, IBM Journal of Research and Development, 52, 6, pp. 553-569, (2008); Kang, Uksong, 8 Gb 3-D DDR3 DRAM using through-silicon-via technology, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 45, 1, pp. 111-119, (2010); van der Plas, Geert A.M., Design issues and considerations for low-cost 3-D TSV IC technology, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 46, 1, pp. 293-307, (2011); Ye, Fangming, TSV open defects in 3D integrated circuits: Characterization, test, and optimal spare allocation, pp. 1024-1030, (2012); Kumar, Rajeev, Crosstalk avoidance codes for 3D VLSI, Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE, pp. 1673-1678, (2013)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083031307"

The response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite face-centered (CCF) design was empirically used to model the interactive effect of the independent variables, namely leaching temperatures of 250–450 °C, acid/concentrate (acid/conc.) mass ratios of 0.8–1.8, and leaching times of 2–6 h, on the dependent response, namely the leaching yield. And a CCF model for the leaching of the concentrate was proposed that exhibited good consistency with the experimental data. The shrinking core models for spherical particles of constant size based on the Arrhenius equation were empirically used to study the kinetics of the leaching. The activation energies calculated from the kinetic models for the chemical reaction and diffusion rate stages have the same value of 17.3 kJ·mol−1, which fitted well to a mixed control model of the chemical reaction followed by a diffusion stage at leaching temperatures in the range of 473–593 K. The kinetic studies of the leaching indicated that the leaching percent rate (or leaching yield) is controlled by the leaching temperature. The optimization of the leaching process was estimated by analyzing the contributions of the coefficients of the CCF model to the leaching yield. The results indicated that the effect of leaching temperature on leaching yield is the strongest; it is five times higher than that of the acid/conc. Mass ratio and four times higher than that of the leaching time. The effects of acid/concentration mass ratio and leaching time on leaching yield are insignificant. In addition, the optimum data for leaching are as follows: the leaching temperature, acid/conc. Mass ratio, and leaching time are 320 °C, 1.3, and 4 h, respectively. The proposed CCF model and kinetic study suggested that the optimization of the Yen Phu xenotime concentrate leaching is controlled by the leaching temperature; and the CCF model can potentially be applied in the commercial operation of Yen Phu xenotime concentrate leaching after pilot tests on 50 kg dry concentrate per batch. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Leaching; Modeling; Optimizing; Rare earths; Yen Phu xenotime","Activation energy; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Models; Rare earths; Sulfuric acid; Commercial operation; Independent variables; Optimizing; Rare earth concentrate; Response surface methodology; Shrinking core model; Sulfuric acid leaching; Xenotime; Leaching","","","Funding text 1: Authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from Ministry project (2019-2020): “Study on technology for preparation of Dysprosium metal from the oxide by metallothermic reduction method” (code: DTCB.11/19/VCNXH), VINATOM.

In recent years, the fast development electronic medical records (EMRs) has provided valuable resources for solving healthcare issues, especially learning and recommending treatments. However, most of the related studies are limited in exploiting various patient information, handling varying-length treatment records, capturing different kinds of treatment patterns and interpreting the recommendation mechanism. This research proposes three methods, one for learning and two for recommending treatments, to overcome the above drawbacks. All methods adopt a mixed-variate restrict Boltzmann machine to represent different kinds of patient records. The treatment learning method captures significant changes in prescription indication to split varying-length records flexibly and organizes sequences of prescription drugs into regimen trees to reveal many more different kinds of treatment patterns. The two treatment recommendation methods illustrate different ideas that can improve the treatment recommendation mechanism by combining the treatments derived from patient groups and neighbor patients. Our experimental evaluation was conducted on three acute disease cohorts extracted from the MIMIC III database. The obtained results show that the proposed methods are able to provide different kinds of treatment patterns and yield competitive efficacy with better interpretability as compared to relevant studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic medical records; Healthcare mining; Treatment patterns; Treatment recommendation; Treatment regimen","E-learning; Medical computing; Electronic medical record; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Experimental evaluation; Recommendation mechanism; Recommendation methods; Treatment patterns; Treatment recommendation; Treatment regimen; Patient treatment","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by Vietnam National University at Ho Chi Minh City in the project “Development of core technology for exploiting electronic medical records” under the grant B2019-42-01 and by Asian Office of Aerospace R&D (Japan) under agreement number FA2386-18-1-4029 .

With this system, students would achieve better performance, find it easy to select courses without wondering which will give them high score or which are better for their future job or career path. The core functionalities of the system are partly based on recommendation methods. The first task is the prediction of student performance to help them estimate their performances on selected courses. These predicted results help students choose courses that are appropriate for them to get higher scores. Second, the system will automatically build a study strategy for next two years or even entirely four academic years based on their ability and related information. Our system also provides students a general view of their learning status: profile, grades, taken courses, credits, important school news, time table, etc. By using these functionalities, students will have a guidance and an up-to-date studying path to follow, as well as efficiently complete their school work. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","recommender system; student performance prediction; study strategy","","","","This work was fully supported by the Project QG.15.29 and Project QG.16.34 from Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU).

The volcanoes are aligned along a sub-meridian oriented extensional fault, from Phu Son in the south via Chư B'luk, Ea T'ling in the middle to Nam Dong in the north. The basalts are divided into geochemically alkaline and tholeiitic groups. Ne-normative alkaline basalts include samples from the upper layer of Phu Son volcano, those in the Trinh Nu waterfall area (Ea T'ling volcano) and cored samples conducted near the Dray Sap waterfall. Q-normative tholeiitic basalts include all the samples from Chư B'luk and Nam Dong volcanoes, and massive basalts in the lower layer of Phu Son volcano. Geochemically the tholeiitic basalts are vastly different from the alkaline basalts in that they have higher SiO<inf>2</inf> (50–55 wt% compared to <47 wt% in alkaline basalt), Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (>14–16 wt% compared to <14 wt%), lower K<inf>2</inf>O (<1.5 wt% compared to >1.5–2.5 wt%) and lower TiO<inf>2</inf> (<1.8 wt% as compared to >2 wt% in alkaline basalt). Melting temperature and pressure calculations based on computing primitive melt compositions showed that the tholeiitic basalts may be produced in a narrow temperature range of 1365–1385 °C, corresponding to pressure of 1.2–1.6 GPa. The alkaline basalts may be produced in a temperature range between 1400 and 1440 °C and pressure varying from 3.1 to 3.35 GPa. Both the tholeiitic and alkaline basalts are free of crustal contamination. They show geochemically similar characteristics to those of continental intraplate basalts although the alkaline basalt show much more enrichment in incompatible elements. The 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd ratios of the two basaltic groups are quite similar, varying within narrow ranges of, respectively, 0.7038–0.7041, 0.5129–0.51286 but their 206Pb/204Pb isotopic ratios vary widely relative to 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb suggesting their interaction with different isotopic components and/or isotopic evolution history. Isotopic modeling relative to major mantle isotopic components suggests that the alkaline basalts may be generated by interaction between an N-MORB-like and an enriched mantle type 1 (EM1) at deep levels. The isotopic component is usually known as DUPAL-like regional mantle isotopic anomaly believed to be widespread in SE Asian mantle. The isotopic compositions of tholeiitic basalt may be generated by mixing between the DUPAL-like component with an enriched mantle type 2 (EM2)-like at higher levels in the lithospheric mantle. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dac Nong; Isotopic anomaly; Krông Nô; Pleistocene volcanism; Primary melt","basalt; isotopic composition; mantle source; partial melting; Pleistocene; pyroclastic deposit; volcanic eruption; volcanism; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam ( KC09.31/16-20 ), and partially by People’s Committee of Dak Nong province to project ‘Study of geological heritages aiming to develop a geopark in the Krông Nô area’, and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology ( VAST06.04/17-18 ).

The inherent weaknesses of this standard model such as quantization error, unstructured representation, burstiness phenomenon are to some extent solved. However, it has a serious problem of searching small objects on a database with cluttered background. In many situations, even the irrelevant objects which share the same texture or shape with a query object get higher score than relevant ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel fusion method to significantly boost the accuracy of instance search systems. Firstly, we use the state-of-the-art object detector with denser feature for finding object bounding box and similarity score. Secondly, to exploit the spatial relationship of each visual word with an object proposal, a detected area that might contain a query object, we define three categories of visual word pairs, i.e., discriminative, weak relevant, and context inferred ones. Finally, we propose a new re-ranking scheme with three weighting functions corresponding to the three categories of visual word pairs to compute the final similarity score between a query topic and a video shot. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on datasets which have a wide variety of types of query objects. Experimental results on TRECVID Instance Search datasets (INS2013 and INS2014) show the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bag-of-visual-word model; Object proposal; Spatial fusion; Video instance search","","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2017-26-01 and University of Dayton under STEM Catalyst Grant.","Arandjelović, Relja, Three things everyone should know to improve object retrieval, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2911-2918, (2012); IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, (2017); Awad, George, Instance search retrospective with focus on TRECVID, International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 6, 1, (2017); Cao, Yang, Spatial-bag-of-features, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3352-3359, (2010); Chum, Ondřej, Total recall II: Query expansion revisited, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 889-896, (2011); Chum, Ondřej, Total recall: Automatic query expansion with a generative feature model for object retrieval, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, (2007); Crowley, Elliot J., The state of the art: Object retrieval in paintings using discriminative regions, (2014); Felzenszwalb, Pedro F., Object detection with discriminatively trained part-based models, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 32, 9, pp. 1627-1645, (2010); Jégou, Hervé, Hamming embedding and weak geometric consistency for large scale image search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5302 LNCS, PART 1, pp. 304-317, (2008); Trecvid, (2013)","","Springer London","","","","","","2192662X; 21926611","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065184857"

It is endemic to southern China, central Vietnam, and eastern Laos, and today it is nearly extinct in the wild. Forest community characteristics and population structure of G. pensilis in China have remained unknown up to now. We investigated six swamp forest stands and analyzed their forest community characteristics (i.e. vertical stratification, species composition, and diversity) and population structure, including the frequency distribution of DBH (diameter at breast height) and age-classes as found in Fujian Province, southeastern China. The vertical stratifications of all the forest stands were rather simple. The remaining wild specimens ranged from roughly 15 to some 357 years for an average of ca. 85 years, with only a few individuals less than 20 years old. Compared with the stands and populations of G. pensilis in Vietnam, the taxonomic compositions of the stands in the two regions were different, except for the dominant species-G. pensilis. The Shannon–Wiener index showed the overstory of each stand had much lower diversity (0.26 on average) in Fujian Province than that (1.97 on average) in Vietnam, whereas the diversity indices were about the same (around 2.41) for the understories in the two regions. Furthermore, we discovered 18 G. pensilis seedlings at the study sites in Fujian Province. This discovery demonstrates that G. pensilis regeneration is extremely poor and its populations are declining, although these populations are relatively healthier than those in Vietnam. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age-class; Fujian Province; Glyptostrobus; Regeneration; Relict plant; Vietnam","","","","We acknowledge funding by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31760152 and 31500355 ), the Key National Research and Development Plan Program of China ( 2016YFC050310203 ), the Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC, China ( cstc2016jcyjA0379 ) and the National Program on Space Science and Technology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam ( project VT-UD.09/18-20 ).","Averyanov, Leonid V., Gymnosperms of Laos, Nordic Journal of Botany, 32, 6, pp. 765-805, (2014); Averyanov, Leonid V., Preliminary observation of native glyptostrobus pensilis (taxodiaceae) stands in vietnam, Taiwania, 54, 3, pp. 191-212, (2009); Phytologia Balcanica, (2012); Chen Ming-Hong, On the discovery of palaeogene flora from the western Sichuan Plateau and its significance in phytogeography., Acta Botanica Sinica, 25, 5, pp. 482-491, (1983); Forestry Sci Fujian, (1977); Chinese State Report on Biodiversity, (1998); undefined, (2018); A Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys, (2005); Geology of the Kobe District, (1983); Geng, Baoyin, The first discovery of Eucommia fruit fossil in China, Chinese Science Bulletin, 44, 16, pp. 1506-1508, (1999)","","KeAi Publishing Communications Ltd. office@keaipublishing.com","","","","","","24682659; 20962703","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069878393"

The nuclei of interest were produced by in-flight fission of a U238 beam at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory at RIKEN. The isomer depopulates through a γ ray of energy 56.7(1) keV and with a half-life of T1/2=3.5(4)μs. Based on the comparison with shell-model calculations, we interpret the isomer as the Iπ=5- member of the π0g9/2-1 - ν1f7/23 multiplet, decaying to the Iπ=7- ground state with a reduced-transition probability of B(E2;5-→7-)=0.53(6)W.u. Observation of this isomer, and lack of evidence in the current work for a Iπ=5- isomer decay in In132, provides a benchmark of the proton-neutron interaction in the region of the nuclear chart ""southeast"" of Sn132, where experimental information on excited states is sparse. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This experiment was performed at RI Beam Factory operated by RIKEN Nishina Center and CNS, University of Tokyo.

The free-standing Al exhibited a strong electric field enhancement as high as 58 when excited at the 532 nm. We also further bowtie antennas exhibited a strong electric field enhancement as high as 58 when excited at the 532 investigated optical properties of the fabricated free-standing Al bowtie antennas by introducing a nm. We also further investigated optical properties of the fabricated free-standing Al bowtie plasmonic dark-field scattering mapping, which revealed the resonance of each individual antenna in antennas by introducing a plasmonic dark-field scattering mapping, which revealed the resonance the range between 500 nm–675 nm. Despite of having a natural oxide Al2O3 layer, and the absence of of each individual antenna in the range between 500 nm–675 nm. Despite of having a natural oxide the chemical SERS effect, the correlated SERS mapping of Nile-blue molecules on Al bowties excited Al2O3 layer, and the absence of the chemical SERS effect, the correlated SERS mapping of Nile-blue by a 532-nm laser clearly showed that the SERS signals were observed only at the bowtie antenna molecules on Al bowties excited by a 532-nm laser clearly showed that the SERS signals were position. This evidences that the free-standing Al bowties exhibited a high SERS performance owing observed only at the bowtie antenna position. This evidences that the free-standing Al bowties to the strongly confined electromagnetic field at the nanogaps between each triangle-pair of the bowtie exhibited a high SERS performance owing to the strongly confined electromagnetic field at the antennas.

There is now growing public concern regarding increasing air pollution, especially in big cities; however, little information is available on air quality, particularly regarding semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) adsorbed on atmospheric particulate matter. Here, we determined the frequency and concentrations of 970 SVOCs in 48 air particle samples collected by means of high-volume air sampling in Hanoi, Vietnam, by using a target screening method and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry database. A total of 118 compounds (12.2% of the target compounds) were detected at least once in the samples, and the number of chemicals detected in each sample ranged from 85 to 103 (median, 92). For samples collected near a heavily trafficked road, the concentrations of target compounds in the samples were higher in samples collected during the day than in those collected at night, whereas the opposite was true for samples collected in a highly populated residential area with industrial activities related to the production of fresh noodles. Sixteen PAHs were detected at high concentrations in nearly 100% of the samples. Eighteen pesticides were detected, with permethrin being detected the most frequently (>70% samples), which can be explained by the use of permethrin-based Permecide 50 EC for dengue fever control during the sampling period. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (i.e., bisphenol A, 4-nitrophenol) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (diethyltoluamide, caffeine) were detected in over 90% of the samples. Seven sterols, five phthalate compounds and five organophosphorus flame retardants were detected in the samples. This is the first comprehensive survey of SVOCs adsorbed on atmospheric particulate matter in Vietnam, and as such, this study provides important new information about the frequency and concentrations of atmospheric SVOC contamination. The variety of chemicals detected in this study implies an abundance of pollution sources; further investigations to determine these pollution sources and the risks posed by the detected SVOCs to human health are warranted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AIQS; Air particle; Comprehensive analysis; GC-MS-MS; SVOC","Air quality; Endocrine disrupters; Flame retardants; Gas chromatography; Health risks; Mass spectrometry; Screening; Volatile organic compounds; AIQS; Comprehensive analysis; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; GC-MS-MS; Organophosphorus flame retardants; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs); SVOC; Particles (particulate matter); caffeine; diethyltoluamide; endocrine disruptor; flame retardant; organochlorine pesticide; organophosphate; permethrin; phthalic acid ester; plasticizer; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; rain; volatile organic compound; pesticide; aerosol; air quality; air sampling; atmospheric pollution; dengue fever; economic development; gas chromatography; health risk; mass spectrometry; particulate matter; phthalate; PPCP; public health; urban area; agriculture; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric particulate matter; commercial phenomena; contamination; dengue; industry; mass fragmentography; residential area; screening; season; Viet Nam; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; housing; human; procedures; Hanoi; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Housing; Humans; Particulate Matter; Pesticides; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Vietnam; Volatile Organic Compounds","","caffeine, 58-08-2; diethyltoluamide, 134-62-3, 26545-51-7; permethrin, 51877-74-8, 52645-53-1; Air Pollutants; Particulate Matter; Pesticides; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Volatile Organic Compounds","This study was supported by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (project code VAST.DLT10/17–18 ).

The extended four-node consecutive-interpolation quadrilateral element (XCQ4) used in this work is the conventional four-node quadrilateral element, but it is enhanced by additional terms of averaged nodal gradients to smoothen the derivative fields and increase the accuracy of solution, while keeping the same total number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) as that of the traditional element. Inspired by enrichment partition-of-unity method, the singularity and discontinuity of temperature, heat flux, and displacements due to the presence of crack are mathematically described through known enrichment functions. Once the stress fields are obtained, stress intensity factors (SIFs) can thus be evaluated by interaction integral technique. The SIFs are then used to predict crack growth direction. Unlike isotropic media, material orientation plays a critical role and that has to be considered when modeling the evolution of crack in orthotropic composite materials under thermo-mechanical loading condition. In addition, we introduce for the first time an improved way for the enriched approximation of discontinuous temperature field in cracked orthotropic media by taking into account the effect of material orientation. Several numerical examples for thermo-mechanical fracture problems in orthotropic composites with both isothermal and adiabatic loading conditions are analyzed to show the accuracy and performance of the present XCQ4. The computed results of the SIFs are compared with reference solutions derived from experiments, the standard extended four-node quadrilateral element (XQ4), and other numerical methods available in literatures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crack growth; Finite element; Fracture; Orthotropic materials; Thermo-elasticity","Composite materials; Crack propagation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Finite element method; Fracture; Heat flux; Interpolation; Numerical methods; Stress intensity factors; Crack-growth direction; Isothermal and adiabatic; Number of degrees of freedom; Orthotropic composite materials; Orthotropic materials; Partition of unity methods; Quadrilateral elements; Thermo-mechanical loading; Cracks","","","This research is funded by Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology - VNU-HCM, under Grant No. C2017-20-06 .

The results showed that Sponge-MBR exhibited effective removal of COD (94–98%) during the operation period despite increment of CIP concentrations from 20 to 200 µg L−1. The applied CIP dosage of 200 µg L−1 caused an inhibition of microorganisms in sponges, i.e. significant reduction of the attached biomass and a decrease in the size of suspended flocs. Moreover, this led to deteriorating the denitrification rate to 3–12% compared to 35% at the other lower CIP dosages. Importantly, Sponge-MBR reinforced the stability of CIP removal at various added CIP dosages (permeate of below 13 µg L−1). Additionally, the fouling rate at CIP dosage of 200 µg L−1 was 30.6 times lower compared to the control condition (no added CIP dosage). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ciprofloxacin; Dosage; Hospital wastewater; Sponge membrane bioreactor","Antibiotics; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Hospitals; Membrane fouling; Ciprofloxacin; Denitrification rate; Dosage; Effective removals; Hospital wastewater; Operation period; Sponge-membrane bioreactors; Treatment performance; Wastewater treatment; ciprofloxacin; nitrogen; antibiotics; bioreactor; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; inhibition; laboratory method; membrane; performance assessment; pollutant removal; sponge; suspended load; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; adsorption; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; biodegradation; biofouling; biomass; chlorination; controlled study; hospital waste; hydraulic retention time; membrane resistance; nonhuman; ozonation; particle size; photolysis; physical chemistry; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; sludge; waste component removal; chemistry; hospital; procedures; sewage; waste water; Biomass; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Ciprofloxacin; Waste Water","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank for the research grant from National Foundation for Science and Technology Development, Vietnam (NAFOSTED) No. 105.99-2015.16, Ministry of Science and Technology, Vietnam and Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea.

Correlation and regression analyses are applied to explore the relationships among research variables. The results indicate not only a significant linkage between multi-functional employees and manufacturing flexibility but also a positive relationship between management breadth of experience, task-related training for employees and multi-functional employees.

Beyond 15 GPa, octahedral-network is dominant. At pressure higher than 20 GPa, octahedral network tends to transform to crystalline phase (stishovite).

This issue has become more severe and increasingly occurred in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam. The main objective of this work is to map soil salinity intrusion in Ben Tre province located on the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band data combined with five state-of-the-art machine learning models, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN), Gaussian Processes (GP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forests (RF). For this purpose, 63 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 4-6 April 2018 corresponding to the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The performance of the five models was assessed and compared using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (r). The results revealed that the GP model yielded the highest prediction performance (RMSE = 2.885, MAE = 1.897, and r = 0.808) and outperformed the other machine learning models. We conclude that the advanced machine learning models can be used for mapping soil salinity in the Delta areas; thus, providing a useful tool for assisting farmers and the policy maker in choosing better crop types in the context of climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine learning; Mekong river delta; Sentinel; Soil salinity; Vietnam","Agriculture; Climate change; Climate models; Coefficient of performance; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mapping; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Radar imaging; Radial basis function networks; Rivers; Sea level; Soils; Synthetic aperture radar; Correlation coefficient; Mekong River; Multilayer perceptron neural networks; Radial basis function neural networks; Sentinel; Soil salinity; Support vector regression (SVR); Viet Nam; Machine learning","","","Funding: This research was funded by Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology through the project “Studying, Assessing, and Zoning Soil Salinity Intrusion by using Multi-temporal Satellite Imagery—A case study at Ben Tre province” (the grant number is VT-UD.03/16-20), which belongs to the National Program on Space Science and Technology (2016–2020).","Remote Sensing of Soil Salinization Impact on Land Management, (2009); Metternicht, Graciela I., Remote sensing of soil salinity: Potentials and constraints, Remote Sensing of Environment, 85, 1, pp. 1-20, (2003); FAO Soils Portal Management of Calcareous Soils, (2016); Allbed, Amal, Mapping and modelling spatial variation in soil salinity in the Al Hassa Oasis based on remote sensing indicators and regression techniques, Remote Sensing, 6, 2, pp. 1137-1157, (2014); Allbed, Amal, Assessing soil salinity using soil salinity and vegetation indices derived from IKONOS high-spatial resolution imageries: Applications in a date palm dominated region, Geoderma, 230-231, pp. 1-8, (2014); Douaoui, A., Detecting salinity hazards within a semiarid context by means of combining soil and remote-sensing data, Geoderma, 134, 1-2, pp. 217-230, (2006); Sidike, Ayetiguli, Estimating soil salinity in Pingluo County of China using QuickBirddata and soil reflectance spectra, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 26, 1, pp. 156-175, (2014); El-Harti, Abderrazak, Spatiotemporal monitoring of soil salinization in irrigated Tadla Plain (Morocco) using satellite spectral indices, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 50, pp. 64-73, (2016); Mashimbye, Zama Eric, Model-Based Integrated Methods for Quantitative Estimation of Soil Salinity from Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Selected South African Soils, Pedosphere, 22, 5, pp. 640-649, (2012); Weng, Yongling, A Spectral Index for Estimating Soil Salinity in the Yellow River Delta Region of China Using EO-1 Hyperion Data, Pedosphere, 20, 3, pp. 378-388, (2010)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060679688"

Fundamental processes of the interstitial-assisted mechanisms are systematically figured out, and specific values of the site energies are obtained with zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections.

Upon increasing the hydrogen concentration H/(V + M) higher than 0.5, the additional H atom prefers to reside at the tetrahedral (T) interstitial sites. The minimum energy paths of hydrogen diffusion are analyzed by the Nudged Elastic Band method with ZPE corrections. The site occupation energy and activation energy for each hydrogen diffusion path are found to be strongly influenced by the substitution of Mo or Cr into vanadium hydride. The results presented in this work indicate that the additional H prefers to migrate directly from T site to the nearest neighboring T site without crossing O site.

The key operating conditions were intermittent aeration for maintaining low dissolved oxygen concentrations (0.1–0.2 mg l−1) and alkalinity adjustment for obtaining pH values of 7.6–7.8. The effluent quality met Vietnamese husbandry wastewater standard for total nitrogen (<150 mg l−1 N). High chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration (>400 mg l−1) in the feed wastewater reduced ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity.

Then, a number of environmental issues are brought up in response to the master plan's implementation. Among the issues, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect that tends to cause negative impacts on people's heath becomes one major problem for exploitation to seek for mitigation solutions. In this paper, we investigate the land surface thermal signatures among different land-use types in Hanoi. The surface UHI (SUHI) that characterizes the consequences of the UHI effect is also studied and quantified. Note that our SUHI is defined as the magnitude of temperature differentials between any two land-use types (a more general way than that typically proposed in the literature), including urban and suburban. Relationships between main land-use types in terms of composition, percentage coverage, surface temperature, and SUHI in inner Hanoi in the recent two years 2016 and 2017, were proposed and examined. High correlations were found between the percentage coverage of the land-use types and the land surface temperature (LST). Then, a regression model for estimating the intensity of SUHI from the Landsat 8 imagery was derived, through analyzing the correlation between land-use composition and LST for the year 2017. The model was validated successfully for the prediction of the SUHI for another hot day in 2016. For example, the transformation of a chosen area of 161 ha (1.61 km 2 ) from vegetation to built-up between two years, 2016 and 2017, can result in enhanced thermal contrast by 3.3 °C. The function of the vegetation to lower the LST in a hot environment is evident. The results of this study suggest that the newly developed model provides an opportunity for urban planners and designers to develop measures for adjusting the LST, and for mitigating the consequent effects of UHIs by managing the land use composition and percentage coverage of the individual land-use type. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Land management unit; Land surface temperature; Land use; Surface urban heat island; Urban heat island","Atmospheric temperature; Landforms; Planning; Regression analysis; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Sustainable development; Thermal pollution; Vegetation; Different land use types; Environmental issues; Land managements; Land surface temperature; Surface temperatures; Surface urban heat islands; Temperature differential; Urban heat island; Land use","","","Funding text 1: Funding: Nguyen Thanh Hoan was funded by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) under project code: VAST01.05/16-17, and Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 105.08-2015.31.

The steady-state diffusion coefficients of polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000), trehalose, and keratin through eight archaeological waterlogged wood species were obtained from the total amounts of the chemicals diffused through the wood samples. The diffusion coefficients were strongly affected by the anatomical structures of the wood species and degree of wood deterioration. Within the same species of wood, the highest diffusion rates were measured in the longitudinal direction, followed by those in the radial and tangential directions. The longitudinal diffusion coefficients were 1.5- to 8.1-times higher than the radial diffusion coefficients, which were in turn approximately 1.1- to 5.7-times higher than the tangential diffusion coefficients. The diffusion rates were found to be inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the diffusing chemical. The diffusivity of trehalose through the waterlogged woods was found to be higher than those of keratin and PEG4000.

Due to their large void spaces, MOF structures tend to be more stable when the crystals are grown to form interpenetrated frameworks. Control of interpenetrated frameworks in MOFs is not only useful for various kinds of practical application but also provides insight towards understanding the reaction process and catenated behavior in MOF chemistry. In this research, we sought to investigate and successfully achieve reticular control of the interpenetration of PCN-280, a complex MOF with a 2-fold interpenetrated framework containing heterogeneity building blocks (two kinds of polytopic organic linking unit based on carboxylate), to form a new isoreticular single-frame MOF, termed MOF-908 and isoreticular MOF-909. The crystal structure and underlying network of MOF-908 and MOF-909 are proven by X-ray diffraction analysis as well as other related characterizations. Indeed, the mechanism of reticular control of the interpenetration of PCN-280 is studied in detail using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We extend our gratitude to Mr Long H.

Although there have been a large number of suspected CFP cases in the Southeast Asian countries, few were confirmed with causative ciguatoxins (CTXs), and reliable information on the symptoms still remains rather limited. In the present study, CTXs in red snapper Lutjanus bohar, implicated in two suspected CFP cases in Vietnam in 2014 and 2016, were determined by use of the single-quadrupole selected ion monitoring (SIM) liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Ciguatoxin-1B (CTX-1B), 54-deoxyCTX-1B, and 52-epi-54-deoxyCTX-1B were detected in the red snapper by our LC/MS method. Moreover, CTX-1B, 54-deoxyCTX-1B, and 52-epi-54-deoxyCTX-1B were further identified by the time of flight (TOF) LC/MS with the exact mass spectrum. The CTX profile of the red snapper in Vietnam is similar to those of ciguatera fish from Australia, Okinawa Islands in Japan, Kiribati, and Hong Kong. This is the first comprehensive report unambiguously identifying the causative toxins in fish implicated with reliable information on the poisoning symptoms in CFP in Vietnam and/or Southeast Asian countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP); Ciguatoxin-1B (CTX-1B); LC/MS; Red snapper; TOF; Vietnam","ciguatoxin; cyclooxygenase 1; DNA 16S; genomic DNA; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioassay; biofilm matrix; carbon metabolism; ciguatera; controlled study; DNA extraction; electrospray mass spectrometry; food poisoning; gastrointestinal symptom; genetic analysis; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; Lutjanus bohar; metabolomics; mouse; multiple reaction monitoring; neurologic disease; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; process optimization; quadrupole mass spectrometry; retention time; reversed phase liquid chromatography; temperature sense; time of flight mass spectrometry; animal; environmental monitoring; fish; food contamination; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; Viet Nam; Animals; Ciguatera Poisoning; Ciguatoxins; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Food Contamination; Mice, Inbred ICR; Vietnam","","ciguatoxin, 11050-21-8; Ciguatoxins","Funding: This work is the result of the VAST project KHCBBI.02/18-20 with respect of authors for great support from Academic Prof. Chau Van Minh, VAST president.","Marine Biotoxins, (2025); Lewis, Richard James, The changing face of ciguatera, Toxicon, 39, 1, pp. 97-106, (2001); Vilariño, Natalia, Human poisoning from marine toxins: Unknowns for optimal consumer protection, Toxins, 10, 8, (2018); Adachi, Rokuro, The Thecal Structure of a Marine Toxic Dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus gen. et sp. nov.

Our understanding of the α-cluster structure is, however, mainly limited to the self-conjugate A = 4n (n = 2, 3, 4, · · ·) light nuclei and some of the neutron-rich radionuclides such as 10Be, 11B, and 14C. In order to study the α-cluster structure of a neutron-deficient 22Mg nucleus, we have measured the 18Ne(α, α)18Ne scattering in inverse kinematics by using radioactive 18Ne beams and the 4He gas target at the Center for Nuclear Study radioactive ion beam separator of the University of Tokyo. Recoiling α particles from the scattering were detected by using silicon strip detectors, which constitute ΔE-E telescopes for particle identification. By adopting a thick target method, we were able to investigate a wide range of excitation energies E<inf>x</inf> = 9.9 - 16.5 MeV in 22Mg in this work. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inverse kinematics; Nuclear scattering; Nuclear structure; Radioactive ion beam; Spectroscopic study","","","","This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (No. NRF-2015R1D1A1A01056918, NRF-2016K1A3A7A09005579, NRF-2016R1A5A1013277, NRF-2017R1C1B2002120, NRF-2017R1D1A1B03030019 and NRF-2015H1A2A 1030275).

We also investigated the genetic diversity of norovirus GI and GII in oyster and wastewater samples by using pyrosequencing to evaluate the effect of urban drainage on norovirus contamination of oysters. A total of 34 oyster samples were collected at two sampling sites (stations A and B) in a lagoon. Norovirus GI was more frequently detected than GII (positive rate 79 vs. 41%). Maximum concentrations of GI and GII were 2.4 × 105 and 2.3 × 104 copies/g, respectively. Co-contamination with GI and GII was observed in 35% of samples. Norovirus GII concentration was higher at station A in the flood season than in the dry season (P = 0.04, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

In this paper, we introduce a method called LLMaxent which is the solution for the cross-domain suggestion classification. LLMaxent is a lifelong machine learning approach using maximum entropy (Maxent). In the course of lifelong learning, the drawn knowledge from the past tasks is retained and supported for the future learning. From that, we build a classifier by using labeled data in existed domains for suggestion classification in a new domain. The experimental results show that the proposed novel model can improve the performance of cross-domain suggestion classification. This is one of the preliminary research in lifelong machine learning using Maxent. Its effect is not only for suggestion classification but also for cross-domain text classification in general. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-domain suggestion classification; Lifelong learning; Maximum entropy; Suggestion mining","","","","This work was supported by the project QG.16.34 from Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU).","Berger, Adam L., A Maximum Entropy Approach to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, 22, 1, pp. 39-68, (1996); Research in Computing Science, (2013); Carlson, Andrew, Toward an Architecture for Never-Ending Language Learning, pp. 1306-1313, (2010); Caruana, Rich A., Multitask Learning, Machine Learning, 28, 1, pp. 41-75, (1997); Chen, Jianhui, Integrating low-rank and group-sparse structures for robust multi-task learning, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 42-50, (2011); International Conference on Machine Learning, (2014); Chen, Zhiyuan, Lifelong Machine Learning, Synthesis Lectures on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 10, 3, pp. 1-27, (2016); Lifelong Learning for Sentiment Classification, (2018); Annals of Mathematical Statistics, (1972); Dong, Li, The automated acquisition of suggestions from tweets, pp. 239-245, (2013)","","Instituto Politecnico Nacional revista@cic.ipn.mx","","","","","","14055546; 20079737","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069557567"

Relative to TiO<inf>2</inf>, the incorporation of Co into TiO<inf>2</inf> led to an increase in the adsorption ability against the paraquat. A possible mechanism of the paraquat degradation may be that the paraquat was selectively adsorbed onto the Co-TiO<inf>2</inf>/silica gel photocatalyst before light irradiation and after that the paraquat was continuously photodecomposed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adsorption and photocatalysis; Co-doped TiO2; paraquat; Silica gel supported","Adsorption; Catalysis; Doping (additives); Energy gap; Herbicides; Light; Photocatalysis; Silica; Silica gel; Solutions; Titanium dioxide; Adsorption ability; Co-doped; Enhanced adsorptions; Light irradiations; Mesoporous silica gel; paraquat; Photocatalytic activities; Possible mechanisms; Titanium compounds","","","The authors would like to thank the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST Asia Water Project) for the support and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST07.02/16-17 project) for the synthesized chemical support.","Haley, Thomas J., Review of the toxicology of paraquat (1, 1′dimethyl-4, 4′bipyridinium chloride), Clinical Toxicology, 14, 1, pp. 1-46, (1979); Grillo, Renato, Chitosan/tripolyphosphate nanoparticles loaded with paraquat herbicide: An environmentally safer alternative for weed control, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 278, pp. 163-171, (2014); Santos, Mónica S.F., Paraquat removal from water by oxidation with Fenton's reagent, Chemical Engineering Journal, 175, 1, pp. 279-290, (2011); Kang, Misook, Preparation of TiO2 photocatalyst film and its catalytic performance for 1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyidium dichloride decomposition, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 37, 3, pp. 187-196, (2002); Cantavenera, Maria Jlenia, Photocatalytic degradation of paraquat and genotoxicity of its intermediate products, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, 185, 2-3, pp. 277-282, (2007); Zhang, Qi, Dual-Mode Controlled Self-Assembly of TiO2 Nanoparticles Through a Cucurbit[8]uril-Enhanced Radical Cation Dimerization Interaction, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 54, 52, pp. 15789-15793, (2015); Zhang, Qi, Dynamic Self-Assembly Encodes A Tri-stable Au–TiO2 Photocatalyst, Advanced Materials, 29, 5, (2017); Chong, Meng Nan, Recent developments in photocatalytic water treatment technology: A review, Water Research, 44, 10, pp. 2997-3027, (2010); Khan, Mohammad Mansoob, Metal oxides as photocatalysts, Journal of Saudi Chemical Society, 19, 5, pp. 462-464, (2015); Khan, Mohammad Mansoob, Band gap engineered TiO2 nanoparticles for visible light induced photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic studies, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 2, 3, pp. 637-644, (2014)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","1543186X; 03615235","","JECMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031912976"

In particular, static stress intensity factors (SIFs) and transient dynamic responses of two-dimensional (2-D) stationary cracks in elastic solids under thermal and thermal-mechanical loadings are investigated. In addition, simulation of quasi-static crack propagation under thermal-mechanical loading condition is also performed. To precisely capture the singularity and discontinuity of temperature, heat flux, and displacements due to the presence of crack, the unknown field variables of mechanical displacements and temperature are approximated in terms of the XCQ4 framework by different enrichment strategies, which include either the use of the conventional branch functions or the new ramp function associated with Heaviside function. Only adiabatic condition is considered on the crack surfaces. For quasi-static crack growth analysis, the maximum hoop stress criterion, which is also valid for thermo-elastic fracture mechanics, is adopted. For transient crack analyses, the inertial effect is taken into account for the interaction integral in the consideration of DSIFs. Through eight numerical examples for thermoelastic fracture problems, the validity of the XCQ4 is confirmed by a comparison of the obtained results to those derived from different approaches in previous studies. In addition, the accuracy, performance, and superior advantages of the XCQ4 over standard extended finite element approach are also demonstrated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consecutive-interpolation; Crack growth; Enrichment; Fracture; Thermal shock; Thermoelasticity; XFEM","Blast enrichment; Crack propagation; Cracks; Dynamics; Finite element method; Fracture mechanics; Heat flux; Interpolation; Stress intensity factors; Thermal shock; Thermoelasticity; Elastic fracture mechanics; Extended finite elements; Interaction integrals; Mechanical displacements; Quadrilateral elements; Transient dynamic response; Two Dimensional (2 D); XFEM; Fracture","","","This research is funded by Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology - VNU-HCM, under grant number C2017-20-06 .

Model simulations were conducted for the SEA domain at 36 km spatial resolution for the period of 1989–2008, as part of the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling/Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-Southeast Asia (SEACLID/CORDEX-Southeast Asia) project. A total of 18 sensitivity experiments were conducted with a combination of six cumulus parameterization schemes and three ocean surface flux schemes. The model's skill in representing mean, maximum and minimum temperatures is evaluated against observed gridded data sets. Results indicate a predominant cold bias in all simulations, particularly over mainland SEA (Indochina) during the season of December to February. Nevertheless, the seasonal correlation is highest over this region. The cold bias of the model is also evident in the temperature distributions, such that there are more cold months than observed, which may be associated with the underestimation of the daily maximum temperature. A few simulations also reveal a warm bias over some areas in the Maritime Continent. Further examination shows that both radiative and surface fluxes influence the simulated temperature, which may also have effects that partially offset each other in some areas. Comparison of the sensitivity experiments reveals differences in model performance, and underlines the importance in choosing the appropriate configuration for RegCM4.3 before it is used to downscale climate projections, particularly for the SEA region. This study also shows a strong influence of the choice of cumulus scheme on temperature. Based on performance metrics for temperature among the schemes tested, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Emanuel cumulus scheme and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme version 1e (BATS1e) ocean surface flux scheme can be used in future simulations for the region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CORDEX; model evaluation; RegCM4; Southeast Asia; temperature","Climate models; Clouds; Surface measurement; Temperature; CORDEX; Cumulus parameterization schemes; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Model evaluation; RegCM4; Regional climate modeling; Southeast Asia; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; climate modeling; cumulus; parameterization; regional climate; sea surface; sensitivity analysis","","","Funding text 1: This research is funded by the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (ARCP2013-17NMY-Tangang/ST-2013-017, ARCP2014-07CMY-Tangang/ST-2015-003, ARCP2015-04CMY-Tangang/ST-2015-003).

In this study, we showed experimental evidence that proved that S. juventas root ethanolic extract has wound healing activities. First, in a mouse excision wound model, S. juventas root ethanolic extract at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the wound closure time. After 7 days, the wound granulation tissue in mice treated with the extract exhibited a 2.3-fold decrease in inflammatory cells, a 1.7-fold increase in fibroblasts and enhanced angiogenesis. Molecular analysis also revealed that after wounds were treated with S. juventas root ethanolic extract, TNF-α and NF-κB1 gene expression were down-regulated by 4.7 and 3.7 times, respectively. In contrast, TGF-β1 and VEGF gene expression were up-regulated by 1.9 and 6.5 times, respectively.

Numerous cores recovered from the subaerial delta reveal that it has prograded ~220 km southeastward within the past 7,500 years. Recent extensive seismic and geochemical surveys of the adjacent subaqueous delta indicate that the Mekong River forms a classic sigmoidal, cross-shelf clinoform immediately off its distributaries that is up to 15 m thick, with topset, foreset, and bottomset facies. These deposits are constrained within water depths of 20 m. Mekong-derived sediment packages extend ~300 km along shelf in the southwestward direction to the tip of the Ca Mau Peninsula, where they form a distal mud depocenter up to 22 m thick. These sediment packages can also be traced into the Gulf of Thailand to water depths of 25 m. The proximal and distal deposits cover ~11,000 km2 of the shelf. Historically, the Mekong Delta has prograded seaward at a mean rate of >30 m yr–1, or 7 km2 yr–1; however, study of the past 43 years of Landsat images indicates that the mode of sedimentation in the delta shifted starting in 2005. From 1973 to 2005, the Mekong Delta’s seaward shoreline growth decreased gradually from a mean of 7.8 m yr–1 to 2.8 m yr–1, and after 2005 it became negative, with a retreat rate of −1.4 m yr–1. The net deltaic land area gain has also been slowing, with the mean rate decreasing from 4.3 km2 yr–1 (1973–1979) to 1.0 km2 yr–1 (1995–2005), and then to −0.05 km2 yr–1 (2005–2015). Thus, in about 2005, the subaerial Mekong Delta transitioned from a constructive mode to an erosional (or destructive) mode. Furthermore, not only is the subaerial Mekong Delta land area gradually diminishing, but high-resolution CHIRP sonar profiling surveys off the east-central Ca Mau Peninsula reveal that this portion of the subaqueous delta is also eroding. With the construction of more dams, sand mining, delta subsidence, increasing storms, and sea level rise, the Mekong Delta will likely face more destructive changes, with erosion both of coastlines and underwater deposits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors are grateful for financial help and support from the US Office of Naval Research, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, NAFOSTED Vietnam project (105.01-2012.25), and give special thanks to the program managers for this project: Thomas G.

If some users would like to use various services, they have to repeatedly register. Therefore, they must remember all these information such as, user-names or passwords. To solve this problem, many authentication schemes in multi-server environment are proposed. Furthermore, to prevent the adversary from keeping track of another user when he or she logins, many schemes apply dynamic identity, but they have some limitations with popular kinds of attacks such as, replay attack, impersonation attack, or man-in-the-middle attack.. In 2014, Yeh (Department of Information Management, National Dong Hwa University) proposed multi-server scheme using Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA). However, we discover this scheme cannot achieve two basic properties, mutual authentication and session-key agreement. In this paper, we concretely demonstrate that discovery and propose a different provable version using elliptic curve cryptosystem in multi-server environment which overcomes the limitation of Yeh’s scheme and satisfies security and efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Authentication; Dynamic identity; Multi-server; User anonymity","Data communication systems; Information management; Network security; Dynamic identities; Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem; Internet based application; Man in the middle attacks; Multi-server; Multi-server environment; User anonymity; User authentication scheme; Authentication","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under Grant No. B2015-18-01.","Lamport, Leslie, Password Authentication with Insecure Communication, Communications of the ACM, 24, 11, pp. 770-772, (1981); Hwang, Minshiang, A new remote user authentication scheme using smart cards, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 46, 1, pp. 28-30, (2000); ElGamal, Taher, A Public Key Cryptosystem and a Signature Scheme Based on Discrete Logarithms, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 31, 4, pp. 469-472, (1985); Li, Lihua, A remote password authentication scheme for multiserver architecture using neural networks, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 12, 6, pp. 1498-1504, (2001); Juang, Wen Shenq, Efficient multi-server password authenticated key agreement using smart cards, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 50, 1, pp. 251-255, (2004); Chang, Chinchen Cheng, An efficient and secure multi-server password authentication scheme using smart cards, pp. 417-422, (2004); Proceedings of 2005 National Computer Symposium, (2005); Liao, Yipin, A secure dynamic ID based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environment, Computer Standards and Interfaces, 31, 1, pp. 24-29, (2009); Hsiang, Hancheng, Improvement of the secure dynamic ID based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environment, Computer Standards and Interfaces, 31, 6, pp. 1118-1123, (2009); Lee, Cheng Chi, A secure dynamic ID based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environment using smart cards, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 11, pp. 13863-13870, (2011)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","1572834X; 09296212","","WPCOF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010953409"

However, these forests have degraded rapidly in recent decades due to various human activities and natural disturbances. Thus, mangrove restoration programs have been widely initiated to prevent further forest loss and to mitigate climate change. The measurement of ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove forests will provide crucial information for the temporal reporting of C emissions in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes. The question whether restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon (OC) and ecosystem C storage has not been resolved for mangrove restoration programs. The present study, therefore, aimed to quantify ecosystem C storage and the contribution of organic matter sources to sedimentary OC in Kandelia obovata forests aged 9, 19 and 27 years; Sonneratia caseolaris forests aged 2 and 3 years, and a reference mudflat forest aged 0 from Hau Loc, North-Central Vietnam. The mean above- and below-ground C stocks of these forests ranged from 12.7±2.4 to 107.5±10.7MgCha−1, and 103.8±2.9 to 412.4±6.5MgCha−1, respectively. The ecosystem C storage of mangrove forests tended to increase with stand age, ranging from 201.3±4.3 to 519.9±12.5MgCha−1, with an overall mean of 310.3±21.3MgCha−1. The contribution of mangrove litter to sedimentary OC was between 45.8±0.8 and 64.1±1.5% along a forest chronosequence. The increase of the OC content and ecosystem C storage, and the proportional contributions of OC sources with forest age resulted from higher biomass production following forest development and the location of stands in the intertidal zone. These findings highlighted the importance of mangrove restoration programs in enhancing the ecosystem C storage and the sediment OC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon storage; Chronosequence; Organic carbon; Restored mangrove forests; Stable isotope; Vietnam","","","","This work was partially supported by Ehime University and by Japan and the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) under project number QG.16.16.

However, the importance of the bacterial community on growth performance of P. similis and B. rotundiformis culture is still unknown. In this study, the effect of limiting the bacterial growth and, as a second aim, the effect of the addition of a small amount of live or dead bacteria on the growth performance and microbial community (MC) of P. similis or B. rotundiformis culture was evaluated for a 10 day culture period. A rotifer culture with non-manipulated MC and fed autoclaved algae was used as the first control, and a culture started in autoclaved sea water and fed autoclaved algae was used as the second control. In order to test a feed effect, probiotics and other bacteria present in the culture system were killed (inhibited to grow) through the addition of an antibiotic mixture (AB) and the rotifer culture performance was compared to that of a culture to which live probionts were added. In the presence of the live probiotic mixture, both rotifers species showed a better growth performance than those without the presence of probiotic mixture or those with the AB added. In addition, the growth performance of the rotifer P. similis is more dependent on proliferating bacterial community than the rotifer B. rotundiformis. The supplementation of these probiotic bacteria not only increased the production of the rotifers, but also had a regulating effect on the microbiota. The bacterial density was below detection limit in TCBS, MRS agar and MA in all treatments using AB during the culture period for both rotifer species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brachionus rotundiformis; Growth performance; Microbial community; Proales similis; Probiotics; Rotifers","alga; bacterium; growth rate; microbial community; plankton; probiotics; seawater; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Brachionus rotundiformis; Proales; Rotifera","","","This study was financially supported by the Flemish Interuniversity Council Project (VLIR-IUC), grand number: ZIUS2015AP026, between Ghent University, Belgium and Hue University, Vietnam.

Chemical molecules having a linear alignment are commonly seen in nature, such as carbon dioxide. A similar linear alignment of the nuclear clusters, referred to as linear-chain cluster state (LCCS), has been studied since the 1950s, however, up to now there is no clear experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of such a state. Recently, it was proposed that an excess of neutrons may offer just such a stabilizing mechanism, revitalizing interest in the nuclear LCCS, specifically with predictions for their emergence in neutron-rich carbon isotopes. Here we present the experimental observation of α-cluster states in the radioactive 14C nucleus. Using the Be10+α resonant scattering method with a radioactive beam, we observed a series of levels which completely agree with theoretically predicted levels having an explicit linear-chain cluster configuration. We regard this as the first strong indication of the linear-chain clustered nucleus. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Linear-chain cluster state; Nuclear cluster; Resonant elastic scattering; RI beam; Thick-target method in inverse kinematics","","","","We appreciate Prof. Y.

In the last few years, combining multiple features from multi-modalities has proven to be an effective strategy for general multimedia event detection (MED), but the specific event detection like VSD has been comparatively less studied. Here, we evaluated the use of multiple features and their combination in a violent scenes detection system. We rigorously analyzed a set of low-level features and a deep learning feature that captures the appearance, color, texture, motion and audio in video. We also evaluated the utility of mid-level visual information obtained from detecting related violent concepts. Experiments were performed on the publicly available MediaEval VSD 2014 dataset. The results showed that visual and motion features are better than audio features. Moreover, the performance of the mid-level features was nearly as good as that of the low-level visual features. Experiments with a number of fusion methods showed that all single features are complementary and help to improve overall performance. This study also provides an empirical foundation for selecting feature sets that are capable of dealing with heterogeneous content comprising violent scenes in movies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-modal fusion; Multiple features; Video retrieval; Violent scenes detection","Image retrieval; Semantics; Empirical foundations; Low-level features; Mid-level features; Multi-modal fusion; Multimedia event detections; Multiple features; Video retrieval; Visual information; Feature extraction","","","This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under grant number B2013-26-01.","Tub Irml at Mediaeval 2014 Violent Scenes Detection Task Violence Modeling Through Feature Space Partitioning, (2014); Oneata D, (2013); Rocha A, (2014); Ionescu, Bogdan Emanuel, A naïve mid-level concept-based fusion approach to violence detection in Hollywood movies, pp. 215-222, (2013); Bosch, Anna, Scene classification via pLSA, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3954 LNCS, pp. 517-530, (2006); Bosch, Anna, Image classification using random forests and ferns, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, (2007); Burghouts, Gertjan J., Performance evaluation of local colour invariants, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 113, 1, pp. 48-62, (2009); Pcsc, (2005); Lleida E, (2014); Gros P 2011 Technicolor and Inria Irisa at Mediaeval, (2011)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","13807501; 15737721","","MTAPF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975742233"

Dioxins may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases in part via by affecting expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and inflammatory cytokines in animal models. As the role of the Ahr in dioxin-exposed people is not well defined, a study was conducted to examine gene expression levels of Ahr, inflammatory cytokines, and the incidence of diseases in dioxin-exposed citizens who had/still resided near a heavily dioxin-contaminated area in Vietnam. Whole blood from citizens at/around Da Nang airbase and control individuals living in unsprayed areas was collected. Serum levels of dioxins were analyzed by using a dioxins-responsive chemical-activated luciferase gene expression bioassay. Gene expression of Ahr, interleukin (IL)-1b, TNFa, IL-6, and IL-22 in whole blood was examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed levels of dioxins and expression of Ahr, IL-1b, TNFa, and IL-6 were up-regulated while IL-22 expression was downregulated in dioxin-exposed people. Various disease incidences in the study subjects was also examined. Interestingly, the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in these individuals was increased compared to the estimated prevalence of this disease in the general Vietnamese population. Analyses also showed that expression levels of Ahr correlated to those of IL-6 and IL-22 in the dioxin-exposed people. Taken together, dioxins might be involved in an up-regulated expression of Ahr that might possibly relate to changes in level of inflammatory cytokines and, ultimately, in the incidence of select diseases in residents of Vietnam who had/continue to live near a dioxins-contaminated site. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Da Nang airbase; Dioxin receptor; Dioxins; Inflammatory cytokines; Rheumatoid arthritis","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; beta actin; cytokine; dioxin; interleukin 22; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; tumor necrosis factor; autacoid; carcinogen; transcriptome; adult; Article; blood; female; gene expression; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; rheumatoid arthritis; upregulation; Vietnamese; young adult; aged; chemically induced; environmental exposure; genetics; incidence; metabolism; middle aged; prevalence; Viet Nam; war; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Carcinogens; Cytokines; Dioxins; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Incidence; Inflammation Mediators; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Transcriptome; Vietnam; Vietnam Conflict","","interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; Carcinogens; Cytokines; Dioxins; Inflammation Mediators; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon","This work was supported by Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (project VAST02.01/15–16 for Nam Trung Nguyen).","Acosta Rodríguez, E.

This study assesses the spectral separability of canopies of common mangrove species in Southern Vietnam using a large sample-set of field measurements of hyperspectral reflectance. Although data collection has been conducted under consistent calibration and stable geometric set-ups, field spectroscopy deals with significant and multitudinous environmental noises compared to laboratory spectroscopic setups. Field measurements of canopies are however believed to hold greater relevancy for UAV, airborne and satellite remote sensing due a closer resemblance of real-world intra-specific variation and environmental determinants. The present study shows that the large sample-set of hyperspectral data recorded in the field provides a sound base for discrimination common mangrove species in Southern Vietnam - identifying the visible and red-edge as a key regions for species discrimination.

However, in the lower-energy terahertz (THz) region, sensing by detecting molecular vibrations is still challenging because of low sensitivity, complicated spectral features, and relatively little accumulated knowledge of molecules. Here, we report the use of a micron-scale thin-slab metamaterial (MM) architecture, which functions as an amplifier for enhancing the absorption signal of the THz vibration of an ultrathin adsorbed layer of large organic molecules. We examined bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a prototype large protein molecule and Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) and 3,3′-diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DTTCI) as examples of small molecules. Among them, our MM significantly magnified only the signal strength of bulky BSA. On the other hand, DTTCI and Rh6G are inactive, as they lack low-frequency vibrational modes in this frequency region. The results obtained here clearly demonstrate the promise of MM-enhanced absorption spectroscopy in the THz region for detection and structural monitoring of large biomolecules such as proteins or pathogenic enzymes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine; benzothiazole derivative; bovine serum albumin; carbocyanine; protein; rhodamine; rhodamine 6G; silicon; silver; chemistry; devices; procedures; terahertz spectroscopy; vibration; Benzothiazoles; Carbocyanines; Proteins; Rhodamines; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Silicon; Silver; Terahertz Spectroscopy; Vibration","","protein, 67254-75-5; rhodamine 6G, 989-38-8; silicon, 7440-21-3; silver, 7440-22-4; 3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine; Benzothiazoles; Carbocyanines; Proteins; rhodamine 6G; Rhodamines; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Silicon; Silver","The authors at IMS-VAST acknowledge the financial support of projects VAST03.03/15-16 and VAST03.02/15- 16, which were sponsored by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam.

The study was carried out as part of the International Pellet Watch program for monitoring the global distribution of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Higher levels of DDTs compared to PCBs indicated agricultural inputs rather than industrial discharges in the region. Most POP concentrations on both beaches decreased over the period, with the exception of HCH isomers. Though the concentration of DDTs showed a drastic decline on both beaches between 2007/2008 and 2014, DDTs accounted for 60–80% of total DDTs, suggesting that there is still a fresh input of these chemicals in the region.

Previous measurements of the condensation rate were mainly based on the optical visualization. In the paper, the development of a new method that uses two ultrasonic frequencies for the measurement of the condensation rate in subcooled boiling is presented. The ultrasonic velocity profile (UVP) method is used for the velocity measurement. Two simultaneous UVP measurements by the two frequencies are exploited. The principle of the new condensation-rate-measurement method is established. In the method, the UVP data of the bubble surface velocity are used. In subcooled boiling, the bubble-surface velocity is affected by the condensation. The UVP measurement must capture correctly the condensation effect on the bubble-surface velocity. In order to confirm the applicability of the UVP method to the measurement of the surface velocity in this case, the growth rate of air bubbles from a nozzle submerged in water is measured and compared with the result of optical visualization and digital image processing. Such growth process is analogous to that of vapor bubbles in a boiling process, and it is the inverse of the condensation process. Evaluation of the new condensation-rate-measurement method is carried out by the measurements of adiabatic air-water-bubbly column and subcooled pool boiling in vertical round tube. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Condensation rate; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Optical visualization; Subcooled boiling; Ultrasonic velocity profile measurement","Air; Heat transfer; Image processing; Inverse problems; Mass transfer; Optical data processing; Ultrasonic velocity; Ultrasonic velocity measurement; Ultrasonic waves; Velocity; Visualization; Condensation effects; Condensation process; Condensation rates; Heat and mass transfer; Optical visualization; Sub-cooled boiling; Ultrasonic frequency; Ultrasonic velocity profiles; Condensation","","","The first author would like to express his sincere thanks to Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( JSPS ) for financial support, in the JSPS Ronpaku PhD Program, to carry out this study in the Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors, Tokyo Institute of Technology .

This virus, designated Okushiri virus (OKV), replicated in the Aedes albopictus cell line C6/36 with severe cytopathic effects and produced a large number of spherical viral particles that were 50-70 nm in diameter and released into the cell culture medium. The OKV genome consisted of 9,704 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tail at the 3′-terminus, and contained three major open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3). ORF1 encoded a putative protein of approximately 268 kDa that included a methyltransferase domain, FtsJ-like methyltransferase domain, helicase domain, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain. The genome organization and results of a phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence indicated that OKV is a member of a new insect virus group of negeviruses with a possible evolutionary relationship to some plant viruses. ORF2 and ORF3 were suggested to encode hypothetical membrane-associated proteins of approximately 45 kDa and 22 kDa, respectively. This is the first study on a novel negevirus isolated from mosquito larvae in Japan. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","virus protein; virus RNA; Aedes; amino acid sequence; animal; animal dispersal; cell line; classification; cytopathogenic effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; insect virus; isolation and purification; Japan; metabolism; molecular genetics; phylogeny; physiology; RNA virus; virology; virus genome; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal Distribution; Animals; Cell Line; Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Genome, Viral; Insect Viruses; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; RNA Viruses; RNA, Viral; Viral Proteins","","RNA, Viral; Viral Proteins","This work was supported in part by JSPS and VAST under the Japan-Vietnam Research Cooperation Program.","Adams, Michael J., Ratification vote on taxonomic proposals to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (2014), Archives of Virology, 159, 10, pp. 2831-2841, (2014); Auguste, Albert Jonathan, Characterization of a novel Negevirus and a novel Bunyavirus isolated from Culex (Culex) declarator mosquitoes in Trinidad, Journal of General Virology, 95, PART 2, pp. 481-485, (2014); Altschul, Stephen F., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs, Nucleic Acids Research, 25, 17, pp. 3389-3402, (1997); Becnel, J.

It also provides about one third of the total water demand for residents of Ho Chi Minh City (HCM). However, due to rapid urbanization and frequent discharges of untreated urban wastewater to surface water, freshwater is widely contaminated by man-made chemicals, which may result in groundwater pollution. As part of an ongoing campaign to collect baseline information on the occurrence of organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) in the aquatic environment in Vietnam, 43 water samples were collected from 26 groundwater wells in HN (22) and HCM (4) in September 2013 and August 2014. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the resulting chromatograms were screened for 940 OMPs by an automated identification and quantification system (AIQS) within a GC-MS database. A total of 74 compounds were detected, with between 4 and 43 (median 18) compounds found at each site. Overall, contamination levels were low, with over 89 % of the detected concentrations that were less than 0.5 μg L−1. Results suggest that most of the sampled aquifers have been impacted by non-point source pollution. Most of the contaminants detected are either currently not regulated in drinking water or are present at low levels. A health risk assessment for detected contaminants implied that there were no risks to humans. Since this study was based on a limited number of samples, especially in HCM, further, more detailed studies on the occurrence of OMPs in groundwater in HCM and a full risk assessment of detected contaminants should be prioritized. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comprehensive analysis; GC-MS; Groundwater; Occurrence; Organic micro-pollutants","drinking water; gas chromatography; groundwater pollution; mass spectrometry; nonpoint source pollution; organic pollutant; urbanization; water quality; Hanoi; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam; dangerous goods; ground water; organic compound; waste water; water pollutant; well water; analysis; chemistry; city; human; mass fragmentography; Cities; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Groundwater; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Organic Chemicals; Urbanization; Vietnam; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Wells","","Hazardous Substances; Organic Chemicals; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This study was supported by a bilateral joint research project between the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS, project no. 12308030) and the Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology (VAST, project code VAST.HTQT.NHAT.01/2012–2014), and a research grant from Kitakyushu City, Japan.

Twenty-eight river water and 22 groundwater samples collected in four major cities and 14 river water samples from the Red River were screened to investigate the occurrence and sources of 16 PFAAs. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were the most prevalent of 11 detected PFAAs with maximum concentrations in urban river water of 5.3, 18 and 0.93ngL-1, respectively, and in groundwater of 8.2, 4.5 and 0.45ngL-1, respectively. PFAAs in the Red River water were detected at low levels. PFAA concentrations in river water were higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, possibly due to storm water runoff, a common phenomenon in Southeast Asian countries. The highest concentrations of PFAAs in river water were observed in samples from highly populated and industrialized areas, perhaps sourced from sewage. The PFAA concentrations observed were similar to those in other Southeast Asian countries, but lower than in developed nations.

The DT1 core (105°38′51″E, 10°17′02″N, elevation +. 2. m) is 51.5. m long and located in fill of a buried incised valley. This incised valley of the Paleo-Mekong River formed during the last glacial maximum, which is 20-30. km wide, has been traced spatially from the Cambodian border to the South China Sea coast by compilation of existing core data. The DT1 core records the history of the estuarine channel and delta systems of the Mekong River during the early to middle Holocene. The sedimentary facies, determined particularly from sedimentary structures, diatom and foraminifera assemblages, grain-size variation, and the accumulation rate, clearly show an upward-deepening succession in the lower part of the core from marsh or intertidal flat to subtidal-inner bay facies and an overlying upward-shallowing succession from prodelta to intertidal flat-floodplain. The boundary between the two successions, indicating the maximum flooding surface, occurred at approximately 8.0. ka, at the time that the Mekong River delta was initiated. The delta initiation and sediment facies succession are closely linked to Holocene sea-level changes, particularly a standstill from 8.0 to 7.5. ka after a rapid rise of sea level from 8.8 to 8.2. ka. During the further sea-level rise from 7.5 to 7.0. ka, sediments aggraded, forming topset sedimentary deposits. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accumulation rate; Delta initiation; Diatom; Sea-level rise; Sedimentary facies","Accumulation rates; Delta initiation; Diatom; Sea level rise; Sedimentary facies; Anoxic sediments; Coastal zones; Landforms; Rivers; Sea level; Sedimentology; accumulation rate; core analysis; deltaic deposit; deltaic sedimentation; facies analysis; formation mechanism; geomorphological response; grain size; Holocene; incised valley; Last Glacial Maximum; microfossil; radiocarbon dating; sea level change; sediment core; sedimentary structure; size distribution; Mekong River; Bacillariophyta; Foraminifera","","","This work was supported by the NAFOSTED of Vietnam and was a part of a collaborative project among the Institute of Resources Geography (Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology), the Geological survey of Japan, and the Department of Geology, Niigata University Japan.

The electrochemical behavior of dopamine was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. By using a PMeT-modified glassy carbon (GC/PMeT) electrode, DA and Ascorbic Acid (AA) signals could be separated but the AA at high concentrations still caused significant interference by overlapping the DA peak. In comparison to the GC/PMeT electrode, the glassy carbon (GC/Nafion/PMeT) electrode modified with hybrid film Nafion/PMeT was found to permit a superior separation by shifting the oxidation of AA peak toward the less positive potential. The DPV curves for a mixture of DA and AA at an GC/Nafion/PMeT electrode in a 0.1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> solution showed peaks of DA and AA, at 0.45 and 0.21 V, respectively, indicating that the difference in the oxidation potential was 240 mV. In the 0.1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> solution, the oxidation peak current on the differential pulse voltammograms for the GC/PMeT electrode increased linearly with the concentration of DA in the range 1 × 10-6 to 1 × 10-3 M, and the oxidation peak current on the differential pulse voltammograms for the GC/Nafion/PMeT electrode in the range 5 × 10-7 to 2 × 10-4 M. The DA detection sensitivity of the GC/Nafion/PMeT electrode (26.7 μA μM-1 cm-2) was 22 times higher than that of the GC/PMeT electrode (1.21 μA μM-1 cm-2). © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ascorbic acid; Dopamine; Electrochemical; Nafion; Polymethylthiophene","Ascorbic acids; Concentration of; Detection sensitivity; Differential pulse voltammetry; Differential pulse voltammograms; Electroactive; Electrochemical behaviors; High concentration; Hybrid film; Modified glassy carbon electrode; Oxidation peak; Oxidation potentials; Poly(3-methylthiophene) (pMeT); Positive potential; Selective detection; Voltammetric analysis; Bioelectric phenomena; Brain; Cyclic voltammetry; Glass membrane electrodes; Ketones; Organic acids; Oxidation; Glassy carbon","","","Acknowledgements The authors thank the Core University Program between the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST).

Concentrations of total As in groundwater were 0.7-502 μg/l. Total As levels in groundwater drastically decreased by using sand filter, indicating that the filter could be effective to remove As from raw groundwater. Concentrations of inorganic As (IAs) in urine and total As in hair of males were higher than those of females. A significant positive correlation between monomethylarsonic acid (MMA)/IAs and age in females indicates that older females have higher methylation capacity from IAs to MMA. Body mass index negatively correlated with urinary As concentrations in males. Homozygote for SNPs 4602AA, 35991GG, and 37853GG, which showed strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), had higher percentage (%) of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in urine. SNPs 4740 and 12590 had strong LD and associated with urinary %DMA. Although SNPs 6144, 12390, 14215, and 35587 comprised LD cluster, homozygotes in SNPs 12390GG and 35587CC had lower DMA/MMA in urine, suggesting low methylation capacity from MMA to DMA in homo types for these SNPs. SNPs 5913 and 8973 correlated with %MMA and %DMA, respectively. Heterozygote for SNP 14458TC had higher MMA/IAs in urine than TT homozygote, indicating that the heterozygote may have stronger methylation ability of IAs. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the association of genetic factors with As metabolism in Vietnamese. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Arsenic levels in groundwater ranged from <1.8 to 486 μg/L. Remarkably, 86% of groundwater samples exceeded WHO drinking water guideline of 10 μg/L. Also, estimated inorganic As intake from groundwater and rice were over Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (15 μg/week/kg body wt.) by FAO/WHO for 92% of the residents examined. Inorganic As and its metabolite (monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) concentrations in human urine were positively correlated with estimated inorganic As intake. These results suggest that residents in these areas are exposed to As through consumption of groundwater and rice, and potential health risk of As is of great concern for these people.
