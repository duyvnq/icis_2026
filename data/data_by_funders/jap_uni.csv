It has a wide range of applications, including gate optimization, quantum-assisted compiling, quantum state preparation, and quantum dynamic simulation. Traditional quantum compilation usually optimizes circuits for a single target. However, many quantum systems require simultaneous optimization of multiple targets, such as thermal state preparation, time-dependent dynamic simulation, and others. To address this, we develop a multi-target quantum compilation algorithm to improve the performance and flexibility of simulating multiple quantum systems. Our benchmarks and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, highlighting the importance of multi-target optimization in advancing quantum computing. This work lays the groundwork for further development and evaluation of multi-target quantum compilation algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","genetic algorithm; quantum architecture search; quantum compilation; quantum optimization","Benchmarking; Genetic algorithms; Program compilers; Quantum efficiency; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Targets; Compilation algorithms; Multi-targets; Optimisations; Quantum architecture; Quantum architecture search; Quantum circuit; Quantum compilation; Quantum optimization; Quantum state preparation; Unitary operation; Quantum computers","","","L B H thanks Dr Sahel Ashhab for the fruitful discussions.

In this study, we analyzed the drivers for this trend by targeting wild paddy field plants in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Surveys were conducted on the use, domestication status, and market status of plants, and cultivation skill of the growers in Vientiane Municipality/Province and Houaphan Province, by targeting 171 market vendors and 54 growers, in 2013–2019 and 2022. A total of 31 paddy field plants were used as vegetables, of which 7 were grown. Centella asiatica, Limnophila chinensis, Limnophila geoffrayi, and Houttuynia cordata have been grown since the 2000s for selling at local markets, and because of demand for safe and healthy vegetables, time saved in traveling to harvesting sites, or ease of cultivation. The possible drivers for growing them were the preference for wild foods in Lao dietary culture, emerging concerns about agricultural chemical use on commercially produced vegetables, increased trade of wild plants at local markets, the ease with which these plants can be vegetatively propagated, and their resistance to pests and diseases. The results of this study have implications for food security, plant conservation, and domestication research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dietary culture; Domestication; Food preference; Local market; Wild edible plants","","","","Funding text 1: The authors wish to express profound gratitude to Dr. Lamphoune Xayvongsa in the Faculty of Forestry Science, National University of Laos, and the officers of the Provincial and District Offices of Agriculture and Forestry in Vientiane and Houaphan Province, Lao PDR.

Accurately analyzing the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is therefore necessary for sustainable forest management and climate change mitigation. Previous studies explored the potential of random forest (RF) in modeling forest SOCD using various environmental data sources. However, how forest SOCD prediction would be affected by using random forest regression kriging (RFRK), which integrates the predictive power of RF in generating deterministic trends and the capability of the ordinary kriging (OK) in handling spatial autocorrelation structure of residuals, based on the environmental data sources and their combinations remains elusive and deserves further exploration. For this purpose, 104 soil samples were collected at a depth of 30 cm in forest ecosystems of Central Vietnam, and 33 environmental covariates were derived from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (AL2) imagery, digital elevation model (DEM), and climatic data. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to evaluate and compare the model performances, four metrics, including coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative improvement (RI), were calculated. The results showed that enhanced RFRK performance for forest SOCD estimation was found with the inclusion of additional environmental data sources, with RFRK based on all data sources achieving a high accuracy (R2 = 0.78, MAE = 8.28 t·ha−1, and RMSE = 10.54 t·ha−1). The comparison of the RF and RFRK models exhibited that additionally interpolated residuals by OK were more accurate than only considering the influences of predictor covariates. The relative improvement of the RFRK models over the RF models in forest SOCD estimation was notable, with RIR<inf>2</inf> ranging from 8.20 to 65.00%, RI<inf>MAE</inf> ranging from 8.18 to 21.07%, and RI<inf>RMSE</inf> ranging from 6.76 to 18.18%. The result from our case study emphasizes the robustness of RFRK using S2, AL2, DEM, and climatic data in accurately predicting forest SOCD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital soil mapping; Forest ecosystems; Multi-source environmental data; Random forest regression kriging; Soil organic carbon density","data; digital mapping; forest ecosystem; kriging; modeling; organic carbon; regression analysis; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; Viet Nam","","","Open Access funding provided by Okayama University.","Abbaszad, Parya, Evaluation of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 vegetation indices to predict soil organic carbon using machine learning models, Modeling Earth Systems and Environment, 10, 2, pp. 2581-2592, (2024); AlaviPanah, Seyed Kazem, The Shadow Effect on Surface Biophysical Variables Derived from Remote Sensing: A Review, Land, 11, 11, (2022); Ameray, Abderrahmane, Forest Carbon Management: a Review of Silvicultural Practices and Management Strategies Across Boreal, Temperate and Tropical Forests, Current Forestry Reports, 7, 4, pp. 245-266, (2021); García-Asuero, Agustín García, The correlation coefficient: An overview, Critical Reviews in Analytical Chemistry, 36, 1, pp. 41-59, (2006); Ayele, Gebiaw T., Terrain effects on the spatial variability of soil physical and chemical properties, Soil Systems, 4, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Balzter, Heiko, Forest mapping and monitoring with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Progress in Physical Geography, 25, 2, pp. 159-177, (2001); Benesty, Jacob, On the importance of the pearson correlation coefficient in noise reduction, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 16, 4, pp. 757-765, (2008); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Brownstein, Gretchen E., Chance in plant communities: A new approach to its measurement using the nugget from spatial autocorrelation, Journal of Ecology, 100, 4, pp. 987-996, (2012); Brus, D.

Using a GIS-based Analytic Hierarchy Process with multi-criteria decision-making (AHP-MCDM), this research integrates stakeholders’ opinions, environmental considerations, and technical factors to assess land suitability for wind energy development. The analysis reveals that Jamaica has the potential to increase its wind power output by 8.99% compared to the current production of 99 MW. This expansion could significantly contribute to offsetting fossil fuel-based energy consumption and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It identifies sites across several parishes, including Westmoreland, Clarendon, St. Mary, and St. James, as highly suitable for utility-scale wind farm development.

This, together with increased climate-change-driven hazards, and deplorable slum characteristics has led to considerably higher flood impacts in slum settlements. As such, there is a need for specialized flood vulnerability assessment tools that integrate features specific to the urban slums. Studies have consecrated efforts to integrated and multidimensional flood vulnerability studies. However, assessments that include social, economic, structural, and institutional realities of the slum settlements are rare in developing countries. This study comprehensively assessed the flood vulnerability in urban slums. It offers a simplified perspective of vulnerability in urban slums, capturing data from slum inhabitants, local councils, experts, and local NGOs since they often have profound insights into essential service availability, access, and quality within the study area. Utilizing data encompassing 40 indicators (exposure, susceptibility, and resilience), we assess the physical/structural, social, and economic/psychological vulnerability indices for slum households and the institutional vulnerability of 41 entities. Despite significant challenges of poor infrastructure and lack of basic disaster management tools, slum residents have developed recognizable strategies to overcome flooding. Institutions carrying out intervention activities in the slums were largely incompetent and plagued with challenges ranging from lack of technical know-how to access to funds and coordination. Finally, a significant gap exists between state efforts and the impacts of these efforts on the residents of these slums. These findings complement household-level data and provide an expanded understanding of vulnerability patterns, thus informing policymakers about interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flood vulnerability index (FVI); Household surveys; Resilience; Risk communication; Urban slums","","","","This work was supported by the Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology, and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), the Research Unit for Realization of Sustainable Society (RURSS) at Kyoto University, and the JSPS Core-to-Core Program (Grant Number: JPJSCCB20220004).

Firstly, the atomic structures of Mo<inf>2</inf>C-MXenes are optimized, and their respective structures are created with comparative research. Secondly, their electronic band structures and optical properties are studied in detail. The estimation of the bandgap energy of Mo<inf>2</inf>C-MXenes with its functionalization reveal that most Mo<inf>2</inf>CF<inf>2</inf> and Mo<inf>2</inf>C(OH)<inf>2</inf> layers are semiconductors, while Mo<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>2</inf> behaves as a metal.

Our objective is to convert this temperature difference into electric power for using in wireless IoT sensing systems. Nineteen thermoelectric generators (TEG-12708) were evaluated in a laboratory environment to determine their internal resistance and corresponding load resistance for experimental energy surveys in greenhouses. The maximum output power reached 699.38 µW when the temperature difference across the TEG was 3°C. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated a sensing system driven by the realistic ambient temperature environment by integrating the TEG with other electronic components, including a DC-DC converter, power management circuit, supercapacitor, and sensors. Under aqua-greenhouse conditions, the harvested temperature difference across the TEG was 3.5°C, corresponding to the TEG’s output power of 0.55 mW. The output of the DC-DC converter could reach over 8 V.

As a result, the metal transfer frequency of solid wire was monotonically decreased with the CO<inf>2</inf> content owing to an increase in the arc pressure, which prevented droplet detachment. However, the metal transfer frequency of the metal-cored wire presented a maximum value at 15% CO<inf>2</inf> under all the current levels. The transfer behavior was supposed to depend on the relation between the arc attachment position and the tip of the unmelted flux position inside the cored wire. When the CO<inf>2</inf> concentration was low, the arc was attached higher than the unmelted flux, causing the electromagnetic force to be ineffective in droplet separation. When the CO<inf>2</inf> concentration increased slightly, the arc was moved downward to the tip of the unmelted flux. That tendency temporarily facilitated the neck formation at the wire tip due to enhanced electromagnetic force flowing through the molten metal on the wire tip. Nevertheless, when the CO<inf>2</inf> content increased over a critical value, the arc pressure became a dominant factor to hinder the droplet detachment, which caused a decrease in transfer frequency.

Multi-center studies offer an excellent framework for this purpose, but they present various methodological and logistical problems. This contribution illustrates the experience of the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network, an international collaboration working on a global research program on the associations between environmental stressors, climate, and health in a multi-center setting. The article illustrates the collaborative scheme based on mutual contribution and data and method sharing, describes the collection of a huge multi-location database, summarizes published research findings and future plans, and discusses advantages and limitations. The Multi-Country Multi-City represents an example of a collaborative research framework that has greatly contributed to advance knowledge on the health impacts of climate change and other environmental factors and can be replicated to address other research questions across various research fields. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air pollution; Climate change; Environmental epidemiology; Multi-city; Temperature; Time series; Two-stage","air pollution; Article; climate; climate change; environment; environmental factor; environmental risk; environmental temperature; excess mortality; health; health hazard; human; mortality risk","","","The MCC Collaborative Research Network: Antonio Gasparrini, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK; Michelle Bell, Yale University, New Haven CT, USA; Yuming Guo, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; Yasushi Honda, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan; Veronika Huber, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany; Jouni J.

By utilizing wide-bandgap p-type GaN, the β-Ga<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> JBS diodes demonstrate a turn-on voltage (V <inf>on</inf>) of approximately 0.8 V. Moreover, a breakdown voltage (V <inf>br </inf>) of 880 V and a specific on-resistance (R <inf>on,sp </inf>) of 3.96 mΩ·cm2 are achieved, resulting in a Baliga’s figure of merit (BFOM) of approximately 0.2 GW /cm 2. A forward current density of 465 A cm−2 at a forward voltage of 3 V is attained. The simulated reverse leakage current density remains low at 9.0 mA cm−2 at 800 V. Floating field rings, in conjunction with junction termination extension (JTE), were utilized as edge termination methods to attain a high breakdown voltage. The impact of β-Ga<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> periodic fin width fluctuations on the electrical characteristics of JBS was investigated. Due to the enhanced sidewall depletion effect caused by p-type GaN, the forward current (I <inf>F</inf>) and reverse current (I <inf>R</inf>) decrease when the β-Ga<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> periodic fin width decreases. The findings of this study indicate the remarkable promise of p-GaN/n-Ga<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> JBS diodes for power device applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","gallium nitride; gallium oxide; high breakdown voltage; junction barrier Schottky; superior performance","Analog circuits; Design for testability; Electric breakdown of liquids; Electric breakdown of solids; Gallium nitride; Heterodyning; Heterojunctions; Integrated circuit design; Leakage currents; PIN diodes; Power semiconductor diodes; Schottky barrier diodes; Wide band gap semiconductors; Design and evaluations; Fin widths; Forward currents; Gallium oxides; High breakdown voltage; Junction Barrier Schottky; Junction barrier Schottky diodes; P-type; Performance; Superior performance; III-V semiconductors","","","The authors would like to thank Prof. Cong-Kha Pham of the University of Electro\u2014Communications (UEC), Tokyo, Japan and VLSI Design and Education Center (VDEC), the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan for supporting simulation tools.

The difference in keyhole profile and bead formation, when the GMA shielding gas was pure Ar, Ar + 2% O<inf>2</inf>, or Ar + 20% CO<inf>2</inf>, was investigated for plate thicknesses of 6 and 9 mm for the first time. It was found that the weld beads were in good condition for 6 mm thickness plates for all shielding gases, which implied that the window of welding conditions for this thickness is wide. In contrast, for 9 mm thickness plates, a fully penetrated weld bead was achieved only in Ar + 20% CO<inf>2</inf>, and weld bead penetration in Ar + 20% CO<inf>2</inf> is higher than in pure Ar and Ar + 2% O<inf>2</inf> in the same welding condition. Due to decreased surface tension caused by sufficiently increased oxygen absorbed into the weld pool, the keyhole diameter increased to penetrate the bottom side of the plate, and the depressing weld pool surface under GMA allowed the heat input from the GMA to be directly applied to a deeper position. Consequently, the plasma-GMA hybrid welding process with Ar + 20% CO<inf>2</inf> achieved a complete penetration for a plate of 9 mm thickness, owing to the effects of both phenomena. It proved a potential to increase penetrability in welding thicker plates by controlling oxygen content in shielding gas of GMA adequately. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gas composition; High-tensile strength steel; Oxygen; Plasma keyhole; Plasma-GMA hybrid welding; Shielding gas; Surface tension","Argon; High strength steel; Laser beam welding; Oxygen; Shielding; Surface tension; Tensile strength; Welds; Effect of oxygen; Gas compositions; Gas metal arcs; High tensile strength steels; Hybrid welding process; Plasma keyhole; Plasma-GMA hybrid welding; Shielding gas; Weld bead; Welding conditions; Carbon dioxide","","","Open Access funding provided by Osaka University.

The CTSI combines quantification of pancreatic and extrapancreatic inflammation with the extent of pancreatic necrosis. Methods: Post-hoc retrospective analysis of a large, multicentric database (44 institutions) of SAP patients in Japan. The area under the curve (AUC) of the CTSI for predicting mortality and the odds ratio (OR) of the extent of pancreatic inflammation and necrosis were calculated using multivariable analysis. Results: In total, 1097 patients were included. The AUC of the CTSI for mortality was 0.65 (95 % confidence interval [CI:] [0.59–0.70]; p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, necrosis 30–50 % and >50 % in low-enhanced pancreatic parenchyma (LEPP) was independently associated with a significant increase in mortality, with OR 2.04 and 95 % CI 1.01–4.12 (P < 0.05) and OR 3.88 and 95 % CI 2.04–7.40 (P < 0.001), respectively. However, the extent of pancreatic inflammation was not associated with mortality, regardless of severity. Conclusions: The degree of necrosis in LEPP assessed using early CECT of SAP was a better predictor of mortality than the extent of pancreatic inflammation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrast-enhanced computed tomography; Low-enhanced pancreatic parenchyma; Pancreatic inflammation; Pancreatic necrosis; Severe acute pancreatitis","acute pancreatitis; adult; area under the curve; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; female; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; mortality rate; multicenter study; multidetector computed tomography; pancreas necrosis; parenchyma; retrospective study; treatment outcome; acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis; aged; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; inflammation; necrosis; pancreas; pancreatitis; pathology; prognosis; severity of illness index; x-ray computed tomography; contrast medium; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Contrast Media; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Necrosis; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Pancreatitis, Acute Necrotizing; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","Contrast Media","We would like to acknowledge for Kazuichi Okazaki, Tsuyoshi Takeda, Naoya Suzuki, Jun Kataoka, Tomohiro Adachi, Shin Namiki, Sakue Masuda, Tomoaki Hashida, Naoki Shinyama, Hitoshi Yamamura, Kazuo Inui, Kyoji Oe, Takashi Muraki, Tetsuya Ito, Yukiko Masuda, Natsuko Tokuhira, Junichi Sakagami, Hiroaki Yasuda, Yoshinori Azumi, Masayuki Kamochi, Keiji Nagata, Nobuyuki Saito, Mizuki Sato, Kyohei Miyamoto, Junko Izai, Kazunori Takeda, Motohiro Sekino, Tomoki Furuya, Yoshimoto Seki, Tetsuya Mine, Youhei Kawashima, Naoyuki Matsuda, Masato Inaba, Mineji Hayakawa, Takuyo Misumi and Yuki Takeda with the support of the data collection at 44 institutions (Osaka Saiseikai Senri Hospital, Hiroshima City Hiroshima Citizens Hospital, Kansai Medical University Hirakata Hospital, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Iizuka Hospital, Japanese Red Cross Musashino Hospital, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, Japanese Redcross Maebashi Hospital, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Showa University Hospital, Nihon University Hospital, Saiseikai Kumamoto Hospital, Fukuyama City Hospital, Jichi Medical University Hospital, Chiba University Hospital, Osaka Metroplitan University Hospital, Tohoku University Hospital, Nihon University Itabashi Hospital, Gifu University Hospital, Second Teaching Hospital, Fujita Health University, Asahi General Hospital, Shinshu University Hospital, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, University Hospital, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Mie University Hospital, Hospital of the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Chiba-Hokusoh Hospital, Jichi Medical University, Saitama Medical Center, Wakayama Medical University Hospital, Tokyo Metropolitan Bokutoh Hospital, Jikei University Hospital, Saka General Hospital, Natinal Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Nagasaki University Hospital, Keio University Hospital, Japanese Red Cross Akita Hospital, Ibaraki Prefectural Central Hospital, Tokai University Hospital, Nagoya University Hospital, Hokkaido University Hospital, National Cancer Center, Akita City Hospital, Kobe University Hospital, Tokyo Rosai Hospital).

This study aimed to elucidate the droplet detachment mechanism in MCAW using numerical simulations. It was observed that in the initial stage of droplet growth, the argon arc attachment (which carried a large portion of the current) was located on the metal sheath surrounding the unmelted flux. Moreover, an eddy containing an upward flow at the wire axis was formed inside the droplet. When this eddy was formed, the droplet volume increased owing to wire melting. However, neck formation did not occur. This is considered to be because only a small portion of the current is conducted through the droplet, and the Lorentz force acting on the droplet is significantly weak. Thereafter, when the droplet grew to a certain extent and the arc attachment moved below the unmelted flux position, the Lorentz force acted strongly and almost uniformly on the droplet. Accordingly, this eddy disappeared, and the flow abruptly transitioned to a downward unidirectional high-speed flow. Consequently, the droplet began to extend downward to form a neck, which caused it to detach. For these reasons, the time required for droplet detachment increased, and the metal transfer frequency decreased compared with the case of the solid wire. This explains the observation that globular transfer persists in metal-cored wires at currents higher than those for which the transition to spray transfer has occurred for solid wires. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Argon; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Lorentz force; Wire; 'current; Arc attachment; Arc-welding; Argon gas; Droplet detachment; Globular transfer; Metal cored wires; Solid wires; Spray transfer; Transfer modes; Drops","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University .; Funding text 2: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

The welding process was carried out at a welding current of 190, 220, 250, 280, and 310 A under an argon–CO<inf>2</inf> shielding gas mixture with six levels of CO<inf>2</inf> concentration of 0, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % for a parametric study. Unlike the conventional solid wire welding trend, where the droplet transfer frequency decreases with the increase in carbon dioxide concentration, an increase in metal transfer frequency was observed with the increase in CO<inf>2</inf> concentration from approximately 5 % to 20 %. The concentration reaching the maximum frequency was 20 % at 190 A, which decreased as the welding current increased, reaching 5 % at 310 A. Droplet initiation at the lower sheath end is succeeded by a gradual downward movement along the flux column's side after a few milliseconds. Upon reaching the lower end, the droplet forms a neck and undergoes separation. Thus, the length of the flux column directly impacts the duration of one droplet transfer cycle. The length was decreased by arc constriction when increasing CO<inf>2</inf> concentration appropriately to concentrate beneath the flux column or by increasing the welding current to raise the arc temperature, which contributed to melting and shortening the flux column. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arc plasma; Flux column; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfer; Metal vapor; Rutile flux-cored wire; Shielding gas","Argon; Carbon dioxide; Drops; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Laser beam welding; Oxide minerals; Shielding; Titanium alloys; Wire; Arc plasma; Arc-welding; CO 2 concentration; Droplet transfer; Flux column; Flux-cored arc welding; Metal transfers; Metal vapor; Rutile flux cored wires; Shielding gas; Titanium dioxide","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP21K04710 ), the Project on Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and an OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University.

New millisecond isomers have been identified at low excitation energies, 985.3(19) keV in Tl213 and 874(5) keV in Tl215. The measured half-lives of 1.34(5) ms in Tl213 and 3.0(3) ms in Tl215 suggest spins and parities 11/2- with the single proton-hole configuration πh11/2 as leading component. They are populated via E1 transitions by the decay of higher-lying isomeric states with proposed spin and parity 17/2+, interpreted as arising from a single πs1/2 proton hole coupled to the 8+ seniority isomer in the PbA+1 cores. The lowering of the 11/2- states is ascribed to an increase of the πh11/2 proton effective single-particle energy as the second νg9/2 orbital is filled by neutrons, owing to a significant reduction of the proton-neutron monopole interaction between the πh11/2 and νg9/2 orbitals. The new ms isomers provide the first experimental observation of shell evolution in the almost unexplored N>126 nuclear region below doubly magic Pb208. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Excitation energy; Hadrons; Isotherms; Radioactivity; Reactor shutdowns; Spin dynamics; Closed shells; Half lives; Hole configuration; Isomeric state; Low-excitation energy; Neutron-rich nuclei; Orbitals; Shell closures; Shell evolutions; Single-particle energy; Neutrons; proton; radioisotope; article; controlled study; evolution; human; isomer; magic; male; neutron; parity; spectroscopy","","proton, 12408-02-5, 12586-59-3","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the RI Beam Factory, operated by the RIKEN Nishina Center and CNS, University of Tokyo, for providing successful means to perform the experiment.

Five species occurring in this region can be distinguished by shape of their head, number of pectoral-fin rays, vertebral counts, arrangements of scales and cutaneous sensory papillae, and coloration. Two species are described as new, Rhinogobius rong sp. nov. and R. nami sp. nov., and the remaining three were identified as R. taenigena, R. leavelli, and R. similis. Though the morphology of R. leavelli and R. similis differed slightly between localities, counts and measurements overlapped, and coloration was variable. This study tentatively identifies all of those populations as R. leavelli or R. similis, but further research using additional specimens from a wider geographic range is required to clear the identity of the Rhinogobius occurring in this region. Rhinogobius rong, R. similis, and R. leavelli are distributed in both Da Nang City and Thua Thien Hue Province, with the first two species occurring widely in coastal areas, and R. leavelli restricted to inland areas.

We found that CIDWM in the Pt/GdFeCo wire exhibits nearly two times smaller in critical current density and about four times larger in DW mobility compared to the Rh/GdFeCo wire. By measuring the CIDWM under a longitudinal in-plane magnetic field, the DMI constant (D) was estimated for both wires. The estimated value of D for the Pt/GdFeCo wire is approximately seven times larger than the Rh/GdFeCo wire. It indicated that the Pt/GdFeCo wire revealed the CIDWM with much higher efficiency, mainly attributed to the much larger DMI, which may come from significantly stronger interfacial heavy metal/ferrimagnet hybridization in the Pt/GdFeCo wire. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Critical current density (superconductivity); Ferrimagnetism; Magnetic anisotropy; Platinum compounds; Rhodium; Rhodium compounds; Spin dynamics; 'current; Current-induced domain wall motions; Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction; Ferrimagnetics; Ferrimagnets; Higher efficiency; Hybridisation; In-plane magnetic fields; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Spin orbits; Wire","","","This research is funded by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, under Grant No. KHCBVL.02/22-23.

Using state-of-the-art epidemiological and climatological datasets, we examined the association between multiple heat stress indicators (HSIs) and daily human mortality in 739 cities worldwide. Notable differences were observed in the long-term trends and timing of heat events detected by HSIs. Air temperature (T<inf>air</inf>) predicts heat-related mortality well in cities with a robust negative T<inf>air</inf>-relative humidity correlation (C<inf>T-RH</inf>). However, in cities with near-zero or weak positive C<inf>T-RH</inf>, HSIs considering humidity provide enhanced predictive power compared to T<inf>air</inf>. Furthermore, the magnitude and timing of heat-related mortality measured by HSIs could differ largely from those associated with T<inf>air</inf> in many cities. Our findings provide important insights into specific regions where humans are vulnerable to humid heat and can facilitate the further enhancement of heat-health alert systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","climate change; heat stress; humidity; mortality; urban climate","","","","Q.G., M.H., and T.O. were supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF23S21120) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency provided by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan.

N. Suzuki, Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2022, 013D01 (2022)2050-391110.1093/ptep/ptab158; B. Pandey, Phys. Rev. C 105, L051001 (2022)2469-998510.1103/PhysRevC.105.L051001]. As part of this investigation, data were also collected using a gaseous hydrogen target, not only for a precise absolute mass scale calibration but also for the study of Λ/ς0 electroproduction. This dataset was acquired at Q2≃0.5 (GeV/c)2, W=2.14 GeV, and θγKc.m.≃8°. It covers forward angles where photoproduction data are scarce and a low-Q2 region that is of interest for hypernuclear experiments. On the other hand, this kinematic region is at a slightly higher Q2 than previous hypernuclear experiments, thus providing crucial information for understanding the Q2 dependence of the differential cross sections for Λ/ς0 hyperon electroproduction. This paper reports on the Q2 dependence of the differential cross section for the e+p→e′+K++Λ/ς0 reaction at 0.2-0.8 (GeV/c)2, and provides comparisons with the currently available theoretical models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Funding text 1: We thank the JLab staff of the Division of Physics, Division of Accelerator, and the Division of Engineering for providing support for conducting the experiment.

Chemical priming is a promising strategy to enhance tolerance to abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the use of 1-butanol as an effectual strategy to enhance drought stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. We first demonstrated that, among isopropanol, methanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol, pretreatment with 1-butanol was the most effective for enhancing drought tolerance. We tested the plants with a range of 1-butanol concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM) and further determined that 20 mM was the optimal concentration of 1-butanol that enhanced drought tolerance without compromising plant growth. Physiological tests showed that the enhancement of drought tolerance by 1-butanol pretreatment was associated with its stimulation of stomatal closure and improvement of leaf water retention. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between water- and 1-butanol-pretreated plants. The DEGs included genes involved in oxidative stress response processes. The DEGs identified here partially overlapped with those of ethanol-treated plants. Taken together, the results show that 1-butanol is a novel chemical priming agent that effectively enhances drought stress tolerance in Arabidopsis plants, and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-mediated abiotic stress tolerance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1-Butanol; Arabidopsis thaliana; Chemical priming; Drought stress tolerance; Stomatal closure; Transcriptome","butanol; water; Arabidopsis; drought; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; 1-Butanol; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Leaves; Stress, Physiological; Water","","butanol, 35296-72-1, 71-36-3; water, 7732-18-5; 1-Butanol; Water","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from RIKEN, Japan (to MS), including the RIKEN\u2013AIST Joint Research Fund (full research), Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (JPMJCR13B4 to MS), and A-STEP (JPMJTM19BS to MS) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan (Innovative Areas 18H04791 and 18H04705 to MS).; Funding text 2: We thank Chieko Torii, Kayoko Mizunashi, Kyoko Y.

These neurons coexpress several neurotransmitters and act as glutamatergic neurons. The contribution of glutamate from MCH neurons to memory- and metabolism-related functions has not been fully investigated. In a mouse model, we conditionally knocked out Slc17a6 gene, which encodes for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2), in the MCH neurons exclusively by using two different methods: the Cre recombinase/loxP system and in vivo genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9. Then, we evaluated several aspects of memory and measured metabolic rates using indirect calorimetry. We found that mice with MCH neuron-exclusive vGlut2 ablation had higher discrimination ratios between novel and familiar stimuli for novel object recognition, object location, and three-chamber tests. In contrast, there was no significant change in body weight, food intake, oxygen consumption, respiratory quotient, or locomotor activity. These findings suggest that glutamatergic signaling from MCH neurons is required to regulate memory, but its role in regulating metabolic rate is negligible. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","glutamate; melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH); memory; metabolic regulation; vglut2","","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (IS23078) and the Chinese Institute for Brain Science, Beijing (CIBR) internal funding to A.Y.

Abstract: The cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is an economically important vegetable crop cultivated and consumed worldwide. Despite its popularity, the manner in which cucumbers were dispersed from their origin in South Asia to the rest of the world, particularly to the east, remains a mystery due to the lack of written records. In this study, we performed genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) on 723 worldwide cucumber accessions, mainly deposited in the Japanese National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO) Genebank, to characterize their genetic diversity, relationships, and population structure. Analyses based on over 60,000 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by GBS revealed clear genetic differentiation between Southeast and East Asian populations, suggesting that they reached their respective region independently, not progressively. A deeper investigation of the East Asian population identified two subpopulations with different fruit characteristics, supporting the traditional classification of East Asian cucumbers into two types thought to have been introduced by independent routes. Finally, we developed a core collection of 100 accessions representing at least 93.2% of the genetic diversity present in the entire collection. The genetic relationships and population structure, their associations with geographic distribution and phenotypic traits, and the core collection presented in this study are valuable resources for elucidating the dispersal history and promoting the efficient use and management of genetic resources for research and breeding in cucumber. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Agriculture; Geographical distribution; Food research; Genetic characterization; Genetic population; Genetic relationships; Genetic resources; Genetics diversities; Genotyping; Key message; Population structures; Research organization; Biodiversity; cucumber; Far East; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asia, Eastern; Cucumis sativus; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","","","Funding text 1: We thank Prof. Dr. Koichiro Ushijima (Okayama University, Japan) for his helpful advice on GBS library preparation.; Funding text 2: Open Access funding provided by Okayama University.

Pseudocladophora conchopheria is a green alga that grows on the shells of intertidal gastropods distributed in the Japanese Archipelago, the Ryukyu Archipelago, and the southern part of Korean Peninsula. However, we discovered algae similar to P. conchopheria on the shells of gastropods from Vietnam. Therefore, species identification of the algae and the host gastropods was performed based on morphological observations and molecular genetic methods. As a result, the morphological characteristics of the algae were consistent with those of P. conchopheria, and the morphological characteristics of the host gastropods were consistent with those of Lunella granulata. Molecular genetic methods further supported these results of morphological identification. Interestingly, their algae were more closely related to P. conchopheria attached to L. correensis from the Sea of Japan rather than those attached to L. granulata from the Ryukyu Archipelago. These results suggest that P. conchopheria has expanded its distribution by utilizing multiple hosts and are explained on a wider scale than previous findings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geographical structure; Green alga; Intertidal gastropod; Symbiont; Wide area distribution","epibiosis; geographical distribution; green alga; host-symbiont interaction; identification key; intertidal environment; morphology; new record; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Korea; Osaka [Kinki]; Pacific Ocean; Sakai; Sea of Japan; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: We thank Shun Ito, Takahiro Hirano, Takumi Saito, and Masanori Tatani for the research advice and support.

The color and appearance of the fruit draw people's attention and let them know that it is fresh. Strawberry's bright red color comes from a chemical called anthocyanin. People are drawn to products that are bright red because they look fresh. Meanwhile during storage, strawberries lose their form and color, and their biochemical qualities, such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenols, and antioxidants, change as well. These natural substances in strawberries are important for keeping people healthy and meeting their food needs. This study looked at how the natural composition of strawberries changed after they were treated with edible coatings. The edible coating used in this study consisted of three main components: a combination of jicama starch (JS), agarwood bouya essential oil (AE), and calcium propionate (CA). The final results were analyzed using the TOPSIS Shannon Entropy method to determine the best treatment. TOPSIS defined as a multi-criterion decision-making analytic method. From the TOPSIS results JS-AE edible coating ranked highest at 0.717, demonstrating excellent color density (7.62), polymeric color (0.170), percent polymeric color (16.98), total flavonoid content (3.99 g kg−1), and antioxidant activity (56.74% Radical scavenging activity) of strawberry during 16 days of storage at 4 °C compared to the control samples. Further development of this research needs to be done, particularly in the area of sensory analysis, to find out whether consumers would prefer these new coatings as a way to maintain the quality of fresh fruit. In particular, there should be more types of fruit and vegetable applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Color stability; Edible coating; Storage; Strawberry","Anthocyanins; Antioxidants; Behavioral research; Cold storage; Color; Decision making; Essential oils; Food storage; Fruits; Quality control; Sensory analysis; Agarwood; Biochemical quality; Biochemical stability; Color stability; Edible coating; Flavonoid; Know-that; Polymeric colours; Quality factors; Strawberry; Starch","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the JSPS KAKENHI [Project no.

Foehn winds originating from the Truong Son Mountains (also known as Laos winds) are believed to contribute to abnormally high temperatures; however, no quantitative research has focused on foehn warming in Vietnam. In this study, we conducted numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to investigate the contribution of foehn warming to abnormally high temperatures in north-central Vietnam in early June 2017. Generally, May–June is the monsoon period in Vietnam. Consequently, foehn warming during this season is thought to be mainly caused by latent heating and precipitation mechanism. However, the primary factor in the cases covered in this study was foehn warming with an isentropic drawdown mechanism. Diabatic heating with turbulent diffusion and sensible heat flux from mountain slopes also plays significant roles. The warming effect of the foehn winds on the temperatures during the events was approximately 28–38C. It was concluded that the high temperature events from 31 May to 5 June 2017 were caused by synoptic-scale warm advection and foehn warming. Sensitivity experiments were conducted on the WRF Model, utilizing three atmospheric boundary layer turbulence schemes (YSU, ACM2, and MYNN), consistently yielding results for simulated temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed bias for the MYNN scheme was found to be lower than that of the other schemes. However, this study did not delve into the underlying reasons for these differences. The optimal performance of each scheme remains an open question. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: It was hypothesized that north-central Vietnam often experiences high temperatures owing to foehn winds (also known as Laos winds) descending from the Truong Son Mountains. This study conducted numerical experiments to validate this hypothesis and investigate the associated mechanisms of foehn winds in this region. Surprisingly, despite the monsoon season, the isentropic drawdown mechanism without precipitation effects provides the primary explanation for the high temperatures caused by foehn winds in north-central Vietnam, and not the latent heating and precipitation mechanism with precipitation effects that researchers expected. The results of this study contribute to better prediction of high temperatures in this region and improve our understanding of foehn winds in tropical monsoon climate zones. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asia; Boundary layer; Downslope winds; Mountain meteorology","Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric turbulence; Boundary layer flow; Latent heat; Precipitation (meteorology); Temperature; Weather forecasting; Wind; Wind forecasting; Asia; Central Vietnam; Downslope winds; Foehn winds; Heating mechanisms; Highest temperature; Mountain meteorologies; Precipitation mechanism; Viet Nam; Weather research and forecasting models; Atmospheric thermodynamics; boundary layer; computer simulation; foehn; high temperature; mountain environment; numerical model; orographic effect; quantitative analysis; weather forecasting; Truong Son","","","Funding text 1: This study was conducted by an international corporation at the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Tsukuba and the University of Science and Technology of Hanoi.

The experiments were arranged and carried out continuously from 2020 to 2023, the first two years at Kyushu University in Japan and the last year at Duy Tan University in Vietnam. During the time in Japan, the effects of salinity stress on the reproductive growth stages and the morphological characteristics of M. crystallinum cultured in the soil treated with saline solutions containing 0 mM, 100 mM, and 400 mM NaCl were determined. Then, the seeds harvested from these plants were reproduced to develop them as the high salt-tolerance plants in Vietnam. The results show that 400 mM NaCl-treated plants maintained their growth and developed well during the vegetative growth stage. These plants had shorter flower blooming times than the 100 mM NaCl-treated and control ones (0 mM NaCl). The seeds harvested from NaCl-treated and control plants in Japan had regenerated in vitro plants well in the Vietnamese culture rooms. Interestingly, the 400 mM NaCl-treated M. crystallinum grew healthily in the soil, and their leaves, flowers, and seedpods tended to accumulate more betacyanin and epidermal bladder cells (EBCs) than other plants. These characteristics may be desirable for rehabilitating saline soil and developing high-salinity tolerance M. crystallinum for cultivation and growth in Vietnam. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Betacyanin; Epidermal bladder cells; Flower; NaCl-treated samples; Seed","angiosperm; cell; flower; growth; halophyte; pigment; saline soil; salinity tolerance; seed; sodium chloride; Japan; Kyushu; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported by the FY 2021 JSPS Invitational fellowships for research in Japan (Long term) program in Kyushu University (Fellowship ID: 21519).","Adams, Patricia H., Growth and development of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (Aizoaceae), New Phytologist, 138, 2, pp. 171-190, (1998); Agarie, Sakae, Salt tolerance, salt accumulation, and ionic homeostasis in an epidermal bladder-cell-less mutant of the common ice plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Journal of Experimental Botany, 58, 8, pp. 1957-1967, (2007); Agarie, Sakae, Potential of the common ice plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum as a new high-functional food as evaluated by polyol accumulation, Plant Production Science, 12, 1, pp. 37-46, (2009); Barkla, Bronwyn J., Single-cell-type quantitative proteomic and ionomic analysis of epidermal bladder cells from the halophyte model plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum to identify salt-responsive proteins, BMC Plant Biology, 16, 1, (2016); Bohnert, Hans Jürgen, The ice plant cometh: Lessons in abiotic stress tolerance, Journal of Plant Growth Regulation, 19, 3, pp. 334-346, (2000); Cushman, John C., Large-scale mRNA expression profiling in the common ice plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, performing C3 photosynthesis and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), Journal of Experimental Botany, 59, 7, pp. 1875-1894, (2008); Cushman, John C., Crassulacean acid metabolism.

The Hau Giang medaka, Oryzias haugiangensis, was originally described from the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam, and later reported also from southeastern Thailand, west of the Mekong Delta region. However, the species' full geographic range and population genetic structures remain unknown. Field surveys showed a widespread distribution of this species along the east coast of the Indochinese Peninsula, as far as northern Vietnam. A mitochondrial gene phylogeny and population genetic structure analysis using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that the populations of O. haugiangensis are highly structuralized along the east coast of Vietnam, with the southernmost Mekong Delta population clearly separated from three populations north of central Vietnam.

Consequently, the male and female from the same species might be erroneously assigned to different species or even different genera, which could generate synonymies in classification if only morphological data were used. Phintella is a species-rich genus of Salticidae, which currently exhibits 76 named species. However, the male–female counterpart is unknown for nearly half of the species. In this study, we used a molecular approach to delineate the species boundaries for Phintella and Phintella-like specimens collected in Vietnam, using morphological information as supporting data. We used three gene fragments (mitochondrial COI, 16S-ND1, and nuclear 28S) and biogeographical considerations for species delimitation. A total of 22 putative species were recognized: 18 species of the genus Phintella, one species of the genus Lechia (L. squamata), and three species of the genus Phinteloides. Eleven undescribed species were discovered, of which seven have a male–female combination, two species have only males, and two species have only females. The crown age of Phintella was estimated at the Serravallian stage of the Miocene after the increase of species number around 16 MYA. The crown ages of most putative species recognized in this study were estimated in the Pleistocene, and the divergence among sister species likely occurred from the mid-Miocene to the Pliocene. Our ancestral range reconstruction results showed that the diversification of our ingroup was governed by progressive dispersal events, i.e., Phintella and their related species in Vietnam diversified while expanding their range on the continent. Our results provide fundamental biodiversity data for a high-diversity genus in Vietnamese Phintella spiders. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","jumping spider; molecular phylogeny; RASP; sexual dimorphism; species boundaries; synonyms","","","","Funding text 1: We thank Prof. Nguyen Van Sinh and Dr. Nguyen Duc Anh (IEBR), the director and staff of Ba Vi National Park (Hanoi), Ben En National Park (Thanh Hoa), Chu Yang Sin National Park (Dak Lak), Lo Go Xa Mat National Park (Tay Ninh), Phu Quoc National Park (Kien Giang), Pu Mat National Park (Nghe An), Vu Quang National Park (Ha Tinh), Xuan Son National Park (Phu Tho), Yok Don National Park (Dak Lak), Dak Rong Nature Reserve (Quang Tri), Na Hang Nature Reserve (Tuyen Quang), Xuan Lien Nature Reserve (Thanh Hoa), Tam Dao National Park (Vinh Phuc) and Me Linh Biodiversity station (Vinh Phuc) for their help during field works.

Marine resources are important for the development of Vietnam. In Vietnamese seas, there are about 20 typical ecosystems spreading over 1 million square kilometers in the East Sea consisting of mangrove forests, coral reefs, lagoons, seagrasses in intertidal areas and estuaries, and living species in 155,000 hectares, 1,300 square kilometers, 500 square kilometers, 16,000 hectares, and 11,000 living species, respectively. At present, the impact of climate change, socio-economic development, and environmental pollution are considered as the main causes of degradation of Vietnam’s marine ecosystems. This paper presents and discusses the pressure of socio-economic activities including industry, tourism, marine transportation and services, aquaculture and fishery on marine ecosystems. In Vietnam, compared to the early 2000s a total of 12% of coral reefs, and 48% of other coral reefs are vulnerable to degradation. So far, about 100 species of marine life in Vietnam are at risk of being threatened due to over-exploitation and fishing. The seagrass-bed ecosystem is currently being degraded with only over 5,580 ha remaining. In some areas, such as Cat Ba, Ha Long, and Quang Nam, seagrass beds have almost no chance to recover naturally due to serious impacts from tourism and aquaculture activities. From the findings, orientations that aim at effective management and protection of marine ecosystems to cope with adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities, climate change, and the pressure of socioeconomic development were proposed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","climate change; environmental protection; marine ecosystem; pressure; socioeconomic development","climate change; coastal zone; coral reef; ecosystem management; environmental degradation; environmental protection; human activity; marine ecosystem; seagrass; Viet Nam","","","The authors express their gratitude to the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) and the Tokyo Institute of Technology for their support through the project ‘Collaborative Research Platform to Manage Risk and Enhance Resilience of Coral Reef in Southeast Asia CRRP2018-FP12-Khanal’.

As such, assessing different regions’ preexisting immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is important to understand the transmission potential of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Design: In 975 serum samples from Vietnam (2014 to 2019), anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was performed using Wuhan strain and variants of concern (VOCs). Cross-reactivity was confirmed by analyzing B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequences and identifying BCR repertoire sequences-derived T-cell epitopes. Results: Overall, 20.9% (n = 76/364) and 9.2% (n = 7) demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity (PRNT<inf>50</inf>) against the Wuhan and Alpha strain, respectively. Neutralizing activity against Beta, Gamma, and Delta strains was absent (PRNT<inf>50</inf><5) in all samples. Cross-reactive epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus spike proteins were detected in the N-terminal domain, S2, and receptor-binding domain regions. Conclusions: Following BCR and major histocompatibility complex analysis, T-cell receptor-recognized epitope motif (TREM) among pathogenic coronaviruses and coronaviruses spike proteins were the top TREM peptide, suggesting that pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vietnam was due to exposure to common cold coronaviruses. With limited immunity against emerging VOCs, further monitoring, and control of the epidemic, along with COVID-19 vaccine programs against VOCs, are necessary. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellular immunity; COVID-19; Pre-existing antibodies; Variants of concern; Vietnam","B lymphocyte receptor; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; immunoglobulin G; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; adolescent; adult; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; cellular immunity; child; cohort analysis; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; dilution; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; high throughput sequencing; human; humoral immunity; immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonhuman; pandemic; peptide microarray; plaque reduction neutralization test; seroprevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T lymphocyte; variant of concern; genetics; season; Viet Nam; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Epitopes; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Seasons; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vietnam","","immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9, 308067-58-5; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19 Vaccines; Epitopes; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2","Funding text 1: TTNN is grateful for academic support from the Program for Nurturing Global Leaders in Tropical and Emerging Communicable Diseases of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University.

The polyol-derived MgAlFeZn-OH are nanosheets with homogeneous elemental distribution, while the hydrothermal-derived MgAlFeZn-OH are mixtures of plate-like hydroxide layers and rod-like spinel oxides. The coordinating properties and the high viscosity of the ethylene glycol provide the possibility to mediate the hydrolysis rates and to control the particle growth. The high specific surface area of the polyol-derived multi-element hydroxide nanosheets (352.4 m2 g−1) guarantees them as excellent adsorbents for adsorbing anionic dyes in aqueous solution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Aluminum compounds; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Iron compounds; Magnesium compounds; Nanosheets; Organic solvents; Bottom-up synthesis; Common solvents; Comparatives studies; Elemental distribution; Fe cations; Hydroxide layers; Multielements; Role of solvents; Spinel oxide; Zn cations; Polyols","","","Funding text 1: This research work was financially supported by OU Master Plan Implementation Project promoted under Osaka University, a Grant-in-Aid for the Cooperative Research Project of Design & Engineering by Joint Inverse Innovation for Materials Architecture (DEJI2MA) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21H01637, Japan.

The number of vascular bundles in the panicle neck (VBN) is correlated with the diameter of the panicle neck (DPN), but there are few reported QTLs for DPN. We conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between ‘Asominori’ and ‘IR24’ and detected three QTLs—qDPN5, qDPN6, and qDPN11—on chromosomes 5, 6, and 11. The qDPN5, qDPN6, and qDPN11 were in the same position as the QTLs for VBN reported in previous studies. Within the RILs, there was a significant positive correlation between DPN and VBN. In segregating populations, each QTL had a distinct effect on both values. Analysis of chromosome segment substitution lines showed that qDPN5 and qDPN11 affected DPN and qDPN6 affected VBN. Through substitution mapping, we narrowed down the region of qDPN5 and qVBN5.2 to 960 kbp between KNJ8 Indel385 and RM18926, and the region of qVBN6 to 750 kbp between C5 Indel5756 and KNJ8 Indel493. Due to the weak effect of qDPN6 in the ‘IR24’ genetic background, the location of qDPN6 could not be determined. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CSSL; panicle neck diameter; pyramided line","","","","Funding text 1: IAS, and AIS were provided by the rice seed stock center of Kyushu University with the partial support of the National Bio-Resource Project of the MXT , Japan.

This study investigates a dynamic resource management problem in a large-scale UAV-aided wireless network, where multiple UAVs operate as aerial base stations to serve ground users. To enhance communication efficiency for all users in the presence of co-channel interference, we propose the use of an Ising model-based optimization method for fast and accurate UAV-user association and resource allocation. First, we formulate the dynamic user association and resource allocation problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. Subsequently, we transform the objective function in the formulated problem into the energy function of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and applied coherent ising machine (CIM), which has been proven to be robust for solving dense Ising problems. We evaluate our proposed method through simulations and the real CIM for optimization. Additionally, we compared our method with simulated annealing, steepest descent, and exhaustive search. Performance evaluation results indicate that our proposed method is superior in terms of computational time and data rate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","D-Wave; Ising machine; multi-UAV; optimization methods; quantum annealing; resource allocation; Wireless networks","Aircraft communication; Antenna grounds; Cash registers; Compound engines; Health risks; Ising model; Linear programming; Mobile antennas; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quantum communication; Resource allocation; Steepest descent method; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Common information model (electricity); D-wave; Dynamic scheduling; Information Modeling; Ising machine; Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle; Optimisations; Optimization method; Quantum annealing; Resource management; Resources allocation; Simulated annealing","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Science and Technology Agency Moonshot Research and Development Program (JST Moonshot RD) under Grant JPMJMS2021 and Grant JPMJMS2216, in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (JSPS KAKENHI) under Grant JP20H05921, Grant JP22K14263, Grant JP23K22763, and Grant JP22H05197; in part by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) under Grant JP23dm0307009; in part by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center, Institute of AI and Beyond, The University of Tokyo (UTokyo); in part by the 2023 Brain Korea 21 Program for Leading Universities and Students (BK21 FOUR) Program of Pusan National University; and in part by the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), the 3rd period of SIP Smart energy management system Grant Number JPJ012207.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by JST Moonshot RD Grant Number JPMJMS2021, AMED under Grant Number JP23dm0307009, AI Center of UTokyo, Institute of AI and Beyond of UTokyo, JSPS Kakenhi Grant Numbers JP20H05921, JP22K14263, JP23K22763, and JP22H05197.","Ullah, Zaib, Cognition in UAV-Aided 5G and beyond Communications: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 6, 3, pp. 872-891, (2020); Liu, Ying, Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Latency Minimization for Mobile Edge Computing With Virtualization in Maritime UAV Communication Network, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 71, 4, pp. 4225-4236, (2022); Ullah, Arif, Aerial-Terrestrial Networks With Multi-Antenna Transmissions: How Many UAVs Need to Be Deployed?, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 73, 2, pp. 2212-2226, (2024); Oubbati, Omar Sami, Softwarization of UAV networks: A survey of applications and future trends, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 98073-98125, (2020); Mozaffari, Mohammad, A Tutorial on UAVs for Wireless Networks: Applications, Challenges, and Open Problems, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 3, pp. 2334-2360, (2019); Do, Vinh Quang, Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning in UAV-Enabled Wireless Powered Networks, IEEE Communications Letters, 26, 1, pp. 99-103, (2022); Zeng, Yong, Throughput Maximization for UAV-Enabled Mobile Relaying Systems, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 64, 12, pp. 4983-4996, (2016); Zhang, Shuhang, Cellular UAV-To-X Communications: Design and Optimization for Multi-UAV Networks, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 18, 2, pp. 1346-1359, (2019); Yang, Peng, Three-dimensional drone-cell deployment for congestion mitigation in cellular networks, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 67, 10, pp. 9867-9881, (2018); Shang, Bodong, Spectrum Sharing for UAV Communications: Spatial Spectrum Sensing and Open Issues, IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine, 15, 2, pp. 104-112, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202740252"

The testing process was conducted as a method to collect input parameters and validate the results of the computing simulation. The simulation procedure used the step running technique to evaluate two different water-path models. The findings indicated that the maximum temperature of the stator winding and jacket cover decreased by 19.12 °C and 16.07 °C, respectively, following the installation of the water jacket and operation at a low flow rate with a current supply of 200 A. Furthermore, increasing the water flow rate leads to a substantial decrease in maximum temperature before a certain flow rate; 2 liters per minute (LPM) was chosen as the optimal rate. Temperature fluctuations exhibit an upward trend up to 1.85 °C with the higher supplied currents but drop with a higher flow rate. In addition, the motor maximum temperature in the long water-path jacket (LWJ) model was lower than in the short water-path jacket (SWJ) model due to the higher heat transfer coefficient (HTC). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electric motorcycle; Synchronous reluctance motor; Time-Dependent temperature; Water-Cooling jacket","","","","This work was supported from Thailand Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, National Energy Technology Center, and National Electronics and Computer Technology Center.

To ensure the safety of aquatic wildlife, it is essential to determine the toxicity of these antibiotics and establish appropriate concentration limits. Additionally, in (eco)toxicological studies, addressing the issue of multiple hypothesis testing through p-value adjustments is crucial for robust decision-making. In this study, we assessed the no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of CFX and OFX on Moina macrocopa across a concentration range of 0–400 µg L−1. Furthermore, we investigated multiple p-value adjustments to determine the NOAECs. Our analysis yielded consistent results across seven different p-value adjustments, indicating NOAECs of 100 µg CFX L−1 for age at first reproduction and 200 µg CFX L−1 for fertility. For OFX treatment, a NOAEC of 400 µg L−1 was observed for both biomarkers. However, further investigation is required to establish the NOAEC of OFX at higher concentrations with greater certainty. Our findings demonstrate that CFX exhibits higher toxicity compared to OFX, consistent with previous research. Moreover, this study highlights the differential performance of p-value adjustment methods in terms of maintaining statistical power while controlling the multiplicity problem, and their practical applicability. The study emphasizes the low NOAECs for these antibiotics in the zooplanktonic group, highlighting their significant risks to ecological and environmental safety. Additionally, our investigation of p-value adjustment approaches contributes to a deeper understanding of their performance characteristics, enabling (eco)toxicologists to select appropriate methods based on their specific needs and priorities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","antibiotic pollution; Fluoroquinolones; multiple comparisons problem; NOAEC; non-target organism","ciprofloxacin; ofloxacin; antiinfective agent; antibiotic therapy; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; environmental risk; explanatory variable; fertility; mathematical model; Moina macrocopa; no-observed-adverse-effect concentration; nonhuman; reproduction; response variable; statistical model; statistical significance; toxicity testing; type I error; zooplankton; animal; Cladocera; dose response; drug effect; female; no-observed-adverse-effect level; toxicity; water pollutant; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Fertility; No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level; Ofloxacin; Reproduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1, 86393-32-0, 128074-72-6, 128074-76-0, 192934-52-4, 93107-08-5, 86483-48-9, 96186-80-0; ofloxacin, 82419-36-1; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Ofloxacin; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number: 20K20640), Japan, and Nagasaki University WISE Programme Research, Japan.

Infected patients could progress to severe plasma leakage and hemorrhagic shock, where current standard treatment remains supportive. Previous reports suggested that several flavonoid derivatives inhibited mosquito-borne flaviviruses. This work aimed to explore sulfonamide chalcone derivatives as dengue inhibitors and to identify molecular targets. We initially screened 27 sulfonamide chalcones using cell-based antiviral and cytotoxic screenings. Two potential compounds, SC22 and SC27, were identified with DENV1-4 EC<inf>50</inf>s in the range of 0.71–0.94 and 3.15–4.46 μM, and CC<inf>50</inf>s at 14.63 and 31.02 μM, respectively. The compounds did not show any elevation in ALT or Cr in C57BL/6 mice on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days after being administered intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg SC22 or SC27 in a single dose. Moreover, the SAM-binding site of NS5 methyltransferase was a potential target of SC27 identified by computational and enzyme-based assays. The main target of SC22 was in a late stage of viral replication, but the exact target molecule had yet to be identified. In summary, a sulfonamide chalcone, SC27, was a potential DENV inhibitor that targeted viral methyltransferase. Further investigation should be the study of the structure-activity relationship of SC27 derivatives for higher potency and lower toxicity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chalcone; Dengue; Flavonoid; Methyltransferase; Sulfonamide","ademetionine; alanine aminotransferase; antivirus agent; chalcone derivative; creatinine; methyltransferase; sulfonamide; virus enzyme; chalcone; viral nonstructural protein; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; antiviral activity; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; computer model; controlled study; creatinine blood level; Dengue virus; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; Dengue virus 3; Dengue virus 4; drug binding site; drug cytotoxicity; drug screening; EC50; enzyme assay; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; single drug dose; virus replication; animal; binding site; C57BL mouse; chemistry; dengue; human; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Binding Sites; Chalcone; Chalcones; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Humans; Methyltransferases; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Sulfonamides; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Virus Replication","","ademetionine, 29908-03-0, 485-80-3; alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4; chalcone, 94-41-7; Antiviral Agents; Chalcone; Chalcones; Methyltransferases; Sulfonamides; Viral Nonstructural Proteins","This research project is supported by Ratchadapiseksompotch Research fund, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University ( RA-MF-12/65 , RA 25/66 ).

This study describes the types of livelihood adaptations (LAs) that coastal fishers in QN have practiced in response to EWEs and find the varieties in these adaptation strategy choices. In this study, we investigated livelihood adaptation strategies in coastal areas through a household survey and analysis of the collected data using MS Excel. Two sample strategies were used, stratified and random sampling, to select 229 coastal fishers from 11 communes; and data are collected through designed questionnaires. The current study employed statistical disaggregation and comparative methods to analyze coastal fishers’ adaptation strategy choices in QN Province. A range of adaptation strategies were identified consisting of five reactive LAs and eight anticipatory LAs practiced differently by coastal fishers. Among the eight anticipatory LAs, discontinuing production for a certain time is a novel adaptation in QN Province. In addition, a divergence in conducting LAs by production forms was found. On-sand farming and offshore fishers invest in advanced technologies and facilities as adaptive measures. By contrast, fishers who farm in estuaries, lagoons, and nearshore fishing fishers are more likely to change and diversify their jobs. The study’s key findings about livelihood adaptation measures and their differences are significant for improving coastal fisher’s livelihoods in Vietnam. Any efforts at local and national levels in developing mitigation strategies for the impact of EWEs may consider the coastal fisher’s adaptation choices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through the Project for Human Resources Development Scholarship by the Japanese Grant Aid (JDS).

Here, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy based on synthetic lethality combining trifluridine/tipiracil and MK1775 (WEE1 inhibitor) as a treatment for ESCC. This study demonstrates that trifluridine induces single-strand DNA damage in ESCC cells, as evidenced by phosphorylated replication protein 32. The DNA damage response includes cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) (Tyr15) phosphorylation as CDK1 inhibition and a decrease of the proportion of phospho-histone H3 (p-hH3)-positive cells, indicating cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase before mitosis entry. The WEE1 inhibitor remarkedly suppressed CDK1 phosphorylation (Try15) and reactivated CDK1, and also increased the proportion of p-hH3-positive cells, which indicates an increase of the number of cells into mitosis. Trifluridine combined with a WEE1 inhibitor increased trifluridine-mediated DNA damage, namely DNA double-strand breaks, as shown by increased γ-H2AX expression. Moreover, the combination treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil and a WEE1 inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor growth of ESCC-derived xenograft models. Hence, our novel combination treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil and a WEE1 inhibitor is considered a candidate treatment strategy for ESCC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DNA damage response; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; synthetic lethality; trifluridine; WEE1 inhibitor","adavosertib; cyclin dependent kinase 1; histone H2AX; histone H3; single stranded DNA; tipiracil plus trifluridine; cell cycle protein; histone; protein tyrosine kinase; tipiracil; trifluridine; WEE1 protein, human; adult; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle G2 phase; cell viability; chemoradiotherapy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; DNA damage response; DNA repair; double stranded DNA break; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; IC50; immunoblotting; lethality; male; middle aged; mitosis; mouse; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; tumor growth; tumor volume; esophagus tumor; phosphorylation; tumor cell line; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Histones; Humans; Phosphorylation; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Trifluridine","","adavosertib, 955365-80-7, 1277170-60-1; tipiracil plus trifluridine, 733030-01-8; histone, 9062-68-4; protein tyrosine kinase, 80449-02-1; tipiracil, 183204-74-2, 183204-72-0; trifluridine, 70-00-8; Cell Cycle Proteins; Histones; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; tipiracil; Trifluridine; WEE1 protein, human","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the Medical Research Support Center, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University for flow cytometry, supported by the Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

Many studies in high-income countries have focused on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, evidence of awareness of SLE and HRQoL in low- and middle-income countries is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the determinants of HRQoL of SLE patients in Vietnam, a lower-middle income country. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Hospital of Dermatology and Venereology in 2019. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. It consisted of Short Form-36 to assess HRQoL which comprised physical and mental component summaries, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Mental Adjustment to SLE. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the determinants of HRQoL. Results: One hundred thirty four patients with SLE participated in this study. The majority of the patients were women (n = 126, 94.0%). The mean age of all participants was 37.9 years old (standard deviation [SD] 12.5). Of 134 participants, 104 (77.6%) were married. Older patients were more likely to have a lower score of mental component summary (B=-0.45, 95% CI -0.73, -0.17). Patients with more children were more likely to have a lower score of physical component summary (B=-5.14, 95% CI -9.27, -1.00). Patients who felt more helplessness or hopelessness were more likely to have lower scores of physical and mental component summaries (B=-1.85, 95% CI -2.80, -0.90; B=-1.69, 95% CI -2.57, -0.81). Also, patients who felt more anxious were more likely to have a lower score of mental component summary (B=-1.04, 95% CI -1.77, -0.32). Patients who were more satisfied with their lives were more likely to have higher scores of physical and mental component summaries (B = 1.07, 95% CI 0.50, 1.64; B = 1.08, 95% CI 0.55, 1.61). Conclusion: Factors associated with lower HRQoL in Vietnam were feelings of helplessness or hopelessness, and burdens of parenting roles. However, social support can contribute to a higher HRQoL, such as information support, self-support groups, and daycare services provided at the community level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","HRQoL; Lower middle-income country; SLE; Vietnam","adult; Article; coping behavior assesment; cross-sectional study; female; helplessness; hopelessness; human; life satisfaction; major clinical study; male; mental adjustment to SLE; Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support; quality of life; Satisfaction with Life Scale; Short Form 36; social support; structured questionnaire; systemic lupus erythematosus; Viet Nam; young adult","","","Funding text 1: We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the patients with SLE who participated in this study and the National Hospital of Dermatology and Venereology in Hanoi, Vietnam.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying heterosis remains unclear. This study took advantage of Arabidopsis intraspecific hybrids to identify heterosis-related metabolites. Forty-six intraspecific hybrids were used to examine parental effects on seed area and germination time. The degree of heterosis was evaluated based on biomass: combinations showing high heterosis of F<inf>1</inf> hybrids exhibited a biomass increase from 6.1 to 44% over the better parent value (BPV), whereas that of the low- and no-heterosis hybrids ranged from − 19.8 to 9.8% over the BPV. Metabolomics analyses of F<inf>1</inf> hybrids with high heterosis and those with low one suggested that changes in TCA cycle intermediates are key factors that control growth. Notably, higher fumarate/malate ratios were observed in the high heterosis F<inf>1</inf> hybrids, suggesting they provide metabolic support associated with the increased biomass. These hybrids may produce more energy-intensive biomass by speeding up the efficiency of TCA fluxes. However, the expression levels of TCA-process-related genes in F<inf>1</inf> hybrids were not associated with the intensity of heterosis, suggesting that the post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation of these genes may affect the productivity of the intermediates in the TCA cycle. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","agriculture; Arabidopsis; biomass; citric acid cycle; metabolomics; Agriculture; Biomass; Citric Acid Cycle; Metabolomics","","","Funding text 1: We thank Prof. Kazuki Saito (RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science) for helpful discussions regarding the experiments.

As part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks large program, we present high angular resolution dust continuum (∼40 mas) and molecular line (∼150 mas) observations of the Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398-3359. The dust continuum is small, compact, and centrally peaked, while more extended dust structures are found in the outflow directions. We perform a 2D Gaussian fitting and find the deconvolved size and 2σ radius of the dust disk to be 4.5 × 2.8 au and 3.8 au, respectively. We estimate the gas+dust disk mass assuming optically thin continuum emission to be 0.6M <inf>J</inf>-1.8M <inf>J</inf>, indicating a very low mass disk. The CO isotopologues trace components of the outflows and inner envelope, while SO traces a compact, rotating disk-like component. Using several rotation curve fittings on the position-velocity diagram of the SO emission, the lower limits of the protostellar mass and gas disk radius are 0.022 M <inf>⊙</inf> and 31.2 au, respectively, from our Modified 2 single power-law fitting. A conservative upper limit of the protostellar mass is inferred to be 0.1 M <inf>⊙</inf>. The protostellar mass accretion rate and the specific angular momentum at the protostellar disk edge are found to be in the range of (1.3-6.1) × 10−6 M <inf>⊙</inf> yr−1 and (1.2-3.8) × 10−4 km s−1 pc, respectively, with an age estimated between 0.4 × 104 yr and 7.5 × 104 yr. At this young age with no clear substructures in the disk, planet formation would likely not yet have started. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution observations and systematic fitting procedures when deriving dynamical properties of deeply embedded Class 0 protostars. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We thank the anonymous referee for the helpful comments and suggestions on this manuscript.

Bradybaena similaris is a circumtropical land snail that is considered a non-native species from Southeast Asia or East Asia to Japan, which was believed to be introduced by human activities such as sugarcane or sweet potato establishment several hundred years ago. Bradybaena pellucida, a sister species of B. similaris, is native to western Japan, but has recently spread throughout the eastern part of the country. We investigated genetic diversification pattern of non-native organisms using the two land snail species. We clarified the phylogenetic relationships of B. similaris and B. pellucida based on genome-wide SNPs and mtDNA. We revealed the population demographic history using ABC analysis with SNP data. Bradybaena similaris of mainland Japan could be distinguished from populations on the continent. Introgressive hybridization between the species occurred approximately 29,700 years ago. The present findings provide two new hypotheses: that agriculture began in Japan about 2800 years ago, Japanese populations of B. similaris were introduced from the continent more than 29,000 years ago by human activity other than agriculture; or B. similaris is native to a part of mainland Japan. The history of a non-native species with human activity is complex, urging us to reconsider previous hypotheses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian tramp snail; Human activity; MIG-seq; Non-native species; Phylogenomics; Terrestrial mollusks","biological invasion; common land; conservation planning; demographic history; genome; human activity; hybridization; invasive species; native species; snail; terrestrial ecosystem; Japan; Southeast Asia","","","This study was supported by research grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellow Grant Number 15J01258 (Takahiro Hirano), JSPS Grant\u2010in\u2010Aid for Scientific Research 20K15872 (Takahiro Hirano), and Frontier Research in Duo (FRiD) of Tohoku University (Takahiro Hirano).","Alexander, David H., Enhancements to the ADMIXTURE algorithm for individual ancestry estimation, BMC Bioinformatics, 12, (2011); Yuriyagai, (1997); Colored Illustrations of the Land Snails of Japan, (1982); Biology of Terrestrial Molluscs, (2001); Bednaršek, Nina, Limacina helicina shell dissolution as an indicator of declining habitat suitability owing to ocean acidification in the California Current Ecosystem, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 281, 1785, (2014); Blackburn, Tim M., A proposed unified framework for biological invasions, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 26, 7, pp. 333-339, (2011); Blair, Christopher, Phylogenetic Trees and Networks Can Serve as Powerful and Complementary Approaches for Analysis of Genomic Data, Systematic Biology, 69, 3, pp. 593-601, (2020); Boivin, Nicole L., Ecological consequences of human niche construction: Examining long-term anthropogenic shaping of global species distributions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113, 23, pp. 6388-6396, (2016); Bolger, Anthony Michael, Trimmomatic: A flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data, Bioinformatics, 30, 15, pp. 2114-2120, (2014); USP Introduced Land Snails of the Fiji Islands Fact Sheet Series, (2012)","","Institute for Ionics","","","","","","13873547; 15731464","","BLINF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171728275"

Because SSF expansion is governed by multiphysical aspects, including electrical, thermal, and stress states, analysis of the mounted structure is important for improving power module design. We propose a practical design method that analyzes the critical condition due to SSF expansion using a combined method with a multiphysical finite element method (FEM) and phase field model based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. In preliminary studies, the thermal deformation of the demonstration module and the variation of threshold current of a bar-shaped SSF were verified from experimental and reference data. Estimating the SSF expansion rate on the constructed response surface under the mutiphysical inputs from FEM, the proposed design method can be used effectively in the design process by changing the various design variables. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FEM; forward degradation; phase field method; reliability design; SiC bipolar device; single Shockley stacking faults","Design; Finite element method; Phase transitions; Silicon; Stacking faults; Bipolar device; Electrical state; Electrical stress; Forward currents; Forward degradation; Phase field methods; Reliability design; SiC bipolar device; Single shockley stacking fault; Thermal state; Silicon carbide","","","The authors would like to thank S.

Since 1965, only a few studies with limited scope have been conducted on CHIKV in Vietnam. Thus, this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and molecular epidemiology of CHIKV infection among febrile patients in Vietnam from 2017 to 2019. A total of 1063 serum samples from 31 provinces were collected and tested for anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG ELISA. The 50% focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT<inf>50</inf>) was used to confirm CHIKV-neutralizing antibodies. Quantitative real-time RT–PCR (RT–qPCR) was performed to confirm the presence of the CHIKV genome. The results showed that 15.9% (169/1063) of the patients had anti-CHIKV IgM antibodies, 20.1% (214/1063) had anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies, 10.4% (111/1063) had CHIKV-neutralizing antibodies, and 27.7% (130/469) of the samples were positive in RT–qPCR analysis. The E1 CHIKV genome sequences were detected among the positive RT–qPCR samples. Our identified sequences belonged to the East/Central/South/African (ECSA) genotype, which has been prevalent in Vietnam previously, suggesting CHIKV has been maintained and is endemic in Vietnam. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of CHIKV infection in Vietnam and calls for an annual surveillance program to understand its impact. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","chikungunya; molecular epidemiology; seroprevalence; Vietnam","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; neutralizing antibody; adolescent; adult; agglutination test; antibody titer; Article; chikungunya; child; controlled study; DNA sequence; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; fever; genotype; human; immunofluorescence assay; limit of detection; major clinical study; male; molecular epidemiology; neutralization test; prevalence; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; serology; seroprevalence; Viet Nam; virus genome; virus neutralization","","immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9, 308067-58-5; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6","Funding text 1: This research was supported by AMED (Japan Agency of Medical Research and Development) under SCARDA grant number JP223fa627004h0001, JP233fa627004h0002; AMED under grant number, JP22wm0125006, JP22fk0108123 and JP20wm0225017; JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) under grant number 22KK0115; the Japan Research Foundation for Clinical Pharmacology; The Naito foundation grant for the next generation researcher; Takeda Science Foundation; and e-Asia under grant number JP22jm0210079h003, JP23jm0210079h004.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank all the study participants.

Moreover, the obtained supported Au nanoparticles (NPs) were effective as catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation, intramolecular cyclization of alkynyl carboxylic acids, and isomerization of allylic esters. Their results suggested that the reduction of [Au(OH)(IPr)] proceeds rapidly from around 300°C, and the residual ligands should be attached to the surface of the Au NPs and protect them from drastic agglutination. These results reveal that properly designed NHC-Au complexes can facilitate the preparation of supported Au NP catalysts with small particle sizes and high activities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gold nanoparticles; Heterogeneous catalysts; NHC-Au complexes; Soft Lewis acid catalysts, CO oxidation","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catalyst supports; Cyclization; Fiber optic sensors; Gold compounds; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Impregnation; Metal nanoparticles; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Sols; Thermogravimetric analysis; Titanium dioxide; X ray absorption; Au nanoparticle; Au-complexes; Complex precursors; Gold nanoparticle; Gold Nanoparticles; Heterogeneous catalyst; Lewis acid catalysts; N-heterocyclic carbene-au complex; N-heterocyclic carbenes; Soft lewis acid catalyst, CO oxidation; Gold nanoparticles","","","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the ALCA program (No: 11102798) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency, JSPS and NSFC under the Joint Research Program (JRP with NSFC, No. JPJSJRP20191804), and MEXT Grant-in-Aid for JSPS KAKENHI (No. 19K05152).

The genetic deletion of fibulin-4 (Fbln4) in smooth muscle cells (SMKO) leads to the formation of thoracic aortic aneurysms with the disruption of elastic fibers. Although Fbln4 is expressed in the entire vessel wall, its function in ECs and relevance to the maintenance of valvulo-arterial integrity are not fully understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gene silencing of FBLN4 was conducted on human aortic ECs to evaluate morphological changes and gene expression profile. Fbln4 double knockout (DKO) mice in ECs and smooth muscle cells were generated and subjected to histological analysis, echocardiography, Western blotting, RNA sequencing, and immunostaining. An evaluation of the thoracic aortic aneurysm phenotype and screening of altered signaling pathways were performed. Knockdown of FBLN4 in human aortic ECs induced mesenchymal cell– like changes with the upregulation of mesenchymal genes, including TAGLN and MYL9. DKO mice showed the exacerbation of thoracic aortic aneurysms when compared with those of SMKO and upregulated Thbs1, a mechanical stress– responsive molecule, throughout the aorta. DKO mice also showed progressive aortic valve thickening with collagen deposition from postnatal day 14, as well as turbulent flow in the ascending aorta. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and immunostaining of the aortic valve revealed the upregulation of genes involved in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inflammatory response, and tissue fibrosis in DKO valves and the presence of activated valve interstitial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The current study uncovers the pivotal role of endothelial fibulin-4 in the maintenance of valvulo-arterial integrity, which influences thoracic aortic aneurysm progression. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","aneurysm; aortic valve; endothelial cells; fibulin-4; smooth muscle cells","collagen; thrombospondin 1; transgelin; fibulin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aortic endothelial cell; aortic smooth muscle cell; aortic valve; Article; ascending aorta; cell structure; collagen metabolism; comparative study; controlled study; disease course; echocardiography; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; fibulin 4 gene; gene; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene knockdown; gene knockout; gene silencing; heart protection; histology; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; male; mechanical stress; mesenchyme cell; mouse; MYL9 gene; nonhuman; perinatal period; RNA sequencing; signal transduction; TAGLN gene; thoracic aorta aneurysm; turbulent flow; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; aorta; artery; endothelium cell; metabolism; pathology; smooth muscle cell; Animals; Aorta; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Arteries; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Mice; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle","","collagen, 9007-34-5; thrombospondin 1, 343987-56-4; fibulin","This work was supported in part by the Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology and Takeda Science Foundation, the MSD Life Science Foundation, KANAE Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Science, the NOVARTIS Foundation for the Promotion of Science, the MITSUBISHI Foundation, Japan Intractable Diseases (Nanbyo) Research Foundation (all to Y.Y.), as well as the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (grant number JP21H02677 to Y.Y. and JP20H03762 to H.Y.) and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (grant number JP21ek0210158 to Y.Y. and JP21ek0109553h001 to H.Y.).

The ALMA observations target continuum and lines at 1.3 mm with an angular resolution of ∼5 au. The continuum image reveals a dusty protostellar disk with a radius of ∼30 au seen close to edge-on and asymmetric structures along both the major and minor axes. While the asymmetry along the minor axis can be interpreted as the effect of the dust flaring, the asymmetry along the major axis comes from a real nonaxisymmetric structure. The C18O image cubes clearly show the gas in the disk that follows a Keplerian rotation pattern around a ∼0.14 M <inf>⊙</inf> central protostar. Furthermore, there are ∼1500 au scale streamer-like features of gas connecting from northeast, north-northwest, and northwest to the disk, as well as the bending outflow as seen in the 12CO (2-1) emission. At the apparent landing point of the NE streamer, there is SO (6<inf>5</inf>-5<inf>4</inf>) and SiO (5-4) emission detected. The spatial and velocity structure of the NE streamer can be interpreted as a free-falling gas with a conserved specific angular momentum, and the detection of the SO and SiO emission at the tip of the streamer implies the presence of accretion shocks. Our eDisk observations have unveiled that the Class 0 protostar in CB 68 has a Keplerian-rotating disk with a flaring and nonaxisymmetric structure associated with accretion streamers and outflows. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We are grateful to N.

As part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array large program, Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks, we analyze the edge-on, embedded, Class I protostar IRAS 04302+2247, also nicknamed the “Butterfly Star.” With a resolution of 0.″05 (8 au), the 1.3 mm continuum shows an asymmetry along the minor axis that is evidence of an optically thick and geometrically thick disk viewed nearly edge-on. There is no evidence of rings and gaps, which could be due to the lack of radial substructure or the highly inclined and optically thick view. With 0.″1 (16 au) resolution, we resolve the 2D snow surfaces, i.e., the boundary region between freeze-out and sublimation, for 12CO J = 2-1, 13CO J = 2-1, C18O J = 2-1, H <inf>2</inf>CO J = 3<inf>0,3</inf>-2<inf>0,2</inf>, and SO J = 6<inf>5</inf>-5<inf>4</inf>, and constrain the CO midplane snow line to ∼130 au. We find Keplerian rotation around a protostar of 1.6 ± 0.4 M <inf>⊙</inf> using C18O. Through forward ray-tracing using RADMC-3D, we find that the dust scale height is ∼6 au at a radius of 100 au from the central star and is comparable to the gas pressure scale height. The results suggest that the dust of this Class I source has yet to vertically settle significantly. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments.

As part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Large Program, we present high spatial resolution (∼0.″1 or ∼15 au) observations of the 1.3 mm continuum and 13CO J = 2-1, C18O J = 2-1, and SO J <inf>N </inf> = 6<inf>5</inf>-5<inf>4</inf> molecular lines toward the disk around the Class I protostar L1489 IRS. The continuum emission shows a ring-like structure at 56 au from the central protostar and tenuous, optically thin emission extending beyond ∼300 au. The 13CO emission traces the warm disk surface, while the C18O emission originates from near the disk midplane. The coincidence of the radial emission peak of C18O with the dust ring may indicate a gap-ring structure in the gaseous disk as well. The SO emission shows a highly complex distribution, including a compact, prominent component at ≲30 au, which is likely to originate from thermally sublimated SO molecules. The compact SO emission also shows a velocity gradient along a direction tilted slightly (∼15°) with respect to the major axis of the dust disk, which we interpret as an inner warped disk in addition to the warp around ∼200 au suggested by previous work. These warped structures may be formed by a planet or companion with an inclined orbit, or by a gradual change in the angular momentum axis during gas infall. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Funding text 1: ALMA is a partnership of ESO (representing its member states), NSF (USA) and NINS (Japan), together with NRC (Canada), MOST and ASIAA (Taiwan), and KASI (Republic of Korea), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.

The ubiquitous detections of substructures, particularly rings and gaps, in protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars raise the possibility that at least some planet formation may have already started during the embedded stages of star formation. In order to address exactly how and when planet formation is initiated, the program focuses on searching for substructures in disks around 12 Class 0 and 7 Class I protostars in nearby (<200 pc) star-forming regions through 1.3 mm continuum observations at a resolution of ∼7 au (0.″04). The initial results show that the continuum emission, mostly arising from dust disks around the sample protostars, has relatively few distinctive substructures, such as rings and spirals, in marked contrast to Class II disks. The dramatic difference may suggest that substructures quickly develop in disks when the systems evolve from protostars to Class II sources, or alternatively that high optical depth of the continuum emission could obscure internal structures. Kinematic information obtained through CO isotopologue lines and other lines reveals the presence of Keplerian disks around protostars, providing us with crucial physical parameters, in particular, the dynamical mass of the central protostars. We describe the background of the eDisk program, the sample selection and their ALMA observations, and the data reduction, and we also highlight representative first-look results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We would like to thank Elise Furlan, who kindly provided us with the Spitzer IRS spectra data for IRAS 04166+2702 and IRAS 04169+2709.

Both traits are often environmentally influenced, suggesting that a mechanism exists to coordinate these phenotypes in response to available maternal resources. Yet, how maternal resources are sensed and influence seed size and number is largely unknown. Here, we report a mechanism that senses maternal resources and coordinates grain size and number in the wild rice Oryza rufipogon, a wild progenitor of Asian cultivated rice. We showed that FT-like 9 (FTL9) regulates both grain size and number and that maternal photosynthetic assimilates induce FTL9 expression in leaves to act as a long-range signal that increases grain number and reduces size. Our findings highlight a strategy that benefits wild plants to survive in a fluctuating environment. In this strategy, when maternal resources are sufficient, wild plants increase their offspring number while preventing an increase in offspring size by the action of FTL9, which helps expand their habitats. In addition, we found that a loss-of-function allele (ftl9) is prevalent among wild and cultivated populations, offering a new scenario in the history of rice domestication. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS); grain number; grain size; maternal resources; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; wild Oryza","Grain (agricultural product); Grain size and shape; Plants (botany); Seed; Genome wide association study; Genome-wide association studies; Grain numbers; Grainsize; Maternal resource; Oryza rufipoga; Oryza sativa; Seed number; Seed size; Wild oryza; Genes; Grain; Increments; Leaves; Plants; Resources; Rice; domestication; food grain; genetics; metabolism; Oryza; phenotype; plant leaf; plant seed; Domestication; Edible Grain; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Seeds","","","Funding text 1: Seeds of a population and of CSSLs) were obtained from the National Institute of Genetics, Japan (Kurata et al., 2010 ; Nonomura et al., 2010 ; Sato et al., 2021 ) and Kyushu University supported by the National Bioresource project, MEXT, Japan.

This can be offset by greater investment in personal immune defences and/or the development of cooperative immune defences (social immunity). An enduring question in evolutionary biology is whether social-immune benefits arose in response to an increased need in more complex societies, or arose early in group living and helped facilitate the evolution of more complex societies. In this study, we shed light on this question through investigating how immunity varies intraspecifically in a socially polymorphic bee. Using a novel immune assay, we show that personal antibacterial efficacy in individuals from social nests is higher than that of solitary individuals, but that this can be explained by higher densities in social nests. We conclude that personal immune effects are likely to play a role in the social/solitary transition in this species. These patterns are consistent with the idea that social immunity evolved secondarily, following the evolution of group living. The flexibility of the individual immune system may have favoured a reliance on its use during the facultative phase early in social evolution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceratina; density-dependent prophylaxis; facultatively social; social immunity","bee; density dependence; evolution; evolutionary biology; facultative behavior; group size; immune response; immunity; parental investment; antiinfective agent; animal; social status; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bees; Social Status","","Anti-Bacterial Agents","This study was funded by Tokyo Metropolitan University and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant no.

The edible coating evaluated in this study is a composite of pregelatinized corn starch (PS), with a cellulose nano fiber (CF) Pickering emulsifier, and is enriched with basil essential oil (EO). The results of varying each parameter were then analyzed by the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to identify the best-performing edible coating. Using this method, the leading edible coating was identified as PS5EO3 formulized from 5% pregelatinized corn starch, 3% basil essential oil and 0.5% cellulose nanofiber, with a ranking of 0.721 based on quality content, and 0.676 based on percentage change in nutrients after the 12 days of storage at 25 °C.

PhAEV1 was detected by both cellulose affinity chromatography of dsRNA and high-throughput sequencing of total RNA, and its presence and sequence were confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The PhAEV1 genome, 12,820 nucleotides (nt) in length, was predicted to encode a single large polyprotein with the catalytic core domain of viral (superfamily 1) RNA helicase (HEL, amino acid [aa] positions 1,287-1,531), glycosyltransferase (GT, aa positions ca. 2,800-3,125), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp, aa positions 3,875-4,112). PhAEV1 is the most similar to Phytophthora cactorum alphaendornavirus 3, sharing 39.4% and 39.1% nt and aa sequence identity, respectively. In addition to the first 5′-terminal AUG codon, three additional in-frame methionine codons were found in close proximity (nt 14-16, 96-98, and 176-178), suggesting potential additional translation initiation sites. Conserved RdRp motifs (A-E) similar to those detected in related endornaviruses were identified in PhAEV1, as well as in several previously described alphaendornaviruses from other Phytophthora species in which these motifs had not been identified previously. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PhAEV1 clusters with members of the genus Alphaendornavirus in the family Endornaviridae and is basal to two other alphaendornaviruses described from another oomycete, Phytophthora cactorum. PhAEV1 is the first virus reported in P. heveae. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus RNA; amino acid sequence; genetics; open reading frame; phylogeny; Phytophthora; RNA virus; virus genome; Amino Acid Sequence; Genome, Viral; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; RNA Viruses; RNA, Viral; RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase","","coronavirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase; RNA directed RNA polymerase, 9026-28-2; RNA, Viral; RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase","Funding text 1: Open access publishing supported by the National Technical Library in Prague.

Keap1 is a repressor of Nrf2 in normal cellular conditions but also a stress sensor for Nrf2 activation. Interestingly, fish and amphibians have two Keap1s (Keap1a and Keap1b), of which Keap1b is the ortholog of mammalian Keap1. Keap1a, on the other hand, is a gene found only in fish and amphibians, having been lost during the evolution to amniotes. We have previously shown that keap1b-knockout zebrafish have increased Nrf2 activity and reduced response to certain Nrf2-activating compounds but that they grow normally to adulthood. This may be because the remaining keap1a suppresses the hyperactivation of Nrf2, which is responsible for the post-natal lethality of Keap1-knockout mice. In this study, we analyzed keap1a;keap1b-double-knockout zebrafish to test this hypothesis. We found that keap1a;keap1b-double-knockout zebrafish, like Keap1-knockout mice, showed eating defects and were lethal within a week of hatching. Genetic introduction of the Nrf2 mutation rescued both the eating defects and the larval lethality, indicating that Nrf2 hyperactivation is the cause. However, unlike Keap1-knockout mice, keap1a;keap1b-double-knockout zebrafish showed no physical blockage of the food pathway; moreover, the cause of death was not directly related to eating defects. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that keap1a;keap1b-double-knockout larvae showed extraordinarily high expression of known Nrf2-target genes as well as decreased expression of visual cycle genes.

A 2019 dengue outbreak resulted in a larger number of cases than any other outbreak. We conducted a molecular characterization using samples collected in 2019–2020 from dengue patients in Hanoi and nearby cities located in northern Vietnam. The circulating serotypes were DENV-1 (25%, n = 22) and DENV-2 (73%, n = 64). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all DENV-1 (n = 13) were genotype I and clustered to local strains circulating during the previous outbreak in the 2017, whereas DENV-2 consisted of two genotypes: Asian-I (n = 5), related to local strains from 2006–2022, and cosmopolitan (n = 18), the predominant genotype in this epidemic. The current cosmopolitan virus was identified as having an Asian-Pacific lineage. The virus was closely related to strains in other recent outbreaks in Southeast Asian countries and China. Multiple introductions occurred in 2016–2017, which were possibly from maritime Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia), mainland Southeast Asia (Cambodia and Thailand), or China, rather than from an expansion of localized Vietnamese cosmopolitan strains that were previously detected in the 2000s. We also analyzed the genetic relationship between Vietnam’s cosmopolitan strain and recent global strains reported from Asia, Oceania, Africa, and South America. This analysis revealed that viruses of Asian-Pacific lineage are not restricted to Asia but have spread to Peru and Brazil in South America. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DENV genotype; DENV-1; DENV-2; Hanoi; phylogenetic tree; Vietnam","","","","This research was funded by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development under grant numbers 20wm0225010h0101 and 21wm0225010h0102.

The primary objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting Vietnamese consumer intention to purchase safely certified vegetables (safe vegetables) based on an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 361 urban consumers in Hanoi city based on a stratified sampling technique, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the model. Findings: The results revealed that the extended TPB succeeded to predict 62% of the variance of intention to purchase safe vegetables. Attitude played the most important role in consumer intention. Notably, the attitude of consumers was the most largely influenced by subjective norms (social effects). Also, subjective norms had a direct effect on intention. Furthermore, consumer trust motivated a favorable attitude to increase purchase intention. The effects of past behavior on intention were verified as direct and indirect through subjective norm and trust combined with attitude. Few socio-demographic variables (e.g. age and education) were found to affect intention indirectly through attitude and subjective norm. Research limitations/implications: Further research on the relationship between intention and the actual purchase of safe food is needed. Originality/value: This extends the application of the TPB to predict consumer intention to purchase safely certified food in a developing country like Vietnam by examining both direct and indirect effects of socio-demographic variables, trust and past behavior on intention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer behavior; Food safety; Intention; Safe vegetables; TPB; Vietnam","","","","This work was funded by QR Program, Kyushu University, Japan.

Many researchers focus on a new technologies or materials to stabilise soil slopes. In this study, the novel geosynthetic cementitious composite mat (GCCM) was studied for its ability to reinforce soil slopes. A series of centrifuge tests were performed on the soil slope model under calibrated seepage and rainfall conditions. Medical gypsum plaster sheet, which has an equivalent strength and stiffness to GCCM, was used to reinforce a model soil slope. The results showed that GCCM-reinforcement could reduce slope displacement by contributing its high stiffness and creating an interface frictional force with the slope. In addition, the GCCM could delay the increase in pore-water pressure in the soil slope during rainfall, thus diminishing the hydraulic force acting on the slope, even if the slope surface was not fully covered by GCCMs. Overall, the results indicate that GCCM has good slope reinforcement potential. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cement; Centrifuge modelling; Composite material; Geotextiles and geomembranes; Slopes","Centrifuges; Rain; Reinforcement; Soils; Stiffness; Cementitious composites; Centrifuge models; Composites material; Geosynthetics; Geotextile and geomembrane; Mountainous area; Slope; Slope instability; Soil erosion; Soil slopes; Seepage; cement (construction material); centrifugal model test; composite; geomembrane; geosynthetics; geotextile; slope stability","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the Siam Cement Group (SCG) for providing some of the materials used in the tests.

Here, for the first time, we propose a monolayer Janus structure with the Mexican-hat band, γ-GeSSe, by replacing the S atoms on one side of the synthesized γ-GeS with Se atoms. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), we show that γ-GeSSe is mechanically, dynamically, and thermally stable. The mechanical, electronic, optical, and transport properties of monolayer Janus γ-GeSSe are also investigated in the DFT calculations. We find that the ideal strengths of the Janus γ-GeSSe are 6.08, 8.6, and 10.08 GPa for the armchair, zigzag, and biaxial directions, respectively. The Janus γ-GeSSe is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.131 eV. Our results show the Janus γ-GeSSe as a photocatalysis material for water splitting with a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 28.78%. This is because the combination of features includes an intrinsic electric field, high optical absorption coefficient, and carrier mobility. In addition, with the γ-structure, the Janus γ-GeSSe shows an intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity of 3.33 W/mK at room temperature, which will contribute to obtaining high TE efficiency. By using the Boltzmann transport theory, we find that the maximum TE power factor and figure of merit of the Janus γ-GeSSe reach 55-85 mW/mK2 and 0.7-0.9 in the temperature range from 300 to 900 K, respectively. Thus, our findings not only contribute to proposing a Janus material but also suggest that it can be used as an energy material with high-performance photocatalysis and TE. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","density functional theory; ideal strength; Janus monolayer; photocatalysis; thermoelectricity","Density functional theory; Electric fields; Energy gap; Hydrogen; Light absorption; Photocatalysis; Solar power generation; Statistical mechanics; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Density-functional-theory; Energy applications; First principle calculations; High performance material; Ideal strength; Janus monolayer; Mechanically stable; Synthesised; Thermally stable; Two-dimensional; Monolayers","","","N.T.H. acknowledges JSPS KAKENHI (No. JP20K15178), FRIS Creative Interdisciplinary Collaboration Program in Tohoku University, and financial support from the Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences in Tohoku University.","Fujishima, Akira, Electrochemical photolysis of water at a semiconductor electrode, Nature, 238, 5358, pp. 37-38, (1972); Wang, Zheng, Recent developments in heterogeneous photocatalysts for solar-driven overall water splitting, Chemical Society Reviews, 48, 7, pp. 2109-2125, (2019); Zhuang, Houlong, Computational search for single-layer transition-metal dichalcogenide photocatalysts, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 117, 40, pp. 20440-20445, (2013); Huang, Caijin, Carbon-doped BN nanosheets for metal-free photoredox catalysis, Nature Communications, 6, (2015); Hu, Wei, Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting over Edge-Modified Phosphorene Nanoribbons, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 139, 43, pp. 15429-15436, (2017); Guan, Shan, Tunable ferroelectricity and anisotropic electric transport in monolayer β -GeSe, Physical Review B, 97, 14, (2018); Hicks, L.

Although preliminary and fragmentary, as we were only able to observe them for a short period of time between March 18–23, 2023, we report here the first observations on the biology of the species in captivity, focusing on their preying behavior on centipedes. We captured two colonies (possibly fragments, containing several or many alate and dealate queens and no immatures) and a solitary dealate queen of O. hungvuong in Pu Hoat Nature Reserve, Nghe An, Vietnam. We could not confirm whether the two colonies contained mated reproductive queens and whether the solitary dealate queen was mated. We observed their reactions by offering some centipedes and juliform millipedes. Individuals from the colonies ignored juvenile juliform millipedes but readily paralyzed a geophilomorph (Mecistocephalus sp.), a lithobiomorph (Lithobius sp.), and two juvenile scolopendromorph centipedes (Scolopocryptops sp.) by stinging. Not only workers but also alate and dealate queens in the colonies aggressively attacked the centipedes. However, they failed to hunt a linotaeniid geophilomorph centipede (Strigamia sp.); the ants were quickly killed probably due to the chemical defense of the centipede. The solitary dealate queen also readily paralyzed a juvenile Scolopocryptops by sophisticated hunting behavior. The workers and dealate queens of O. hungvuong showed eager (apparently hemolymph) licking behavior on the paralyzed Mecistocephalus centipede. Our observations indicate that O. hungvuong is well-adapted for preying on certain active centipedes, although their exact prey repertoire and degree of prey specialization remain uncertain. Some other notes on their habitat, ovariole number, venom apparatus, and unique metasomal habitus are provided. We also discuss the functional roles of some female caste morphologies of O. hungvuong in their centipede hunting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","chemical defense; Chilopoda; Leptanillomorpha; predator–prey interaction; subterranean ant; Vietnam","","","","We would like to thank Drs Nguyen Van Sinh (Director of the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources (IEBR), Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam), Truong Xuan Lam (Vice Director of IEBR), Nguyen Duc Anh (IEBR), Nguyen Quang Cuong (IEBR), and the staff of Pu Hoat Nature Reserve for their help in the field survey and managing research permissions; Dr Nguyen Thi Phuong Lien (IEBR) for kindly allowing us to use microscopes and video/image recording systems in IEBR; Dr Sho Tsukamoto for his advice on the identification of centipedes; two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and critiques on the manuscript.

The primary focus of this article is to evaluate the performance of LSP-DS on meteorological variables, specifically temperature and humidity. In details, LSP-DS, which is based on the NCAR’s Noah Multi-Parameterizations land surface model, incorporated by recently developed land use/cover data for Vietnam released by JAXA, is forced by ERA5 data for 2013; and the results are compared with ground-based station observations. The results exhibit excellent performance of LSP-DS versus observations with consistently high correlation coefficient between the two, highlighting the high potential of using LSP-DS for real-time operational forecast. The LSP-DS performance varies with different sub land use/cover categories, implying that the proper parameter settings could be key point for improvement. The findings of this research underscore the dual strengths of the LSP-DS approach: its computational efficiency and its remarkable efficacy in predicting spatial heterogeneity of local climates. These attributes render it well-suited for agrometeorological forecasting in a tropical monsoon climate, exemplified by the Red River Delta in Vietnam. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study was supported by the project of \u201CAdvanced research in agricultural climate forecasting technology.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rapid thawing in water at 70 °C by using various post-thawed parameters of frozen bull spermatozoa. Experiment 1, monitoring the change of temperature inside frozen bull straw thawed in water at different temperatures. Experiment 2, evaluation of various post-thawed characteristics of frozen bull spermatozoa thawed in water at different temperatures by using a computer-assisted sperm analysis, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. The time it took for the temperature inside the straw to warm up to 15 °C was nearly twice as faster when the straw was thawed in 70 °C water compared with 39 °C. Although there were differences among bulls, viability, motility, and mitochondrial membrane potential of spermatozoa thawed at 70 °C for 8 seconds and stabilized at 39 °C for 52 seconds were significantly higher than those of controls (thawed at 39 °C for 60 seconds) at 0 and 3 h after thawing. Just after thawing, however, there were no differences in acrosome integrity and distribution of phospholipase C zeta1, whereas mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production was significantly lower in spermatozoa thawed at 70 °C. From these results, we conclude that rapid thawing at 70 °C and then stabilization at 39 °C significantly improves viability, motility and mitochondrial health of bull spermatozoa rather than conventional thawing at 39 °C.

Patients in older age groups with high viral load and severe immunologic response during acute infection are likely to develop chronic arthritis and severe joint pain. Currently, no antiviral drug is available. Previous studies suggested that a flavone derivative, 8-bromobaicalein, was a potential dengue and Zika replication inhibitor in a cell-based system targeting flaviviral polymerase. Here we characterized that 8-bromobaicalein inhibited chikungunya virus replication with EC<inf>50</inf> of 0.49 ± 0.11 µM in Vero cells. The molecular target predicted at viral nsP1 methyltransferase using molecular binding and fragment molecular orbital calculation. Additionally, oral administration of 250 mg/kg twice daily treatment alleviated chikungunya-induced musculoskeletal inflammation and reduced viral load in healthy adult mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the 250 mg/kg administration maintained the compound level above EC<inf>99.9</inf> for 12 h. Therefore, 8-bromobaicalein should be a potential candidate for further development as a pan-arboviral drug. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","8-bromobaicalein; chikungunya virus; Drug discovery; flavone derivatives; flavonoid; in vivo efficacy","8 bromobaicalein; antivirus agent; baicalein; flavone derivative; methyltransferase; nonstructural protein 1; unclassified drug; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral activity; area under the curve; arthritis; Article; chikungunya; controlled study; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug efficacy; drug half life; EC50; maximum plasma concentration; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; mouse; multiple drug dose; nonhuman; plasma concentration-time curve; single drug dose; time to maximum plasma concentration; Vero cell line; virus load; virus replication; volume of distribution; aged; animal; Arbovirus; Chikungunya virus; Chlorocebus aethiops; human; inflammation; physiology; Zika fever; Zika virus; Adult; Aged; Animals; Arboviruses; Chikungunya Fever; Humans; Inflammation; Mice; Vero Cells; Viral Load; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","","baicalein, 491-67-8; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4","This work was mainly supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University (FF67), and Chulalongkorn University (RA66-025) to S.B.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how effluent recirculation affects the two-stage anaerobic digestion of biodegradable municipal solid waste. METHODS: Firstly, biodegradable municipal solid waste substrate was fermented under conditions of 12 percent initial total solids and a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius for 5 days. After that, the substrate continued to be diluted using tap water or the effluent stream with a rate of 2:1. In the case of using the effluent stream, the experiment was further performed with dilution rates of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:2. Then, the liquid part was collected and pumped into the methane reactor at an organic loading rate of 7.64 grams of total solids per liter per day at 36 degrees Celsius. The methane reactor was an up-flow reactor that contained both granular sludge and suspended sludge. The effectiveness of the experimental stages was evaluated through biogas production and chemical oxygen demand removal. FINDINGS: In the fermentative reactor, using the effluent stream to dilute solid-state feedstock helped keep the reactor stable at pH 5.5 without alkali addition. In the case of using tap water for dilution, it required a dose of 115.8 grams and 75.3 grams of sodium hydroxide per kilogram of volatile solids to attain pH conditions at 6.5 and 5.5, respectively. Maintaining the reactor at pH 6.5 increased the concentration of fermentation products compared to pH 5.5, including 5.9 percent total chemical oxygen demand, 5.5 percent soluble chemical oxygen demand, and 10.6 percent total volatile fatty acids. In the case of recirculating the effluent stream in the methane reactor, increasing the dilution rate from 0.5 to 3.0 resulted in a methane yield of 227.5-278.9 milliliter per gram of volatile solids and 85-93 percent chemical oxygen demand removal. The methane reactor’s best digestion performance was attained at recirculation rate 2. Methane formation mainly occurred in granular sludge via the hydrogenotrophic pathway. Methane formation in suspended sludge occurred in a secondary manner, mainly via both the hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic pathways. Among methanogen families, Methanobacteriaceae was found to have the highest relative abundance (7.5 percent in granular sludge and 0.8 percent in suspended sludge). CONCLUSION: Recirculating the effluent provided significant benefits, including the ability to stabilize the hydrolysis process and increase the methane yield. A recirculation rate of 2 to obtain a total chemical oxygen demand of 35.2 grams per liter was the best condition for methanogenesis. Acetotrophic methanogens were better adapted to difficult conditions than hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The formation of methane mainly occurred in granular sludge via a dominant hydrogenotrophic pathway. Methane formation in suspended sludge occurred in a secondary manner, mainly via both the hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic pathways. Among methanogen families, Methanobacteriaceae was found to have the highest relative abundance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradable solid waste; Fermentation; Recirculation; Two-stage anaerobic digestion","anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; effluent; fermentation; municipal solid waste; waste treatment","","","This study is funded by the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training under [Grant number B2021-XDA-03].

Understanding their genetic variation and selecting a representative subset (“core collection”) are essential for optimal management and efficient use of genetic resources. In this study, we conducted genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to characterize the genetic relationships and population structure in 755 accessions of melon genetic resources. The GBS identified 39,324 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are distributed throughout the melon genome with high density (one SNP/10.6 kb). The phylogenetic relationships and population structure inferred using this SNP dataset are highly associated with the cytoplasm type and geographical origin. Our results strongly support the recent hypothesis that cultivated melon was established in Africa and India through multiple independent domestication events.

Diphtheria is a potentially life-threatening infection and remains endemic in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A reliable, low-cost method for serosurveys in LMICs is warranted to estimate the accurate population immunity to control diphtheria. Hypothesis/Gap Statement. The correlation between the ELISA results against diphtheria toxoid and the gold standard diphtheria toxin neutralization test (TNT) values is poor when ELISA values are <0.1 IU ml−1, which results in inaccurate estimates of susceptibility in populations when ELISA is used for measuring antibody levels. Aim. To explore methods to accurately predict population immunity and TNT-derived anti-toxin titres from ELISA anti-toxoid results. Methodology. A total of 96 paired serum and dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected in Vietnam were used for comparison of TNT and ELISA. The diagnostic accuracy of ELISA measurement with reference to TNT was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and other parameters. Optimal ELISA cut-off values corresponding to TNT cut-off values of 0.01 and 0.1 IU ml−1 were identified by ROC analysis. A method based on the multiple imputation approach was also applied to estimate TNT measurements in a dataset that only included ELISA results. These two approaches were then applied to ELISA results previously generated from 510 subjects in a serosurvey in Vietnam. Results. The ELISA results on DBS samples showed a good diagnostic performance compared to TNT. The cut-off values for ELISA measurement corresponding to the TNT cut-off values of 0.01 IU ml−1 were 0.060 IU ml−1 in serum samples, and 0.044 IU ml−1 in DBS samples. When a cut-off value of 0.06 IU ml−1 was applied to the 510 subject serosurvey data, 54% of the population were considered susceptible (<0.01 IU ml−1). The multiple imputation-based approach estimated that 35% of the population were susceptible. These proportions were much larger than the susceptible proportion estimated by the original ELISA measurements. Conclusion. Testing a subset of sera by TNT combined with ROC analysis or a multiple imputation approach helps to adjust ELISA thresholds or values to assess population susceptibility more accurately. DBS is an effective low-cost alternative to serum for future serological studies for diphtheria. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assay validation; diphtheria; dried blood spots; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; multiple imputation; toxin neutralization assay","diphtheria antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; diphtheria toxin; adolescent; adult; antibody blood level; antibody titer; area under the curve; Article; child; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; diphtheria; diphtheria toxin neutralization test; dried blood spot testing; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; herd immunity; human; in vitro study; infant; infection sensitivity; major clinical study; male; multiple imputation; newborn; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; seroprevalence; statistical analysis; validation study; Viet Nam; neutralization test; procedures; serology; Diphtheria; Diphtheria Toxin; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Neutralization Tests; Serologic Tests","","Diphtheria Toxin","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Nagasaki University WISE programme (Nagasaki University ‘Doctoral Program for World-Leading Innovative and Smart Education’ for Global Health, KENKYU SHIDO KEIHI – the research grant) and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI grant number JP20K18905.

Here, we investigated the effect on the thoracic limb rate (TLR) of the water flea Simocephalus vetulus under the combined exposure of DFX (0, 100, 200, and 400 &amp;#xb5;g L&amp;#x2212;1) and calcium (Ca) (26 and 78 mg L&amp;#x2212;1) using Bayesian statistics-based linear models. The findings showed unexpected increases and decreases in the TLR of maternal S. vetulus exposed to DFX in the 26 mg Ca L&amp;#x2212;1. In the 78 mg Ca L&amp;#x2212;1 condition, we found a clearer decrease in TLR during DFX treatments. In addition, in the 26 mg Ca L&amp;#x2212;1, elusive changes in the TLR of neonatal S. vetulus whose mothers were exposed to DFX were observed, whereas the reduced TLR of the neonate, whose mother was exposed to 400 &amp;#xb5;g DFX L&amp;#x2212;1, was apparent in the higher Ca condition. While the elevated Ca content did not appear to have a clear effect on organisms&amp;#x2019; TLR, it acted as a synergist in conjunction with DFX, leading to a reduction in TLR, the underlying mechanism of which remains poorly understood. The results of our study indicate that DFX may pose an ecological risk as a xenobiotic; therefore, taking into account the abundance of Ca in specific aquatic environments, a comprehensive ecological risk assessment should be conducted. Moreover, the inclusion of Bayesian statistics in ecotoxicological studies is highly recommended to improve data analysis and interpretation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibiotic pollution; Bayesian statistics; ecological risk assessment; synergistic interaction; transgenerational effect","","","","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number: 20K20640), Japan, and Nagasaki University WISE Programme Research, Japan.

Our results show distinct scattering features when varying the various scattering parameters, thereby allowing the identification of the scattering particle with specific application to the identification of atmospheric pollutants including black carbon. Regardless of the type of scatterer, the scattering intensity is nearly uniform with a slight preference for forward scattering when the size of the particle is within 20% of the incident laser’s wavelength. The scattering patterns start to exhibit distinguishable features when the size parameter equals 1.77, corresponding to an incident laser wavelength of 0.355 μm and a particle radius of 0.1 μm. The patterns then become increasingly unique as the size parameter increases. Based on these calculations, we propose a time-gated lidar scheme consisting of multiple detectors that can rotate through a telescopic angle and be placed equidistantly around the scattering particles to collect the backscattered light and a commercially available Q-switched laser system emitting at tunable laser wavelengths. By using a pulsed laser with 10-ns pulse duration, our scheme could distinguish scattering centers that are at least 3 m apart. Our scheme called MIe Scattering Time-gated multi-Static LIDAR (MISTS–LIDAR) would be capable of identifying the type of atmospheric pollutant and mapping its location with a spatial resolution of a few meters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","atmospheric monitoring of pollutants; black carbon; LIDAR; MIe scattering; particulate matter","","","","This research was funded by the Osaka University ASEAN Campuses, the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology under Project No. VAST01.03/22-23 and the Institute of Laser Engineering Collaborative Research Fund (2020B1-003 and 2022B1-004).","undefined; Durdina, Lukas, Nonvolatile Particulate Matter Emissions of a Business Jet Measured at Ground Level and Estimated for Cruising Altitudes, Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 21, pp. 12865-12872, (2019); Panahifar, Hossein, Monitoring atmospheric particulate matters using vertically resolved measurements of a polarization lidar, in-situ recordings and satellite data over Tehran, Iran, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Liu, Zheng, Semi-volatile organic compounds in fine particulate matter on a tropical island in the South China Sea, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 426, (2022); Proceedings of the Awma Specialty Conference Pm 2000; Ross Hallett, F., Particle size analysis by dynamic light scattering, Food Research International, 27, 2, pp. 195-198, (1994); Koestner, Daniel W., Polarized light scattering measurements as a means to characterize particle size and composition of natural assemblages of marine particles, Applied Optics, 59, 27, pp. 8314-8334, (2020); Siebert, Karl J., Relationship of particle size to light scattering, Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists, 58, 3, pp. 97-100, (2000); Lockwood, David J., Rayleigh and Mie Scattering, pp. 1097-1107, (2016); Wyatt, Philip J., Differential light scattering and the measurement of molecules and nanoparticles: A review, Analytica Chimica Acta: X, 7-8, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145843671"

Seroprevalence was further compared with that of an urban area that had no cases reported for the past decade. Carriage prevalence was 1.4%. The highest prevalence, 4.5%, was observed for children 1–5 years of age. Twenty-seven asymptomatic Coerynebacterium diphtheriae carriers were identified; 9 carriers had tox gene–bearing strains, and 3 had nontoxigenic tox gene–bearing strains. Child malnutrition was associated with low levels of diphtheria toxoid IgG, which might have subsequently increased child carriage prevalence. Different immunity patterns in the 2 populations suggested that the low immunity among children caused by low vaccination coverage increased transmission, resulting in symptomatic infections at school-going age, when vaccine-induced immunity waned most. A school-entry booster dose and improved infant vaccination coverage are recommended to control transmissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; green fluorescent protein; immunoglobulin G; toxin; toxoid; vaccine; adult; Article; child; clinical article; controlled study; Corynebacterium diphtheriae; Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis; Corynebacterium ulcerans; cross-sectional study; diphtheria; disease control; disease transmission; DNA extraction; dried blood spot testing; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; female; hand washing; health care personnel; health survey; household; human; immunoglobulin blood level; infant; livestock; male; malnutrition; middle aged; nutritional status; preschool child; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; seroepidemiology; seroprevalence; vaccination; vein puncture; Viet Nam; Corynebacterium; genetics; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diphtheria; Humans; Infant; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Vaccination; Vietnam","","immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9, 308067-58-5","Funding text 1: This study was supported the Nagasaki University WISE Program (Nagasaki University Doctoral Program for World-Leading Innovative and Smart Education for Global Health, KENKYU SHIDO KEIHI Research Grant); the Japan Program for Infectious Diseases Research and Infrastructure; the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (grant JP21wm0125006]; and JSPS KAKENHI (grant JP20K18905).; Funding text 2: We thank the staff at the Institut Pasteur in Nha Trang, Vietnam, and Quang Ngai Provincial Health Services for conducting the field survey; persons for participating in the study and surveys; Norman K.

However, understanding of service quality and satisfaction relations has been limited. This study seeks an appropriate method to demonstrate the nature of service quality-satisfaction relations. Thereby, research results can be methodologically, theoretically, and empirically defensible. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) and the three-factor theory, the most widely preferred for public transport service quality prioritization based on the importance of service factors to rider satisfaction, will be utilized. The study takes transit service in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, to demonstrate that the three-factor theory, which has been limitedly utilized despite being more advantageous and robust, is superior to the IPA. Although the extent to which the service quality factors affect satisfaction varied across rider segments, the types of service quality factors were found consistent. For example, captive riders considered all service factors as performance. Non-captive riders considered the environment factor as excitement. No basic factor was found across rider groups. This study contributes to the limited understanding of the non-linear and asymmetric relations between service quality and satisfaction of various rider groups, which is rarely found in transit service quality literature. Furthermore, it introduced a case study of Vietnamese urban transit services for the first time. It suggests that enhancing passenger information, rider care, and comfort are recommended as the most practical and economical measures in the short run. However, the city government should improve availability and accessibility to promote public transport ridership in the long run. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Importance-performance analysis; Public transport; Rider satisfaction; Rider segments; Service quality; Three-factor theory","Factor analysis; Quality control; Importance-performance analysis; Prioritization; Public transport; Public transport service; Rider satisfaction; Rider segment; Service Quality; Service satisfaction; Three-factor theory; Transit services; Quality of service; performance assessment; prioritization; public transport; service quality; strategic approach; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the World Bank for the data.

Cytoglobin (CYGB), a hemeprotein involved in liver fibrosis and cancer development, is expressed in pericytes of all organs. Here, we examined the role of CYGB in the development of pancreatic cancer. CYGB expression appeared predominately in the area surrounding adenocarcinoma and negatively correlated with tumor size in patients with pancreatic cancer. Directly injecting 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene into the pancreatic tail in wild-type mice resulted in time-dependent induction of severe pancreatitis, fibrosis, and oxidative damage, which was rescued by Cygb overexpression in transgenic mice. Pancreatic cancer incidence was 93% in wild-type mice but only 55% in transgenic mice. Enhanced CYGB expression in human pancreatic stellate cells in vitro reduced cellular collagen synthesis, inhibited cell activation, increased expression of antioxidant-related genes, and increased CYGB secretion into the medium. Cygb-overexpressing or recombinant human CYGB (rhCYGB) -treated MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells exhibited dose-dependent cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, diminished cell migration, and reduction in colony formation. RNA sequencing in rhCYGB-treated MIA PaCa-2 cells revealed downregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. An increase in MIA PaCa-2 cell proliferation and reactive oxygen species production by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> challenge was blocked by rhCYGB treatment or Cygb overexpression. PANC-1, OCUP-A2, and BxPC-3 cancer cells showed similar responses to rhCYGB. Known antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione also inhibited cancer cell growth. These results demonstrate that CYGB suppresses pancreatic stellate cell activation, pancreatic fibrosis, and tumor growth, suggesting its potential therapeutic application against pancreatic cancer. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; acetylcysteine; cytoglobin; glutathione; hydrogen peroxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; recombinant human cytoglobin; recombinant protein; toluene; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antitumorigenic activity; Article; BxPC-3 cell line; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cancer inhibition; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; cell activation; cell cycle G1 phase; cell migration; collagen synthesis; controlled study; cystic fibrosis; down regulation; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; major clinical study; male; MIA PaCa-2 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; OCUP A2 cell line; overall survival; oxidative phosphorylation; oxidative stress; PANC-1 cell line; pancreas cancer; pancreatic stellate cell; pancreatitis; pericyte; protein expression; RNA sequencing; transgenic mouse; tumor volume; wild type mouse","","7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 57-97-6; acetylcysteine, 616-91-1; glutathione, 70-18-8; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; toluene, 108-88-3","We thank Dr. Kazuo Ikeda, Dr. Tsutomu Matsubara, and Mr. Yoshinori Okina for their helpful discussion.

There is evidence that SCCmec disseminates among staphylococci, but the transfer mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that two-component systems mediate the upregulation of natural competence genes in S. aureus under biofilm growth conditions, and this enhances the efficiency of natural transformation. We observe SCCmec transfer via natural transformation from MRSA, and from methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. The process requires the SCCmec recombinase genes ccrAB, and the stability of the transferred SCCmec varies depending on SCCmec types and recipients. Our results suggest that natural transformation plays a role in the transfer of SCCmec and possibly other mobile genetic elements in S. aureus biofilms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","bacitracin; bacterial DNA; cefmetazole; cefoxitin; Nef protein; nisin; oxacillin; tetracycline; vancomycin; bacterial protein; antibiotic resistance; biofilm; gene expression; gene flow; 5' untranslated region; accessory gene regulator; Article; bacterial chromosome; biotransformation; cephalosporin resistance; colony forming unit; conjugative plasmid; controlled study; deletion mutant; DNA transfer; fluorescence microscopy; genome size; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; minimum inhibitory concentration; mobile genetic element; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; operon; penicillin resistance; promoter region; quorum sensing; staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec; tetracycline resistance; vancomycin resistance; vector control; genetics; human; methicillin resistance; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; Bacterial Proteins; Biofilms; Humans; Methicillin Resistance; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcal Infections","","bacitracin, 1405-87-4; cefmetazole, 56796-20-4, 56796-39-5; cefoxitin, 33564-30-6, 35607-66-0; nisin, 1414-45-5; oxacillin, 1173-88-2, 66-79-5, 7240-38-2; tetracycline, 23843-90-5, 60-54-8, 64-75-5, 8021-86-1; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9; Bacterial Proteins","This study was supported by Takeda Science Foundation, The Waksman Foundation of Japan, Pfizer Academic Contributions, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 25860313 and 18H02652, JSPS Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects JPJSBP120199916 (to KM), and Program to Disseminate Tenure Tracking System, MEXT (to RLO).

This paper employs indicator-based approach to calculate Flood Vulnerability Index and generates vulnerability maps that reflect the spatial distribution of flood vulnerability in the Central region of Vietnam, which is the hardest hit flood region and home to many sites of great cultural-historical value. Data were collected from Hoi An’s 2020 statistical yearbook, digital elevation model, land use map, open street map and from surveying experts and civil servants at the city level (representatives of the City People’s Committee, the Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation of Hoi An) and at ward/commune level (representatives of 12 wards and communes). GIS techniques and analytical hierarchy process were applied to analysis the obtained data and generate three scenarios that reflect the impact of vulnerability’s components. The findings indicate that number of organizations in disaster prevention and historical site preservation, road density, the presence of historical sites, flood frequency and average elevation are the key factors affecting the city’s vulnerability to flood hazard in the area of cultural heritage. The empirical results in Hoi An also indicate the importance of the number of poor households as an necessary factor when considering the sensitivity to flood in developing countries. In addition, this study distinguishes the impact of vulnerability’s components by generating different scenarios which clearly proof that having more floods does not always mean high vulnerability and vice versa. More importantly, by looking into the reasons (either transportation, education or other indicators) that leads to the gap between Flood Vulnerability Index in different scenarios, the paper subsequently identifies measures for each locality, whereby the governmental investment budget can be prioritized effectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytic hierarchy process; Cultural heritage area; Flood vulnerability index; GIS; Indicator-based approach; Vietnam","analytical hierarchy process; developing world; environmental assessment; flood damage; flooding; numerical model; sensitivity analysis; vulnerability; Hoi An; Viet Nam","","","The authors very grateful to the support from the People's Committee (PC), and the Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation (CCHMP) of Hoi An city for helping with data collection.

Being a multi-subunit complex, its macromolecular organization affects the dynamics of photosynthetic membranes. Here we reveal a chloroplast PSI from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that is organized as a homodimer, comprising 40 protein subunits with 118 transmembrane helices that provide scaffold for 568 pigments. Cryogenic electron microscopy identified that the absence of PsaH and Lhca2 gives rise to a head-to-head relative orientation of the PSI–light-harvesting complex I monomers in a way that is essentially different from the oligomer formation in cyanobacteria. The light-harvesting protein Lhca9 is the key element for mediating this dimerization. The interface between the monomers is lacking PsaH and thus partially overlaps with the surface area that would bind one of the light-harvesting complex II complexes in state transitions. We also define the most accurate available PSI–light-harvesting complex I model at 2.3 Å resolution, including a flexibly bound electron donor plastocyanin, and assign correct identities and orientations to all the pigments, as well as 621 water molecules that affect energy transfer pathways. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","plastocyanin; water; cyanobacterium; light harvesting system; metabolism; photosystem I; photosystem II; protein subunit; Cyanobacteria; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Photosystem I Protein Complex; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plastocyanin; Protein Subunits; Water","","plastocyanin, 9014-09-9; water, 7732-18-5; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Photosystem I Protein Complex; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plastocyanin; Protein Subunits; Water","The cryo-EM data were collected at the SciLifeLab facility (funded by the KAW, EPS and Kempe foundations) and the Karolinska Institutet 3D-EM facility.

We elucidated that hepatotoxin-damaged and fibrotic livers gave rise to LSECs-iGap formation, which was positively correlated with increased numbers of metastatic liver foci after intrasplenic injection of Hepa1-6 cells. Hepa1-6 cells induced interleukin-23-dependent tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion by LSECs and triggered LSECs-iGap formation, toward which their processes protruded to transmigrate into the liver parenchyma. TNF-α triggered depolymerization of F-actin and induced matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), intracellular adhesion molecule 1, and CXCL expression in LSECs. Blocking MMP9 activity by doxycycline or an MMP2/9 inhibitor eliminated LSECs-iGap formation and attenuated liver metastasis of Hepa1-6 cells. Overall, this study revealed that cancer cells induced LSEC-iGap formation via proinflammatory paracrine mechanisms and proposed MMP9 as a favorable target for blocking cancer cell metastasis to the liver. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Cell death; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Pathology; Proteins; Cancer cells; Cell/B.E; Gap formation; Liver metastasis; Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; Matrix metalloproteinase-9; Paracrine; Proinflammatory; Sinusoidal endothelial cells; Tumor necrosis factors; actin; doxycycline; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; interleukin 23; tumor necrosis factor; animal; endothelium cell; human; inbred mouse strain; liver; liver tumor; metabolism; mouse; pathology; Actins; Animals; Doxycycline; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Interleukin-23; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","","doxycycline, 10592-13-9, 17086-28-1, 564-25-0, 94088-85-4; gelatinase A, 146480-35-5; gelatinase B, 146480-36-6; Actins; Doxycycline; Interleukin-23; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","We would like to express our deepest appreciation to L.

The generation and characterisation of tourism waste were based on a sampling survey of Hoi An city (HAC). Problems and challenges of a tourism waste management system were indicated using material flow analysis. Five scenarios were developed for the tourism sector of the city based on current solid waste management practice (SWMP), a consensus of stakeholders, the suitability of waste management systems and the contribution of the government. In two of the scenarios, waste reduction was 6.5 times higher and recyclables recovered was 3.3–4.2 times greater than that in two of the minimalist scenarios. Furthermore, the former scenarios showed more efficiency in treatment, optimal economy and minimum greenhouse gas emissions. The study indicated the advantages and challenges of each scenario and identified an optimal model for SWMP for the tourism industry of HAC. A framework for gradually developing a sustainable tourism waste management system was proposed, potentially applicable to any tourist city in a developing country. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","developing countries; sustainability; sustainable development; UN SDG 13: Climate action","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Tourism; Waste management; Integrated solid waste managements; Materials flow analysis; Problems and challenges; Sampling survey; Solid waste management; Tourism sectors; UN SDG 13: climate action; Viet Nam; Waste management practices; Waste management systems; Developing countries","","","The authors especially acknowledge The People Committee of Hoi An city for their support.

We show that in the case of the superlattice graphene Brillouin zone (SBZ) center folded into the primitive graphene Brillouin zone (GBZ) corner, the emergence of different replica Dirac cones and their scattering behaviors are driven by the substrate-induced potential or atomic-scale disorders as well as by the correlation between the rotation angle of the superlattice and the trigonal warping orientation of the Dirac cone because of the quantum interference associated with the scattering at the SBZ edge. In particular, a superlattice with a rotational angle of φ = 30° (G-N√3 × N√3-R30°, N > 1) facilitates intervalley scattering, whereas an unrotated superlattice (G-N3 × N3) is favorable to intravalley scattering. For a superlattice with a rotational angle in the range of 0 < φ < 30°, the intervalley and intravalley scatterings may be comparable to each other, leading to the emergence of mixed inequivalent replica cones at the SBZ center (or GBZ corner). Interestingly, such inequivalent replica cones facilitate a stronger intervalley scattering at the GBZ corner, compared to the G-N√3 × N√3-R30° and G-N3 × N3 superlattices, thus opening a larger energy gap at the primitive Dirac point. In addition to the inversion symmetry breaking in graphene, we show that intervalley scattering can also generate an energy gap at the secondary Dirac point. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Atoms; Density functional theory; Energy gap; A: semiconductors; Atomic scale; Brillouin zones; Dirac cones; Dirac point; Graphene superlattices; Intervalley scattering; Rotational angle; Semi-conductor surfaces; Short wavelengths; Graphene","","","Based on the research collaboration between the Center for Innovative Materials and Architectures (INOMAR, VNU-HCM) with Prof. Yoshiyuki Kawazoe (Tohoku University) and the Key Laboratory on Multiscale Simulation of Complex (MSCS, VNU-HN), the authors express their sincere thanks to Tohoku University and MSCS, VNU-HN, for their continuous support and help in using the MASAMUNE-IMR, CRAY-XC50 supercomputing facilities.

The results show that approximately 61–81 % of the suspended sediment load in the Hau River during the flood seasons is diverted from the Tien River by a water and suspended sediment diversion channel. Tidal effects on flow and suspended sediment load are more pronounced in the Hau River than in the Tien River. The results show the formation of nine scour holes in the Tien River and seven scour holes in the Hau River from 2014 to 2017. Additional six scour holes are likely to form by the end of 2026 if the suspended sediment supply is reduced by 85 % due to damming. Notably, the scour holes are likely to form at locations of severe riverbank erosion. In the entire study area, the simulated total net incision volume in 2014–2017 is approximately 196 Mm3 (equivalent to 65.3 Mm3/yr). The predicted total net incision volumes from 2017 to 2026 are approximately 2472 and 3316 Mm3 under the 18 % and 85 % suspended sediment reduction scenarios, respectively, thereby likely threatening the delta sustainability. The methodology developed in this study is helpful in providing researchers and decision-makers with one way to predict numerically the scour hole formation and its association with riverbank stability in river deltas. Of equal importance, this research serves as a useful reference on the role of water and suspended sediment diversion channels in balancing landforms in river-delta systems, particularly where artificial diversion channels are planned. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2D numerical modelling; Diversion channel; Morphological change; Riverbed incision; Scour hole; Sediment reduction","bank erosion; computer simulation; delta; fluvial geomorphology; geomorphological response; hydrodynamics; morphodynamics; numerical model; river bank; scour; sediment transport; suspended sediment; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the Mekong River Commission and the Vietnam National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting for providing the data.

In Hoi An city (HAC), the solid waste management (SWM) system in the tourism area (TA) in downtown is facing many urgent problems such as the overload of waste, the inefficiency in the collection system, and the loss of revenues from tipping fee. Aiming to reduce these gaps, five scenarios of the SWM models are built based on the practical issues, the assumption on enhancing of SWM practice, improving the SWM collection, and approving the waste regulation from local government. The optimisation and feasibility of an SWM model were analysed and assessed based on the efficiency of the collection system, the enhancement of recycling practice, the consensus of stakeholders, the favourability for treatment, and the optimisation of economic benefits. The results revealed that the SWM scenario 1 (S1) and S2 get a more positive response from stakeholders (especially commercial sectors) by the high consensus and willingness to pay the higher tipping fee (1.2 times) due to the minimalism in the SWM practice at source. While S3 and S4 clearly show more optimization in sustainable waste management such as techincal efficiency, economic affordability and effective environment. The upgraded process of the SWM system is suggested to gradual apply from S0 to S3 and S4 under the monitoring of the government and the support from social organisations. It should be an oriented-plan of the SWM system in HAC toward sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","city; developing countries; solid waste management; sustainable waste management; tourism destination","","","","The authors special thanks to The People Committee of Hoi An City for their support and Okayama University for financial assistance.","Cencic, Oliver, Nonlinear data reconciliation in material flow analysis with software STAN, Sustainable Environment Research, 26, 6, pp. 291-298, (2016); Chen, M.

The study focuses on generating a set of criteria considering three dimensions of flood vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (AC) on an index-based approach. These indicators were decided based on a robust analysis considering the physical and socio-economic conditions of the study area. The flood exposure was generated from the geomorphological and hydrological parameters integrated with the flood water depth, the distance to river channels, and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index. The flood sensitivity was determined by the aggregation of local income, land use, poverty index, population density, and other parameters reflecting the socio-economic condition. The AC has been evaluated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the density of the community service facilities, and other factors related to the coping capacity to flood. Finally, the flood vulnerability at the local scale was determined based on the integration of its contributing factors using the Analytical Hierarchical Process-based aggregated model. Results indicated that a total of 20 parameters impacted the flood vulnerability of the research area. The findings also confirmed that among the indicators of flood vulnerability of Da Nang City, the flood depth, land-use condition, and drainage system are the key factors affecting the vulnerability level. The empirical assessment showed that the study area is significantly affected by flood vulnerability with more than 60% of the area having the vulnerability level from moderate to very high. In addition, this paper points out that the vulnerability research should be localized and is not always based on the administrative units. This practice can make the decision-making process and adaptation plan more appropriate locally. Especially, this study attempted to evaluate the accuracy of the flood vulnerability map for the first time by using field survey data and the statistical report on flood damage that most of the previous studies have not conducted yet. This framework provides a valuable toolkit for flood management in data-scarce regions all over the world. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adaptive capacity; Da Nang City; exposure; flood vulnerability; sensitivity","Decision making; Flood control; Geographic information systems; Land use; Open systems; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Adaptive capacity; Da nang city; Exposure; Flood vulnerabilities; Geographical information; Local scale; Sensitivity; Socio-economic conditions; Study areas; Vulnerability assessments; Floods; adaptive management; analytical hierarchy process; disaster management; field survey; flood damage; GIS; NDVI; remote sensing; sensitivity analysis; vulnerability; Da Nang; Viet Nam","","","This work was supported by the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) under the project no.

Results showed that the mangrove area in the study area decreased from 2960 ha in 1990 to 2408 ha in 1995 and then significantly increased to 4435 ha in 2000 but later declined to 3502 ha in 2005. The mangrove areas experienced an increase from 4706 ha in 2010 to 10,125 ha in 2020 and reached a highest peak of 10,630 ha in 2022. In 2022, Hai Phong province had the largest area of mangrove (3934 ha), followed by Nam Dinh (3501 ha) and Thai Binh (3195 ha) provinces. The overall accuracies for 2020 and 2022 were 94.94% and 91.98%, while the Kappa coefficients were 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. The mangrove restoration programs and policies by the Vietnamese government and local governments are the key drivers of this increase in mangroves in the three provinces from 1990 to 2022. The results also demonstrated that the combination of Landsat time series images, a pixel-based algorithm, and the GEE platform has a high potential for monitoring long-term change of mangrove forests during 32 years in the tropics. Moreover, the obtained mangrove forest maps at a 30-m spatial resolution can serve as a useful and up-to-date dataset for sustainable management and conservation of these mangrove forests in the Red River Delta, Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Google Earth Engine; Landsat; mangrove; Red River Delta; remote sensing; Vietnam","Engines; Forestry; Pixels; Remote sensing; Time series; Google earth engine; Google earths; LANDSAT; Landsat time series; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; Red River delta; Remote-sensing; Time-series data; Viet Nam; Landsat","","","The authors are thankful to the JICE (Japanese International Cooperation Center) for financial support to the first author studying a master course at the University of Tsukuba, Japan for 2 years.

During the COVID-19 pandemic waves, antibiotic use increases remarkably in treating bacterial coinfections. Antibiotics were initially expected only to affect prokaryotes, but recent research has shown that they can disturb the biological systems of eukaryotes, especially vulnerable aquatic creatures, through both direct and indirect processes. However, their toxicity to the freshwater cladoceran Simocephalus vetulus, an essential link in the aquatic food web, has never been evaluated. The effects of four fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin: CFX, ofloxacin: OFX, gatifloxacin: GFX, delafloxacin: DFX), tetracycline (TET), and a mixture of these medicines (MIX) on S. vetulus thoracic limb rate (TLR) were examined in this study. After S. vetulus was exposed to 20 and 40 mg GFX L−1, 90% and 100% mortality rates were recorded. At 2.5–10 mg L−1, GFX dramatically lowered the TLR of S. vetulus, resulting in a median effective concentration of 9.69 mg L−1. TLRs increased when the organisms were exposed to 10–40 mg L−1 of CFX and 1.25–40 mg L−1 of OFX. However, DFX and TET exposures did not affect TLRs. Exposure to MIX reduced TLR only at 40 mg L−1, suggesting an antagonistic interaction among the five pharmaceuticals. This study demonstrated that S. vetulus physiological responses to antibiotics, even in the same class, are complex and elusive. Beyond a common additive concentration principle, the antagonistic interaction of antibiotic mixture indicates a high level of uncertainty in terms of ecological dangers. We initially introduce S. vetulus to ecotoxicological studies of antibiotics, presenting the species as a low-cost model for physiological investigations of environmental xenobiotics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antagonism; Antibiotic mixture; Fluoroquinolones; Simocephalus vetulus; Tetracycline; Thoracic limb rate","Antibiotics; Biochemistry; Ecology; Physiological models; Physiology; Antagonism; Antagonistic interactions; Antibiotic mixture; Exposed to; Fluoroquinolones; Human health; Physiological response; Simocephalus vetulu; Tetracycline; Thoracic limb rate; Mixtures; antibiotic agent; ciprofloxacin; delafloxacin; gatifloxacin; ofloxacin; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; tetracycline; tetracycline derivative; antiinfective agent; xenobiotic agent; antibiotics; COVID-19; epidemic; physiological response; pollution exposure; xenobiotics; animal experiment; Article; Cladocera; controlled study; degradation; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; food web; mortality rate; nonhuman; short term exposure; Simocephalus vetulus; thoracic limb; animal; ecosystem; human; pandemic; physiology; toxicity; water pollutant; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ecosystem; Humans; Pandemics; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Xenobiotics","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1, 86393-32-0, 128074-72-6, 128074-76-0, 192934-52-4, 93107-08-5, 86483-48-9, 96186-80-0; delafloxacin, 189279-58-1, 352458-37-8; gatifloxacin, 112811-59-3, 180200-66-2; ofloxacin, 82419-36-1; tetracycline, 23843-90-5, 60-54-8, 64-75-5, 8021-86-1; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Xenobiotics","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number: 20K20640 ), Japan, and Nagasaki University WISE Programme Research, Japan.","Bownik, Adam, Protective effects of ectoine on heat-stressed Daphnia magna, Journal of Comparative Physiology B: Biochemical, Systemic, and Environmental Physiology, 184, 8, pp. 961-976, (2014); Aderemi, Adeolu O., Oxidative stress responses and cellular energy allocation changes in microalgae following exposure to widely used human antibiotics, Aquatic Toxicology, 203, pp. 130-139, (2018); Akbar, Siddiq, Changes in the life history traits of Daphnia magna are associated with the gut microbiota composition shaped by diet and antibiotics, Science of the Total Environment, 705, (2020); Amarasiri, Mohan, Understanding human health risks caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in water environments: Current knowledge and questions to be answered, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 50, 19, pp. 2016-2059, (2020); Arias, Marina, Sublethal effects on Simocephalus vetulus (Cladocera: Daphnidae) of pulse exposures of cypermethrin, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 196, (2020); Evol Appl, (2008); Bollenbach, Tobias, Antimicrobial interactions: Mechanisms and implications for drug discovery and resistance evolution, Current Opinion in Microbiology, 27, pp. 1-9, (2015); Bownik, Adam, Physiological endpoints in daphnid acute toxicity tests, Science of the Total Environment, 700, (2020); Bownik, Adam, Early indicators of behavioral and physiological disturbances in Daphnia magna (Cladocera) induced by cyanobacterial neurotoxin anatoxin-a, Science of the Total Environment, 695, (2019); Bownik, Adam, Procaine penicillin alters swimming behaviour and physiological parameters of Daphnia magna, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 26, 18, pp. 18662-18673, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00489697; 18791026","","STEVA","35306083","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126590917"

In preliminary experiment, doses of PF915275 (PF, 11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor) was exanimated. PF at a dose of 1000 nM (PF1000) decreased significantly the absolute conversion of Cs to Cr (p<0.05). Thus, the PF1000 was chosen for the further studies. Tissues of endometrium were collected at the follicular stage (days 19-21), and exposed to Cs (300 nM) or Cs (300 nM) combined with oxytocin (OT, 100 nM) in the presence or absence of PF1000 in 4 h. The PGE and PGF secretion in cultured endometrial tissue did not affected by Cs and Cr converted from Cs. PGE and PGF production regulated by OT was higher in the presence than in the absence of PF1000 indicating that PGE and PGF production stimulated by OT was suppressed by Cr converted from Cs.

Investigation was performed using a shadowgraph technique based on images recorded with a high-speed camera equipped with back-laser illumination. We observed that the droplet transfer frequency increased with both the welding current and flux ratio, with the effect of flux ratio being more dominant at low currents. We surmise that this is because the wire sheath area decreases as the flux ratio is increased. Hence, when the welding current is the same, a reduction in the sheath area (i.e., an increase in flux content) leads to an increase in the current density in the sheath, which enlarges the electromagnetic force at the tip of the wire and aids droplet detachment. Conversely, Joule heating is higher at high welding currents than at low currents. This increased temperature shortens the flux column inside the wire, such that the current flow into the molten droplets is more uniform. Hence, the droplet transfer frequency does not increase significantly if the flux ratio is increased in the high current range. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","current path; droplet transfer; flux ratio; metal-cored arc welding; metal-cored wire","","","","The authors are grateful for the support toward this study by a joint research agreement between the Joining and Welding Research Institute, Osaka University, Japan; Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam; Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan; Thai Kobelco Welding Co., Ltd., Thailand.","Kah, Paul, Usability of arc types in industrial welding, International Journal of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, 9, 1, (2014); Fan, Honggang, Droplet formation, detachment, and impingement on the molten pool in gas metal arc welding, Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B: Process Metallurgy and Materials Processing Science, 30, 4, pp. 791-801, (1999); Hu, Junling, Heat and mass transfer in gas metal arc welding.

Here, we assessed the applicability of gasification biochars from cedar wood (W) and rice husk (R) for the agricultural soil amendment and compared their ability in enhancing soybean yield in two consecutive cropping cycles. The pot experiment included four treatments: F0 (control 1), without both nitrogen fertilizer (N<inf>fer</inf>) and biochar, F (control 2), using only N<inf>fer</inf>, W–F, using W with N<inf>fer</inf>, and R–F, using R with N<inf>fer</inf>. Both gasification biochars had higher pH, CEC, and greater nitrogen retention than the soil. In the first cropping cycle, the W application showed an immense impact on some soil physical properties, including bulk density reduction (12%) and water-holding capacity increment (25%) while the R amendment significantly increased exchangeable K (45%) and soil pH. In addition, other changes in soil chemical due to W and R applications included enhancement of available phosphorus (P, 8–14%) and reduction of ammonium content (12–21%). After two consecutive cropping cycles, W–F indicated the largest content of soil available P and the highest soil pH. Ultimately, the co-application with N<inf>fer</inf> of W and R had the same significant impact on soybean yield compared with control 1 in the first and two consecutive cropping cycles.

Cytoglobin (CYGB), a globin family member expressed in HSCs, inhibits HSC activation and reduces collagen production. We studied the antifibrotic properties of globin family members hemoglobin (HB), myoglobin (MB), and neuroglobin (NGB) in comparison with CYGB. Approach & results: We characterized the biological activities of globins in cultured human HSCs (HHSteCs) and their effects on carbon tetrachloride (CCl<inf>4</inf>)-induced cirrhosis in mice. All globins demonstrated greater antioxidant capacity than glutathione in cell-free systems. Cellular fractionation revealed endocytosis of extracellular MB, NGB, and CYGB, but not HB; endocytosed globins localized to intracellular membranous, cytoplasmic, and cytoskeletal fractions. MB, NGB, and CYGB, but not HB, scavenged reactive oxygen species generated spontaneously or stimulated by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or transforming growth factor β1 in HHSteCs and reduced collagen 1A1 production via suppressing COL1A1 promoter activity. Disulfide bond-mutant NGB displayed decreased heme and superoxide scavenging activity and reduced collagen inhibitory capacity. RNA sequencing of MB- and NGB-treated HHSteCs revealed downregulation of extracellular matrix–encoding and fibrosis-related genes and HSC deactivation markers. Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 was observed following MB and NGB treatment, and MMP-1 knockdown partially reversed globin-mediated effects on secreted collagen. Importantly, administration of MB, NGB, and CYGB suppressed CCl<inf>4</inf>-induced mouse liver fibrosis. Conclusions: These findings revealed unexpected roles for MB and NGB in deactivating HSCs and inhibiting liver fibrosis development, suggesting that globin therapy may represent a new strategy for combating fibrotic liver disease. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-fibrotic therapy; Endocytosis; Globin; HSCs; ROS","ascorbic acid; carbon tetrachloride; collagen type I alpha 1 chain; cytoglobin; disulfide; glutathione; heme; hemoglobin; hydrogen peroxide; interstitial collagenase; myoglobin; neuroglobin; reactive oxygen metabolite; recombinant protein; superoxide; transforming growth factor beta1; globin; nerve protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antifibrotic activity; antioxidant activity; Article; carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis; carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis; cell culture; cell fractionation; cell free system; cell membrane; cellular distribution; collagen degradation; collagen synthesis; controlled study; cytoplasm; cytoskeleton; disulfide bond; down regulation; endocytosis; enzyme release; extracellular matrix; gene knockdown; hepatic stellate cell; human; human cell; IC50; liver fibrosis; liver protection; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein synthesis inhibition; RNA sequencing; upregulation; animal; genetics; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; Animals; Cytoglobin; Globins; Hemoglobins; Hydrogen Peroxide; Liver Cirrhosis; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Mice; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neuroglobin; Reactive Oxygen Species","","ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; carbon tetrachloride, 56-23-5; disulfide, 16734-12-6; glutathione, 70-18-8; heme, 14875-96-8; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; interstitial collagenase, 9001-12-1; superoxide, 11062-77-4; Cytoglobin; Globins; Hemoglobins; Hydrogen Peroxide; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neuroglobin; Reactive Oxygen Species","Funding text 1: V.N.H. was awarded the Japanese Government Scholarship for the Ph.D. course.

In this study, we investigated the anatomy of the feeding apparatus of two species, Parapocryptes serperaster and Pseudapocryptes elongatus, both of which can be regarded as representing early stages of the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial existence. The feeding system of these two species is morphologically similar: they both exhibit a unique orientation of premaxillary (vertical) and dentary (horizontal) teeth; a heterogeneous development of gill rakers among gill arches; strongly curved, large pharyngeal plates studded with numerous papilliform teeth; branchial basket skeletons with nearly equal gill-arch lengths; and a similar configuration of the branchial basket musculature. On the other hand, the number of teeth in Pa. serperaster is more than twice that in Pd. elongatus, both on the premaxillary and dentary bones, while the size of the teeth in Pa. serperaster is only half that in Pd. elongatus both in length and width. Pharyngeal plates and associated muscular and skeletal elements are more posteriorly positioned in Pd. elongatus. These similarities and differences may be explained by different trophic adaptations to herbivory and omnivory during the early transitional stages to life on mudflats. The results are discussed in the context of the two phylogenetic hypotheses of the oxudercine gobies based on their ecology and morphology and on genetic analysis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feeding apparatus; Functional morphology; Oxudercine gobies; Parapocryptes serperaster; Pseudapocryptes elongatus","","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Ms. Mizuri Murata (Institute for East China Sea Research, Nagasaki University) and Dr. Hieu Van Mai (College of Aquaculture and Fisheries, Can Tho University) for their help during the field study; Dr. Nguyen Van Cong, the Dean of the College of Environment and Natural Resources, Can Tho University and Dr. Tran Dac Dinh, the College of Aquaculture and Fisheries, Can Tho University for arranging our trips to Mo O and providing preserved specimens for complementary observations; and a local fisherman for collecting samples.; Funding text 2: This study was partly supported by Keidanren Nature Conservation Fund “Conservation and cleaning up of MoO mudflat, Mekong river-mouth”.","International Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Studies, (2015); Agorreta, Ainhoa, Molecular phylogenetics of Gobioidei and phylogenetic placement of European gobies, Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 69, 3, pp. 619-633, (2013); Bucholtz, Rikke Hagstrøm, Biological observations on the mudskipper Pseudapocryptes elongatus in the mekong delta, Vietnam, Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 40, 6, pp. 711-723, (2009); University of Hong Kong, (1989); Chaudhuri, Atreyee, Food partitioning among carnivores within feeding guild structure of fishes inhabiting a mudflat ecosystem of Indian Sundarbans, Aquatic Ecology, 48, 1, pp. 35-51, (2014); Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev, (1993); Clayton, David A., Feeding behavior: A review, pp. 237-276, (2017); Dinh, Quang Minh, Burrow morphology and utilization of the goby (Parapocryptes serperaster) in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, Ichthyological Research, 61, 4, pp. 332-340, (2014); Dinh, Quang Minh, Seasonal variation of food and feeding in burrowing goby Parapocryptes serperaster (Gobiidae) at different body sizes, Ichthyological Research, 64, 2, pp. 179-189, (2017); Science Bulletin of the Faculty of Agriculture Kyushu University, (1957)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","0720213X; 1432234X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125937153"

The performance and accuracy of each ML model were assessed and compared with the stage-discharge rating curves (RCs) using four statistical indicators, Taylor diagrams, violin plots, scatter plots, time-series plots, and heatmaps. Model input selection was performed using mutual information and correlation coefficient methods after three data pre-processing steps: normalization, Fourier series fitting, and first-order differencing. The results showed that the ML models are superior to their RC counterparts, and MARS and RF are the most reliable algorithms, although MARS achieves marginally better performance than RF. Compared to RC, MARS and RF reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) by 135% and 141% and the mean absolute error by 194% and 179%, respectively, using year-round data. However, the performance of MARS and RF developed for the climbing (wet season) and recession (dry season) limbs separately worsened slightly compared to that developed using the year-round data. Specifically, the RMSE of MARS and RF in the falling limb was 856 and 1,040 m3/s, respectively, while that obtained using the year-round data was 768 and 789 m3/s, respectively. In this study, the DT model is not recommended, while the GPR and SVR models provide acceptable results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","discharge reconstruction; machine learning; MARS; random forest; Vietnamese Mekong Delta","Correlation methods; Data handling; Fourier series; Mean square error; Support vector regression; Discharge reconstruction; Gaussian process regression; Machine learning models; Mekong Delta; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Performance; Random forests; Rating curve; Vietnamese; Vietnamese mekong delta; Decision trees; ground penetrating radar; machine learning; river discharge; support vector machine","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the Mekong River Commission and the Vietnam National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting for providing the data.

We find that the mechanical anisotropy of γ-GeS is higher than those of γ-GeSe and γ-GeTe, because of its strongest ionic bond. In the unstrained case, γ-GeX is an indirect-gap semiconductor with the Mexican-hat (MH) dispersion in the valence band. By applying tensile and biaxial strains, both energy band gap and valley positions are controlled. On the other hand, by applying an external electric field, the energy band gap is decreased to zero because of the downward interlayer band. We also find that the in-plane optical absorptions of monolayer γ-GeX in the visible-light region are comparable to that of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS<inf>2</inf>. Due to the unique structure in the z direction, the monolayer γ-GeX also shows a high value of the out-of-plane optical absorptions. The strain engineering significantly modifies the optical absorption in the visible light, while the effect of the external electric field on the optical properties is weak. Our results will be helpful to design the electro-optical devices based on monolayer materials with MH band. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy band gap; External electric field; Mexican-hat band; Optical absorption; Strain engineering; γ-GeX","Density functional theory; Electric fields; Energy gap; Germanium compounds; Layered semiconductors; Light; Light absorption; Molybdenum compounds; Optical properties; Strain; Transition metals; Density-functional theory calculations; Effects of strains; Electronic and optical properties; Energy bandgaps; External electric field; Mechanical anisotropy; Mexican-hat band; Strain engineering; Structure-based; Γ-GeX; Monolayers","","","N.T.H. acknowledges JSPS KAKENHI (No. JP20K15178), FRIS Creative Interdisciplinary Collaboration Program in Tohoku University, and the financial support from Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences in Tohoku University, Japan.","undefined, (2014); Zólyomi, Viktor, Band structure and optical transitions in atomic layers of hexagonal gallium chalcogenides, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 87, 19, (2013); Magnetisms in P Type Monolayer Gallium Chalcogenides Gase Gas, (2014); Stauber, Tobias, Fermi liquid theory of a Fermi ring, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 75, 11, (2007); Min, Hongki, Ab initio theory of gate induced gaps in graphene bilayers, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 75, 15, (2007); Hu, Pingan, Highly responsive ultrathin GaS nanosheet photodetectors on rigid and flexible substrates, Nano Letters, 13, 4, pp. 1649-1654, (2013); Zhuang, Houlong, Single-layer group-III monochalcogenide photocatalysts for water splitting, Chemistry of Materials, 25, 15, pp. 3232-3238, (2013); Zólyomi, Viktor, Electrons and phonons in single layers of hexagonal indium chalcogenides from ab initio calculations, Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 89, 20, (2014); Bandurin, Denis A., High electron mobility, quantum Hall effect and anomalous optical response in atomically thin InSe, Nature Nanotechnology, 12, 3, pp. 223-227, (2017); Ren, Chongdan, First-principles investigation on electronic properties and band alignment of group III monochalcogenides, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01694332","0873392558","ASUSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122832894"

Thus, a further understanding of consumer behaviour and loyalty towards such food is essential for food retailers. This study aims at exploring segments of consumer loyalty and its influential factors towards safe food brands in the country. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 250 consumers buying safe food in Hanoi city in February 2019, two-step cluster and multinomial logistic regression analyses were applied. Findings: The results show that four segments of brand loyalty were formed from the interaction between attitudinal and behavioural loyalty as the framework of Dick and Basu (1994), namely, true loyalty, spurious loyalty, latent loyalty and disloyalty. Notably, over 60% of the consumers were in latent loyalty and spurious loyalty, indicating variety-seeking behaviour, multi-brand loyalty or low recognition of the brand. Consumer satisfaction was the most vital motivating consumers to higher loyalty levels. Additionally, brand trust and brand familiarity played significant roles in developing true brand loyalty. An attractive selling store and friendly staff were also important in enhancing brand loyalty. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to elicit consumer loyalty and identify factors driving the loyalty towards brands of safe food in a developing country like Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand loyalty; Brands; Consumer loyalty; Safe food; Safe vegetables; Vietnam","","","","This study was partially funded by the QR programme, Kyushu University, Japan.

In this study, the 89.5 fb-1 of hadronic e+e-annihilation data collected by the Belle detector at KEKB are used. Two-particle angular correlation functions are measured in the full relative azimuthal angle (Δφ) and three units of pseudorapidity (Δη), defined by either the electron beam axis or the event-shape thrust axis, and are studied as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. The measurement in the thrust axis analysis, with mostly outgoing quark pairs determining the reference axis, is sensitive to the region of additional soft gluon emissions. No significant anisotropic collective behavior is observed with either coordinate analyses. Near-side jet correlations appear to be absent in the thrust axis analysis. The measurements are compared to predictions from various event generators and are expected to provide new constraints to the phenomenological models in the low-energy regime. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Charged particles; Angular correlations; Azimuthal angle; Belle detectors; Correlation function; Hadronics; High multiplicity; Measurements of; Thrust axis; Two particles; Two-particle correlations; Germanium compounds; article; correlation function; destruction; electron beam; gluon; hadron; prediction; quark","","","We thank the KEKB group for the excellent operation of the accelerator; the KEK cryogenics group for the efficient operation of the solenoid; and the KEK computer group, and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) computing group for strong computing support; and the National Institute of Informatics, and Science Information NETwork 5 (SINET5) for valuable network support.

However, sand mining budgets remain limited to rough and indirect estimates. Here, we provide a first systematic, field-based estimation of the Mekong Delta's sand mining budget. This budget overcomes the limitations of relying on officially declared statistics and bathymetric surveys of short channel reaches. We applied Sentinel-1 radar imagery to monitor the distribution of sand mining activities using boat metrics-driven mining intensity maps correlated with a field-based bathymetry difference map which were derived from two extensive bathymetric surveys conducted in 2014 and 2017. The two surveys cover ∼ 100 km in the Tiền River, reaching approximately 15% of the Mekong Delta. We then extrapolated the Tiền River findings to the broader Vietnamese Mekong Delta from 2015 to 2020 and measured a continuous increase of the extraction budget by ∼ 25% between 2015 (38 Mm3/yr) and 2020 (47 Mm3/yr). We estimated a total sand mining budget of 254 Mm3 during the 6-year study period with an average annual rate of ∼ 42 Mm3. Our field-based annual rates are higher than both official declarations provided and estimates from previous studies which implies that a substantial portion of the sand mining budget remains unaccounted for. Riverbed sand mining remains a key threat to the Mekong Delta as it contributes to a multitude of other environmental threats including dam construction effects on sedimentation, ongoing subsidence, sea level rise and recurring saltwater intrusion. This study offers a new approach that can be implemented elsewhere to allow for systematic monitoring and quantification of sand mining activities that are vital for assessing future projections on environmental impacts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mekong Delta; Remote sensing; Riverbed incision; Sand mining; Sustainability","bathymetric survey; mining; radar imagery; remote sensing; river bed; sand; Sentinel; sustainability; trend analysis; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: This study is funded by Nanyang Technological University (#SUG-NAP 3/19EP) and Ministry of Education of Singapore (#Tier1 RT06/19, #Tier1 2021-T1-001-056 and #Tier2 MOE-T2EP402A20-0001).

In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of the operculate land snail genus Cyclophorus (Caenogastropoda: Cyclophoridae) in the Ryukyu Archipelago and surrounding regions based on DNA sequence data. According to our results, all studied Cyclophorus specimens from Japan form a monophyletic group containing eight subclades. Six of these subclades were found only on the Ryukyu Islands. On most islands of the Ryukyu Archipelago, no more than one Cyclophorus subclade was recorded, which may be due to limited ecological niche space and competition. No subclade was found to occur on both sides of the Watase Line, a regional zoogeographical boundary. Divergence times were estimated based on a time-calibrated phylogeny. We found that multiple splits among the Japanese Cyclophorus subclades predate the emergence of major sea barriers in the Ryukyu Archipelago. Vicariance due to sea barrier formation, as assumed for many other taxa from the region, was thus likely not the main driver for subclade divergence in these snails. Instead, certain geographical features might have shaped the diversification of subclades prior to sea barrier formation. Given that Cyclophorus populations were also present on islands that have never been connected to other land masses, the snails must have colonized them via oversea dispersal. As not all nominal taxa corresponded to monophyletic groups, our molecular phylogenetic approach revealed that a taxonomic revision of the Japanese Cyclophorus fauna is necessary. The eight subclades may be regarded as potential species-level groups based on COI p-distances. A canonical discriminant analysis using shell morphological data revealed slight differences among the subclades. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Biogeography; Cyclophoroidea; East Asia; Molecular phylogenetics; Morphology","animal; Japan; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; snail; Animals; Base Sequence; Phylogeny; Snails","","","We thank T.

This study aims to investigate the plugging performance of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media through a series of sandpack experiments. First of all, CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluids were generated by stirring CO<inf>2</inf> gas diffused into polymer (Xanthan gum (XG)) and surfactant (Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) solution with different gas: liquid ratios. Then, CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles fluids were injected into single-core and dual-core sandpack systems. The results show that the rheological behaviors of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluids in this study were followed the Power-law model at room temperature. The apparent viscosity of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid increased as the gas: liquid ratio increased. CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles could block pore throat due to the “Jamin effect” and increase the resistance in porous media. The blocking ability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles reached an optimal value at the gas:liquid ratio of 20% in the homogeneous porous media. Moreover, the selective pugging ability of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in dual-core sandpack tests was significant. CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles exhibited a good flow control profile in the high permeability region and flexibility to flow over the pore constrictions in the low permeability region, leading to an ultimate fractional flow proportion (50%:50%) in the dual-core sandpack model with a permeability differential of 1.0:2.0 darcy. The fractional flow ratio was considerable compared with a polymer injection. At the higher heterogeneity of porous media (0.5:2.0 darcy), CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid could still establish a good swept performance. This makes CO<inf>2</inf> microbubble fluid injection a promising candidate for heterogeneous reservoirs where conventional CO<inf>2</inf> flooding processes have limited ability. This finding would be helpful in developing the utilization of CO<inf>2</inf> microbubbles in EOR operation by better understanding their plugging mechanism in porous media. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CO2 microbubbles; CO2-Enhanced oil recovery; Dual-core sandpack model; Heterogeneous porous media; Plugging ability; Single-core sandpack model","Enhanced recovery; Flow of fluids; Gases; Liquids; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Porous materials; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Sulfur compounds; CO2 microbubble; CO2-enhanced oil recovery; Dual-core; Dual-core sandpack model; Enhanced-oil recoveries; Heterogeneous porous media; Microbubble fluids; Microbubbles; Plugging ability; Single-core sandpack model; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; enhanced oil recovery; hydrocarbon reservoir; permeability; polymer; porous medium; surfactant; viscosity","","","We would like to thank the support of time and facilities for this study from Kyushu University, Japan, and Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), VNU-HCM, Vietnam.","Alizadeh, Ali, Mathematical modeling of the Colloidal Gas Aphron transport through porous medium using the filtration theory, Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 44, pp. 37-53, (2017); Alizadeh, Ali, Modeling of micro-bubble surfactant multi-layer drilling fluid stability based on single bubble behavior under pressure and temperature in a deviated gas well, Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 26, pp. 42-50, (2015); Arabloo, Milad, Experimental studies on stability and viscoplastic modeling of colloidal gas aphron (CGA) based drilling fluids, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 113, pp. 8-22, (2014); Bachu, Stefan, Identification of oil reservoirs suitable for CO2-EOR and CO2 storage (CCUS) using reserves databases, with application to Alberta, Canada, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 44, pp. 152-165, (2016); Bjorndalen, H.

This study was conducted during 2016 to 2019 at Ngoc Lam Commune, Thanh Chuong District, Nghe An Province, Vietnam on the effect of forest reclamation methods (FRMs), including the slash-and-burn method (SBM), the clear-cutting method (CCM), and agricultural cultivation methods on the interaction of soil physicochemical properties across the study area. To conduct this study, soil samples were collected in natural forest areas in the study area. The results indicated that the bulk density (BD) of the natural forest soils across the study area ranged from 0.86 to 1.12 g/cm3 at depths varying from 0 to 60 cm from the surface. The concentrations of total carbon (T-C), exchangeable potassium (Exch. K+), and exchangeable magnesium (Exch. Mg2+) in the deeper layer were normally lower than in the upper layer. Forest reclamation using the CCM influenced the increase of the BD at depths varying from 0-20 cm, but the soil texture remained same, while forest reclamation applying the CCM showed an increase in the BD in the plots depending on the land-use management (LUM). Based on these findings, LUM has a significant influence on the concentration of Exch. Ca2+, Exch. K+, Exch.

There is little information on population immunity against diphtheria in countries without a school-entry booster dose. We aimed to measure the age-stratified seroprevalence of anti-diphtheria toxoid antibodies, quantify the change in antibody levels in individuals over time, and estimate the length of protective immunity after vaccination in well-vaccinated communities in Vietnam. Methods: An age-stratified seroprevalence survey among individuals aged 0-55 years was conducted at Nha Trang, Vietnam. The same participants were followed up after two years to quantify the change in antibody levels. IgG was measured using ELISA. The length of protective immunity after vaccination was estimated using a mixed-effect linear regression model with random intercept. Results: Overall seroprevalence was 26% (95%CI:20-32%). Age-stratified seroprevalence was 68% (95%CI:4-11%), 7% (95%CI:4-11%), 12% (95%CI:7-19%), 33% (95%CI:27-40%), and 28% (95%CI:17-43%) among those aged ≤5, 6-15,16-25, 26-35, and 36-55 years, respectively. The antibody levels declined by 47% (95%CI:31-59%) over two years, and the predicted duration of vaccine-derived protective immunity after receiving four doses was 4.3 years (95%CI:3.5–5.3) among participants aged six years or younger. Conclusion: Given the low seroprevalence and short period of vaccine protection, a school-entry booster dose (5-7 years) is recommended in Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","diphtheria; DTP; immunity; schedule; vaccine; Vietnam","diphtheria antibody; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; diphtheria vaccine; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin G1; immunoglobulin G1 antibody; bacterium antibody; diphtheria toxoid; adolescent; adult; antibody blood level; antibody response; Article; child; controlled study; diphtheria; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; groups by age; human; human experiment; infant; male; newborn; pertussis; population size; seroprevalence; tetanus; vaccination; vaccination coverage; Viet Nam; middle aged; preschool child; seroepidemiology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Antibodies, Bacterial; Child; Child, Preschool; Diphtheria; Diphtheria Toxoid; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Middle Aged; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Vietnam; Young Adult","","immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; Antibodies, Bacterial; Diphtheria Toxoid; Immunoglobulin G","Funding text 1: We would like to acknowledge Mr. The Tran Minh, the late former head of the Department of Bacteriology in the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang, for his contribution to this research as well as all the participants and the survey teams in Khanh Hoa Province Health Services and health centers.

We studied the effect of CD109 knockout (KO) or knockdown (KD) on TF-1, a myeloid leukemia cell line that expresses CD109, and primary human HSPCs. CD109-KO or KD TF-1 cells underwent erythroid differentiation in the presence of TGF-β. CD109 was more abundantly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) than in multipotent progenitors and HSPCs of human bone marrow (BM) and cord blood but was not detected in mouse HSCs. Erythroid differentiation was induced by TGF-β to a greater extent in CD109-KD cord blood or iPS cell-derived megakaryocyte–erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEPs) than in wild-type MEPs. When we analyzed the phenotype of peripheral blood MEPs of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who had both GPI(+) and GPI(−) CD34+ cells, the CD36 expression was more evident in CD109− MEPs than CD109+ MEPs. In summary, CD109 suppresses TGF-β signaling in HSPCs, and the lack of CD109 may increase the sensitivity of PIGA-mutated HSPCs to TGF-β, thus leading to the preferential commitment of erythroid progenitor cells to mature red blood cells in immune-mediated BM failure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","CD109 protein; CD34 antigen; CD36 antigen; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; CD109 protein, human; leukocyte antigen; tumor protein; animal cell; Article; bone marrow cell; cell differentiation; cell protection; clinical article; controlled study; erythroid cell; gene knockdown; gene knockout; hematopoietic stem cell; human; human cell; keratinocyte; megakaryocyte erythroid progenitor; mouse; nonhuman; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; phenotype; protein expression; protein function; TF-1 cell line; TGF beta signaling; umbilical cord blood cell; wild type; cell culture; cell line; cytology; erythropoiesis; hematopoiesis; metabolism; Antigens, CD; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Erythroid Cells; Erythropoiesis; GPI-Linked Proteins; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Neoplasm Proteins; Transforming Growth Factor beta","","Antigens, CD; CD109 protein, human; GPI-Linked Proteins; Neoplasm Proteins; Transforming Growth Factor beta","This work was supported by MEXT KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), Grant Number: 24390243) to SN, MEXT KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B), Grant Number: 26860363) to TK, MEXT KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists, Grant Number: 17K16184 and 19K17823) to KH, MEXT KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), Grant Number: 18K08318) to HY.

The Massive technology adoption program (AMTEC) is an example of Colombian rice production. Although all components of AMTEC have been approved to improve the rice yield in demo farms, these impacts, along with other factors under actual farm conditions, are unclear. Data were obtained from the 2016 National Rice Census data of 20,174 rice production units. This study determines the effects of each AMTEC technology and other agricultural factors on paddy rice yield under actual farm conditions using the multiple regression analysis with a backward stepwise method. The average paddy rice yield was 5.508 t ha−1 with a considerable variation across the whole country (0.110–12.187 t ha−1). The results showed that 69.47% of the variation in paddy rice yield was influenced by rice cultivation regions, farm size, technical assistance, applying chisel plow, having a ban, having an irrigation system, and the number of nitrogen fertilizer applications. Landplane, certified seeds, and drill sowing were the three components of the AMTEC program that contributed to an increase in rice yield. Notably, the paddy rice yield was 0.361 t ha−1 with an additional N fertilizer application or the farm under the irrigation system. It also increased from 0.404 to 0.362 t ha−1 for the farm that used drill sowing compared to the farm that used benchmark technologies. The results also showed that the farm that received technical assistance had a 0.150 t ha−1 compared to their counterparts who did not, and there was a significant difference among its sources. Therefore, to improve the rice yield, the above-mentioned multiple technologies should be widely disseminated. Additionally, the farms should receive technical assistance, particularly from private companies such as supply distributors or milling companies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AMTEC; Colombia; Farmers’ Adoption; Rice yield determinant","","","","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grand-in-Aid for Scientific Research?KAKENHI (JSPS KAKENHI) in 2019.

The SI disaster of 2020 is recognized as the worst in recent decades, hence inspiring this perspective article. The authors’ viewpoints on the disaster’s impacts and causes are presented. The arguments presented are mainly drawn from (i) up-to-date publications that report on the recent SI intensification in the VMD and (ii) the power spectral analysis results using water level data. We verified the intensifying SI in the VMD both in its frequency and magnitude and remarked on four of the key SI drivers: (i) upstream hydropower dams, (ii) land subsidence, (iii) the relative sea-level rise, and (iv) riverbed sand mining. Also, a non-exhaustive yet list of recommendable management implications to mitigate the negative effects of the SI is contributed. The mitigation measures must be realized at multiple scales, ranging from pursuing transboundary water diplomacy efforts to managing internal pressures via developing early warnings, restricting illegal sand mining activities, alleviating pressures on groundwater resources, and diversifying agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mekong delta; Riverbed incision; Salinity intrusion; Sea-level rise; Upstream dams","disaster management; environmental impact; groundwater resource; management practice; saline intrusion; spectral analysis; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; ground water; salt water; agriculture; disaster; salinity; Agriculture; Disasters; Groundwater; Saline Waters; Salinity","","","This research is funded by SUG-NAP (3/19) of the National Institute of Education at Nanyang Technological University, AcRF Tier1 RT 06/19 of the Ministry of Education (MoE) of Singapore, Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), and the Supporting Program for Interaction-Based Initiative Team Studies SPIRITS 2016 of Kyoto University.","Apel, Heiko, Brief communication: Seasonal prediction of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 20, 6, pp. 1609-1616, (2020); Arias, Mauricio E., Maintaining perspective of ongoing environmental change in the Mekong floodplains, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 37, pp. 1-7, (2019); Binh, Doan Van, Changes to long-term discharge and sediment loads in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta caused by upstream dams, Geomorphology, 353, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, Long-term alterations of flow regimes of the Mekong River and adaptation strategies for the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 32, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, A novel method for river bank detection from landsat satellite data: A case study in the Vietnamese Mekong delta, Remote Sensing, 12, 20, pp. 1-20, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, Riverbed incision in the Vietnamese mekong delta due to altered flow regime and sediment load, (2020); Binh, Doan Van, Effects of riverbed incision on the hydrology of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Hydrological Processes, 35, 2, (2021); Echogeo, (2013); Brunier, Guillaume, Recent morphological changes in the Mekong and Bassac river channels, Mekong delta: The marked impact of river-bed mining and implications for delta destabilisation, Geomorphology, 224, pp. 177-191, (2014); Rapid Assessment of the Extent and Impact of Sea Level Rise in Viet Nam, (2008)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","16547209; 00447447","","AMBOC","34115345","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107807283"

The production of ϒ(1S) mesons is tagged by ϒ(2S)→π+π-ϒ(1S) transitions, using 158×106 ϒ(2S) events accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy electron-positron collider. No significant A0 signals in the mass range from the τ+τ- or μ+μ- threshold to 9.2 GeV/c2 are observed. We set the upper limits at 90% credibility level (C.L.) on the product branching fractions for ϒ(1S)→γA0 and A0→τ+τ- varying from 3.8×10-6 to 1.5×10-4. Our results represent an approximately twofold improvement on the current world best upper limits for the ϒ(1S)→γA0(→τ+τ-) production. For A0→μ+μ-, the upper limits on the product branching fractions for ϒ(1S)→γA0 and A0→μ+μ- are at the same level as the world average limits, and vary from 3.1×10-7 to 1.6×10-5. The upper limits at 90% credibility level on the Yukawa coupling fϒ(1S) and mixing angle sinθA0 are also given. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Particle beams; Asymmetric energy; Belle detectors; Branching fractions; Electron-positron colliders; Higgs boson; Photon decay; Product branching; Radiative decay; Single photons; Upper limits; Bosons","","","We thank the KEKB group for the excellent operation of the accelerator; the KEK cryogenics group for the efficient operation of the solenoid; and the KEK computer group, and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) computing group for strong computing support; and the National Institute of Informatics, and Science Information NETwork 5 (SINET5) for valuable network support.

However, miniature featherwing beetles can fly at speeds and accelerations of insects three times their size2. Here we show that this performance results from a reduced wing mass and a previously unknown type of wing-motion cycle. Our experiment combines three-dimensional reconstructions of morphology and kinematics in one of the smallest insects, the beetle Paratuposa placentis (body length 395 μm). The flapping bristled wings follow a pronounced figure-of-eight loop that consists of subperpendicular up and down strokes followed by claps at stroke reversals above and below the body. The elytra act as inertial brakes that prevent excessive body oscillation. Computational analyses suggest functional decomposition of the wingbeat cycle into two power half strokes, which produce a large upward force, and two down-dragging recovery half strokes. In contrast to heavier membranous wings, the motion of bristled wings of the same size requires little inertial power. Muscle mechanical power requirements thus remain positive throughout the wingbeat cycle, making elastic energy storage obsolete. These adaptations help to explain how extremely small insects have preserved good aerial performance during miniaturization, one of the factors of their evolutionary success. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","beetle; body size; decomposition; energy storage; experimental study; flight activity; kinematics; muscle; wing morphology; animal structures; Article; computer model; evolutionary adaptation; nonhuman; three-dimensional imaging; wing; anatomy and histology; animal; biomechanics; flying; physiology; ultrastructure; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Coleoptera; Flight, Animal; Wings, Animal","","","Funding text 1: A.A.P. thanks R.

Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation","A search for double-heavy tetraquark state candidates Xccs¯s¯ decaying to Ds+Ds+ and Ds∗+Ds∗+ is presented for the first time using the data samples of 102×106 ϒ(1S) and 158×106 ϒ(2S) events, and the data samples at s=10.52, 10.58, and 10.867 GeV corresponding to integrated luminosities of 89.5, 711.0, and 121.4 fb-1, respectively, accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy electron-positron collider.

The presence of these glands has been confirmed in only 6 of 22 hornet species (genus Vespa) and images of their fine structure have not been produced. Here; we characterize the external morphology associated with both glands for workers of nine Vespa species using scanning electron microscopy. All hornets had similar gland configurations; although gland-associated external features differed among species. Scaled for size, glands were equivalently sized for the giant hornets (V. mandarinia and V. soror) and their closest phylogenetic relatives (V. tropica and V. ducalis). Relative size of gland-associated structures was reduced by half for V. simillima; V. velutina; and V. affinis workers. The remaining species (V. crabro and V. analis) had intermediately sized features. Differences among species in external gland structure were best explained by selective pressures related to predatory behavior, rather than defense of nests against ants. However, a lack of information about how Vespa workers use their van der Vecht and Richards glands limits a comparative interpretation of the function of their external gland mor-phology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemical defense; Exocrine glands; Giant hornets; Group predation; Pheromone communication; Richards gland; Social insects; Social wasps; Van der Vecht gland; Vespinae","","","","Funding: Funding was provided by the National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration (to GWO, HRM, and LTPN: grant number 9338-13), a bilateral grant agreement between the Bulgarian Academy of Science and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (to LTPN: grant number QTBG01.01/21-22), the Asahi Glass Foundation (to SS), the Tokyo Metropolitan University Fund for TMU Strategic Research (SS collaborator and grant leader: Noriaki Murakami, FY2020–22), and Wellesley College (to HRM: Department of Biological Sciences, McNair Scholars Program, Provost’s Office).","Biology of the Vespine Wasps, (1990); Vespine Wasps of the World Behaviour Ecology Taxonomy of the Vespinae, (2012); Perrard, Adrien, Phylogeny of hornets: A total evidence approach (Hymenoptera, Vespidae, Vespinae, Vespa), Journal of Hymenoptera Research, 32, pp. 1-15, (2013); Perrard, Adrien, Phylogeny, landmark analysis and the use of wing venation to study the evolution of social wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Vespinae), Cladistics, 32, 4, pp. 406-425, (2016); Smith-Pardo, Allan Henry, The Diversity of Hornets in the Genus Vespa (Hymenoptera: Vespidae; Vespinae), Their Importance and Interceptions in the United States, Insect Systematics and Diversity, 4, 3, (2020); Social Biology of Wasps, (1991); Brodmann, Jennifer, Orchid Mimics Honey Bee Alarm Pheromone in Order to Attract Hornets for Pollination, Current Biology, 19, 16, pp. 1368-1372, (2009); Wei, Wei, Diversity, daily activity patterns, and pollination effectiveness of the insects visiting Camellia osmantha, C. vietnamensis, and C. oleifera in South China, Insects, 10, 4, (2019); Bulletin of the Faculty of Agriculture Mie University, (1984); J Fac Sci Hokkaido Univ, (1973)","","MDPI","","","","","","20797737","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124320434"

However, in poorly drained areas, such as the Red River Delta in Vietnam, the soil cannot be dried immediately, and so CH<inf>4</inf> can continue to be produced unintentionally. Therefore, the purpose of this case study was to identify the optimal ponding water management schedule to reduce CH<inf>4</inf> emissions by using the measured data of ponding depth, soil redox potential (Eh), and CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes from field experiments and to show its effects on CH<inf>4</inf> emission and water conservation. Observations in the winter–spring cropping season showed that the non-flooding period of 3–8 days suppressed CH<inf>4</inf> emission, and the continuous flooding period of 14–22 days caused CH<inf>4</inf> re-emission. Information regarding the non-flooding period to be maintained and the flooding period to be avoided to suppress CH<inf>4</inf> emission was not obtained for the summer–autumn cropping season due to abundant rainfall. The proposed schedule could suppress CH<inf>4</inf> emission by 27%–85% and increase the amount of conserved water by up to 18% compared with traditional flooding protocols, but it may increase irrigation water due to the frequency and the amount of re-flooding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","greenhouse gas; paddy irrigation; soil redox potential; Southeast Asia; water conservation","","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Vietnam (grant number NĐT.06.JPN/15), JSPS KAKENHI (grant numbers 16H05799 and 18H02297), and the “Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program)” from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.; Funding text 2: This study was conducted under a joint project between the Institute for Water and Environment under the Vietnam Academy for Water Resources in Vietnam and the Industrial-Academic Cooperative Research for Irrigation Water Management in Japan comprising Kitai Sekkei Co., Ltd. and Kyoto University.

In recent years, TMUV has become a concern due to the expansion of host species and increasing number of infection records in Asia. This study aimed to develop a sensitive and rapid reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method to target highly conserved regions using a colori fluorescent indicator (CFI) for TMUV detection. Two primer sets for RT-LAMP, including loop primers, were designed from the conserved region of the NS5 gene to accelerate amplification efficacy. The specificity and sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method were evaluated using the TMUV FX2010-180P vaccine strain and other duck-related viruses. RT-PCR and RT-LAMP concordance was evaluated based on results of 64 clinical samples. The developed RT-LAMP method was specific for TMUV. The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was 100 times higher than that of the two-step RT-PCR. The concordance between RT-PCR and RT-LAMP was 92.19%. A reliable, rapid, and simple RT-LAMP method for TMUV detection was successfully developed. This is the first RT-LAMP-based TMUV detection method with the addition of two loop primers for higher sensitivity and rapidity that could provide a potential strategy for screening TMUV infection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CFI; NS5 gene; RT-LAMP; RT-PCR; TMUV","","","","This research was partially supported by Japan-ASEAN Platform for Trans disciplinary Studies, CSEAS, Kyoto University.","Baltimore, David, Expression of animal virus genomes., Bacteriological Reviews, 35, 3, pp. 235-241, (1971); Chambers, Thomas J., Flavivirus genome organization, expression, and replication, Annual Review of Microbiology, 44, pp. 649-688, (1990); Dai, Li, Evolutionary analysis of Tembusu virus: Evidence for the emergence of a dominant genotype, Infection, Genetics and Evolution, 32, pp. 124-129, (2015); Journal of Veterinary Science Technology, (2020); Fu, Guanghua, Comparative analysis of transcriptional profiles of retinoic-acid-induced gene I-like receptors and interferons in seven tissues from ducks infected with avian Tembusu virus, Archives of Virology, 161, 1, pp. 11-18, (2016); Hayashida, Kyouko, Direct Blood Dry LAMP: A Rapid, Stable, and Easy Diagnostic Tool for Human African Trypanosomiasis, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 9, 3, (2015); Jiang, Tao, Development of RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR assays for the rapid detection of the new duck Tembusu-like BYD virus, Archives of Virology, 157, 12, pp. 2273-2280, (2012); Lei, Wenwen, The genetic characteristics and evolution of Tembusu virus, Veterinary Microbiology, 201, pp. 32-41, (2017); Liu, Ming, Adapted tembusu-like virus in chickens and geese in China, Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 50, 8, pp. 2807-2809, (2012); Liu, Peipei, Duck egg drop syndrome virus: An emerging Tembusu-related flavivirus in China, Science China Life Sciences, 56, 8, pp. 701-710, (2013)","","University of the Philippines at Los Banos","","","","","","2984763X; 00317705","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175100738"

Throughout the regime where the model yields a locally-finite graph, (i.e. for s > d,) we determine the spectral dimension of the associated simple random walk, apart from at the exceptional value d = 1, s = 2, where the spectral dimension is discontinuous. Towards this end, we present various on-diagonal heat kernel bounds, a number of which are new. In particular, the lower bounds are derived through the application of a general technique that utilises the translation invariance of the model. We highlight that, applying this general technique, we are able to partially extend our main result beyond the nearest-neighbour setting, and establish lower heat kernel bounds over the range of parameters s ∈ (d, 2d). We further note that our approach is applicable to short-range models as well. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","heat kernel estimates; long-range percolation; random walk; spectral dimension","","","","*This research was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI, grant numbers 17F17319, 17H01093 and 19K03540, by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 grant number MOE2018-T2-2-076, by the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology grant number CTTH00.02/22-23, and by the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, an International Joint Usage/Research Center located in Kyoto University. \u2020Institute of Mathematics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Cau Giay, Hanoi, Vietnam. \u2021Department of Statistics and Data Science, National University of Singapore, 6 Science Drive 2 Singapore 117546.

This study was designed to investigate the brain activity of a senior driver in response to simulated unexpected vehicle motion, compared with a relaxed state and normal driving. Methods: To accomplish this, we created a driving simulator paradigm wherein participants were involved in one of the following three scenarios: sitting down and relaxing, normal driving around the city with traffic signals and other vehicles, and the exiting of a parking area. In the scenario where the driver was to exit the parking area, the gear was switched automatically by the CarMaker software without the driver being notified, leading to an unexpected condition. The driver’s internal states were classified by artificial intelligence, based on information obtained through four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Significant differences were observed between the hemodynamic responses obtained in the three conditions. Ultimately, this method can be used to update advanced driver assistance systems, with a view to preventing future traffic accidents, by activating in-vehicle safety functions based on the driver’s condition. Conclusions: A driver’s internal states in a panic situation while driving can be detected using near-infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ADAS; machine learning; NIRS; Panic; unexpected conditions","artificial intelligence; car driving; human; motion; near infrared spectroscopy; prevention and control; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Artificial Intelligence; Automobile Driving; Humans; Motion; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","","","This study was partially supported by DENSO Corporation and by the Center of Innovation Program (Nagoya University COI: Mobility Innovation Center) from the Japan Science and Technology Agency.","Aghajani, Haleh, Measuring mental workload with EEG+fNIRS, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 11, (2017); undefined, (2010); Dong, Yanchao, Driver inattention monitoring system for intelligent vehicles: A review, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 12, 2, pp. 596-614, (2011); Engström, Johan A., Effects of visual and cognitive load in real and simulated motorway driving, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 8, 2 SPEC.

Taking the decay Ξc0→Ξ-π+ as the normalization mode, we measure the branching fraction ratio B(Ξc0→ΛKS0)/B(Ξc0→Ξ-π+)=0.229±0.008±0.012 with improved precision, and measure the branching fraction ratios B(Ξc0→Σ0KS0)/B(Ξc0→Ξ-π+)=0.038±0.006±0.004 and B(Ξc0→Σ+K-)/B(Ξc0→Ξ-π+)=0.123±0.007±0.010 for the first time. Taking into account the branching fraction of the normalization mode, the absolute branching fractions are determined to be B(Ξc0→ΛKS0)=(3.27±0.11±0.17±0.73)×10-3, B(Ξc0→Σ0KS0)=(0.54±0.09±0.06±0.12)×10-3, and B(Ξc0→Σ+K-)=(1.76±0.10±0.14±0.39)×10-3. The first and second uncertainties above are statistical and systematic, respectively, while the third ones arise from the uncertainty of the branching fraction of Ξc0→Ξ-π+. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We thank the KEKB group for the excellent operation of the accelerator; the KEK cryogenics group for the efficient operation of the solenoid; and the KEK computer group, and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) computing group for strong computing support; and the National Institute of Informatics, and Science Information NETwork 5 (SINET5) for valuable network support.

OBJECTIVE To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019. EVIDENCE REVIEW The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). FINDINGS In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7% (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this systematic analysis suggest that the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Article; breast cancer; bronchus cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cardiovascular disease; colorectal cancer; disability-adjusted life year; educational status; female; fertility rate; geographic distribution; global disease burden; human; income; liver cancer; lung cancer; male; non melanoma skin cancer; per capita income; population productivity; sociodemographics; stomach cancer; trachea cancer; years lived with disability; years of life lost; global health; incidence; neoplasm; prevalence; quality adjusted life year; risk factor; Disability-Adjusted Life Years; Global Burden of Disease; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Neoplasms; Prevalence; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Risk Factors","","","Funding text 1: The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities.

As a result, huge amounts of depleted uranium must be stockpiled and stored. Fast reactors operating in breed-and-burn (B&B) conditions are one potential approach to reducing the need for storage facilities to hold spent nuclear fuel and maximize the effective use of uranium resources. Sustaining B&B operating conditions depends on the choice of core materials. Here, we perform neutron balance analyses to determine the best combination of fuel and coolant material. We identify the features of the reactor core needed to maintain B&B operating mode by the amount of neutron loss from the core and coolant heat removal capability. Finally, we demonstrate that a large or small sodium-cooled fast reactor core with metallic or enriched nitride fuel, respectively, can sustain the chain reaction and B&B operation mode. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","B&B; Breed-and-burn reactor; core material combination; neutron balance","Coolants; Coremaking; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Sodium; Uranium; Breed and burns; Breed-and-burn reactor; Core material; Core material combination; Depleted uranium; Enriched uranium; Material combination; Neutron balance; Thermal reactors; Neutrons","","","This work was supported by the Tech World Research Hub Initiative (WRHI) Program of the Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and by the Foundation for Science and Technology of Mongolia under grant number 2018/45, and by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 103.04-2019.37.","Power Reactor Information System Pris, (2025); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, CANDLE: The new burnup strategy, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 139, 3, pp. 306-317, (2001); Arwif 2001, (2001); Light A Candle, (2010); Sekimoto, Hiroshi, Application of CANDLE burnup strategy for future nuclear energy utilization, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 47, 1-4, pp. 91-98, (2005); Hejzlar, Pavel, Terrapower, LLC traveling wave reactor development program overview, Nuclear Engineering and Technology, 45, 6, pp. 731-744, (2013); Ellis, Tyler, Traveling-wave reactors: A truly sustainable and full-scale resource for global energy needs, 1, pp. 546-558, (2010); Heidet, Florent, Neutron balance analysis for sustainability of breed-and-burn reactors, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 171, 1, pp. 13-31, (2012); Heidet, Florent, Breed-and-burn depleted uranium in fast reactors without actinides separation, 2, pp. 1661-1673, (2010); Greenspan, Ehud, Energy sustainability and economic stability with Breed and Burn reactors, Progress in Nuclear Energy, 53, 7, pp. 794-799, (2011)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","00295639; 1943748X","","NSENA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116338072"

This island is located off the coast of southern Vietnam. In addition, we discussed the phylogenetic relationships among C. finlaysonii subspecies distributed on the isolated islands in the Gulf of Thailand. The new subspecies (C. finlaysonii honnghensis), which is endemic to Hon Nghe Island, differs from other C. finlaysonii subspecies in pelage colouration. The mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences showed that this squirrel is closely related to C. finlaysonii albivexilli and C. finlaysonii frandseni, which are endemic to the Koh Kut and Koh Chang islands, respectively, suggesting that the three subspecies diverged approximately 30,000 years ago. After the last glacial maximum, many small islands were formed by the sea level rise in the Gulf of Thailand, which was a consequence of global warming. Following the continuous fragmentation of the Sunda Continent, each C. finlaysonii subspecies could have evolved in each geographically isolated island in this gulf. Thus, studying C. finlaysonii subspecies may be used to track the recent geological history of the Gulf of Thailand. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Callosciurus finlaysonii; cytochrome b; geographical isolation; Gulf of Thailand; Hon Nghe Island","fragmentation; geographical distribution; habitat fragmentation; island; Last Glacial Maximum; new species; phylogenetics; rodent; subspecies; Gulf of Thailand; Indochina; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Viet Nam","","","Research funding: This research was funded by The Program of Developing Basic Sciences in Chemistry, Life Sciences, Earth Sciences and Marine Sciences, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (KHCBSS.02/20\u201322), as well as partially supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research nos. 18H03602, 19H00534 and 20H01979 from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture, Japan and Idea Wild Grant.

The results quantified the impact of major core design choices on the criticality of a core that uses sodium as a coolant material and HT9 steel as structural material. The design variables examined include the binary metallic fuel U-Zr with different weight percentages of zirconium as well as different core heights and fuel rod pitch-to-diameter ratios (P/Ds) in the fuel assembly. We found that a core using the binary metallic fuel U-Zr with 2 wt% zirconium, with a core height of 200 cm, a P/D of 1.086, and a core power of 400 MW(thermal), could overcome some major design constraints. It was also found that with shuffling intervals of 1125 to 1250 days, the core with rotational fuel shuffling was critical in the equilibrium state, and the possible average discharged burnup was from 274.8 to 305.3 GWd/ton HM. Reactor characteristics such as neutron flux and power profile were almost stable during the equilibrium cycle. A steady-state thermal-hydraulic analysis was performed for the hottest channel in the core. It revealed that both the fuel and cladding maximum temperatures were less than the melting point of the fuel and the chemical interaction temperature of the HT-9, respectively.

However, the toxicity tests of CFX using eukaryotic organisms such as Daphnia magna are inadequate, and the test result of OFX is currently unknown. Therefore, the chronic toxicity test for D. magna was performed during 42 days under exposure to CFX and OFX concentrations of 50, 500, and 5000 μg L−1. All exposure conditions did not cause mortality for D. magna. CFX exposure at 500 μg L−1 resulted in an earlier oogenesis date and increased brood size in the second birth. The Poisson-based generalized linear mixed-effects model revealed that the reduction of fertility was statistically significant for the CFX and OFX exposures at 5000 μg L−1. On the other hand, the production of dead eggs as offspring degradation was also found significantly as maternal D. magna exposed to antibiotics at 5000 μg L−1. In addition, following long-term exposure to antibiotics, maternal adaptation to antibiotics was established for offspring deterioration and fertility. However, the OFX exposure showed that the fertility-suppressed effects continued for a longer period than the CFX exposure. Although no rational explanation has yet been given for the more substantial effect of OFX on reducing fertility than CFX, molecular cell biology and symbiotic microbial flora derived from previous studies could explain our ecotoxicological results. This study is the first report for the OFX chronic toxicities on D. magna by comparing it to the toxicity of CFX. Our study contributes to guiding the future impact assessment of fluoroquinolone antibiotic pollution on ecosystems, including the need for new statistical methods in ecotoxicological studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ciprofloxacin; Hormetic effects; Life-history traits; Offspring degradation; Ofloxacin","Cytology; Deterioration; Ecology; Toxicity; Chronic toxicity; Daphnia magna; Eco-toxicology; Fluoroquinolone antibiotics; Hormetic effects; Life-history traits; Long term exposure; Offspring degradation; Ofloxacin; Toxicity test; Antibiotics; ciprofloxacin; ofloxacin; antibiotics; crustacean; ecotoxicology; life history trait; pollution exposure; reproduction; Article; brood size; chronic toxicity; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation; deterioration; egg production; fertility; generalized linear mixed effects model; life history; long term exposure; maturity; mortality; newborn; nonhuman; oocyte development; statistical analysis; survival; toxicity testing; analysis; animal; Daphnia; ecosystem; toxicity; water pollutant; Eukaryota; Animals; Ciprofloxacin; Ecosystem; Ecotoxicology; Reproduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1, 86393-32-0, 128074-72-6, 128074-76-0, 192934-52-4, 93107-08-5, 86483-48-9, 96186-80-0; ofloxacin, 82419-36-1; Ciprofloxacin; Ofloxacin; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP20K20640 , Japan, and Nagasaki University WISE Programme Research , Japan.","Adamczuk, Małgorzata, Population dynamics and life history traits of Daphnia magna across thermal regimes of environments, Science of the Total Environment, 723, (2020); Aderemi, Adeolu O., Oxidative stress responses and cellular energy allocation changes in microalgae following exposure to widely used human antibiotics, Aquatic Toxicology, 203, pp. 130-139, (2018); Akbar, Siddiq, Changes in the life history traits of Daphnia magna are associated with the gut microbiota composition shaped by diet and antibiotics, Science of the Total Environment, 705, (2020); Albers, Casper J., The problem with unadjusted multiple and sequential statistical testing, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Allen, Heather K., Treatment, promotion, commotion: Antibiotic alternatives in food-producing animals, Trends in Microbiology, 21, 3, pp. 114-119, (2013); Aly, Salah Mesalhy, Antimicrobials use in aquaculture and their public health impact, Journal of Aquaculture Research and Development, 5, 4, (2014); Amarasiri, Mohan, Understanding human health risks caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in water environments: Current knowledge and questions to be answered, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 50, 19, pp. 2016-2059, (2020); Biological Bulletin, (1942); Bahrndorff, Simon, Automated swimming activity monitor for examining temporal patterns of toxicant effects on individual Daphnia magna, Journal of Applied Toxicology, 36, 7, pp. 896-902, (2016); Bednarska, Anna, Effect of non-toxic, filamentous cyanobacteria on egg abortion in daphnia under various thermal conditions, Hydrobiologia, 715, 1, pp. 151-157, (2013)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18736424; 02697491","","ENPOE","34537598","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115020252"

Rapid and accurate viral detection is a starting point in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic and flavivirus outbreaks. However, the shortage of diagnostic reagents and supplies, especially in resource-limited countries that experience co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and flaviviruses, are limitations that may result in lesser availability of RT-qPCR-based diagnostic tests. In this study, the utility of RNA-free extraction methods was assessed for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV-2 in heat-inactivated or chemical-inactivated samples. The findings demonstrate that direct real-time RT-qPCR is a feasible option in comparison to conventional real-time RT-qPCR based on viral genome extraction-based methods. The utility of heat-inactivation and direct real-time RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2, DENV-2 viral RNA detection was demonstrated by using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV-2 and spiked cell culture samples of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV-2. This study provides a simple alternative workflow for flavivirus and SARS-CoV-2 detection that includes heat inactivation and viral RNA extraction-free protocols, with aims to reduce the risk of exposure during processing of SARS-CoV-2 biological specimens and to overcome the supply-chain bottleneck, particularly in resource limited settings with flavivirus co-circulation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biosafety; DENV; Direct RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; Virus co-circulation; Virus inactivation","virus RNA; animal cell; antibody response; Article; bacterium detection; BHK-21 cell line; controlled study; copy number variation; Dengue virus; Flavivirus; nonhuman; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Vero cell line; virus detection; virus genome; virus inactivation","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors would like to acknowledge Makoto Takeda, Masayuki Saijo, Lim Chang-kweng and.

Here, LA-ICPMS is able to detect concentrations that are less than 0.1%. Using these methods and a large 110-mm diameter Czochralski method-grown cerium-doped lithium calcium aluminum fluoride (Ce3+:LiCaAlF<inf>6</inf> or Ce:LiCAF), we observed that Ce is distributed non-uniformly with varying concentrations across the diameter of the crystal boule. We further verify quantitatively that luminescence intensity increases in proportion to doping density. Ultraviolet (UV, 290-nm wavelength) laser emissions from areas of the Ce:LiCAF crystal having different doping distributions and concentrations reveal that a uniform doping distribution leads to a higher slope efficiency, lower laser threshold and a potentially higher damage threshold even though the doping concentration is low compared to areas with high but non-uniform doping. Our results show a means of improving laser performance by aiming to achieve a uniform doping distribution; and multi-photon luminescence and LA-ICPMS are powerful tools that could aid in this process.

However, the mechanisms whereby TMEPAI facilitates tumorigenesis are not fully understood. We previously established TMEPAI-knockout (KO) cells from human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and found that TMEPAI-KO cells showed reduced tumorigenic abilities. Here, we report that TMEPAI-KO cells upregulated the expression of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and leucinerich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) and suppressed AKT Ser473 phosphorylation, which was consistent with TCGA dataset analysis. Additionally, the knockdown (KD) of PHLPP1 in TMEPAI-KO cells partially but significantly rescued AKT Ser473 phosphorylation, as well as in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic activities, thus showing that TMEPAI functions as an oncogenic protein through the regulation of PHLPP1 subsequent to AKT activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TMEPAI PPxY (PY) motifs are essential for binding to NEDD4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and PHLPP1-downregulatory ability. Moreover, TMEPAI enhanced the complex formation of PHLPP1 with NEDD4-2 and PHLPP1 polyubiquitination, which leads to its proteasomal degradation. These findings indicate that the PY motifs of TMEPAI suppress the amount of PHLPP1 and maintain AKT Ser473 phosphorylation at high levels to enhance the tumorigenic potentiality of TNBC. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","membrane protein; PHLPP1 protein; phosphoprotein phosphatase; PMEPA1 protein; protein kinase B; TMEPAI protein; ubiquitin protein ligase NEDD4; ubiquitin protein ligase NEDD4-2; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast cancer cell line; carcinogenicity; complex formation; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme phosphorylation; female; gene knockout; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; proteasomal degradation; protein binding; protein degradation; protein expression; protein motif; triple negative breast cancer; ubiquitination; upregulation","","phosphoprotein phosphatase, 9025-75-6; protein kinase B, 148640-14-6; protein phosphatase 2c","This research was supported by JSPS Kakenhi grant numbers JP18K06682 (Y.W.), JP16K19100 (Y.W.), JP25870093 (Y.W.), JP21K06942 (Y.W.), JP18H02676 (M.K.), JP25293092 (M.K.), and JP20K20597 (M.K.).NEDD4-2 plasmid was a kind gift from T.

The main idea behind 1M5R is the use of good-quality/certified seeds (the One Must Do) as well as the reduction of seed rates, pesticide use, fertilizer inputs, water use, and postharvest losses (Five Reductions). However, the impact of these farming practices is not well understood. This study employs the propensity score matching (PSM) approach to investigate the factors that affect the adoption of the 1M5R practice and to estimate this technique's impact on the economic performance of rice cultivation. Primary data were collected through a household survey of 380 rice farms in four provinces in the Mekong Delta (MKD), Vietnam. The results indicate that adopting the 1M5R technique is significantly correlated with the educational level of household heads, their memberships in paddy cooperatives, and their attendance to previous training classes. Additionally, the 1M5R technical package helps farmers to reduce their production cost by 10%, increase a paddy's selling price by 4.5% per kg, and obtain 10% more profit, compared to traditional farming households. The return on investment for adopters increased by 22%. While the findings show that a sustainable farming technique is advantageous to local farmers, they fail to present any paddy yield increase in treatment fields. To scale up this program to other areas in the MKD, well-educated farmers who are still traditional producers/non-adopters should be positively invited for training classes of the program. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic performance; Five Reductions”; Mekong Delta; Propensity score matching; Rice smallholder; “One Must Do","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Profitability; Regional planning; Surveys; Agriculture and rural; Best management practices; Economic performance; Educational levels; Household surveys; Post-harvest loss; Propensity score matching; Sustainable Farming; Costs","","","We would like to express our appreciation to the Mekong Delta Development Research Institute's director and the leader of the MSVC project for their consent to acquire and use the dataset for analysis.

Device #1 consists of 17 pairs of thermoelectric elements with dimensions of 1 mm × 1 mm × 2 mm while device #2 has 127 pairs of thermoelectric elements with dimensions of 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm × 2 mm. Both devices are fabricated on the same substrate of 15 mm × 15 mm. Maximum output powers for devices #1 and #2 are obtained as 10.1 mW and 33.9 mW at temperature difference ΔT of 75 °C, respectively, while at low ΔT = 5 °C, those of devices #1 and #2 are 43 µW and 91 µW, respectively. Fabricated TEGs show higher performance in comparison to the recent related works. Moreover, the harvested energy from the fabricated TEG can be stored in a rechargeable battery via a DC-DC converter. The output of the DC-DC converter reaches 2.8 V and 4 V at ΔT = 2 °C and 8 °C, respectively, which corresponds to the DC-DC electronic conversion efficiency η<inf>DC-DC</inf> is 8.1% and 23.3%, respectively. The fabricated TEG as a power source for a calculator as well as a twist watch has been demonstrated successfully. The investigation in this work indicated that the fabricated TEG possesses a high potential for portable and wearable self-powered electronic devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electrochemical deposition; Portable and wearable self-powered electronic devices; Thermoelectric generator","DC-DC converters; Electrochemical deposition; Electronic equipment; Fabrication; Reduction; Wearable technology; DC converter; Electronics devices; High integration density; Performance; Portable and wearable self-powered electronic device; Self-powered; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermoelectric element; Thermoelectric generators; Thermoelectric equipment","","","Part of this work was performed in the Micro/Nanomachining Research Education Center (MNC) of Tohoku University.

Macrophages were reduced by intraperitoneal injection of a carrageenan solution at 12, 13, and 16 days old, whereas the control group received intraperitoneal phosphate-buffered saline. Both chick groups were orally inoculated with E. tenella sporulated oocysts at 14 days old. Feces were collected daily, which were then quantified for oocysts. The chicks were sacrificed on day 5, and the ceca were collected for histopathological observation. The gene expression levels were measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Macrophage-depleted chicks have been observed to shed a significantly reduced number of fecal oocysts compared to the infected control group. The parasite burden score in cecum specimens of macrophage-depleted chicks was significantly lower than those of infected control on day 5 after infection. Furthermore, macrophage reduction yielded significantly lower cecum histopathological scores and CD4 expression than those of the infected control group. The expression of interleukin (IL)-18, IL-22, interferon-γ, and inducible nitric oxide synthase was also noted to be significantly upregulated in both infected control and macrophage-depleted chicks compared to uninfected chicks. IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, and perforin expressions were also higher with macrophage depletion than in both control groups. These results suggest that macrophages serve as an invasive gate or a transporting vehicle to the site of first merogony. Furthermore, mononuclear phagocytes may play an important role in local immune responses, thus contributing to parasite development during early E. tenella infection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carrageenan; Eimeria tenella; Local immune response; Macrophage","carrageenan; animal; bird disease; cecum; chicken; coccidiosis; Eimeria tenella; macrophage; oocyst; parasitology; veterinary medicine; Animals; Carrageenan; Cecum; Chickens; Coccidiosis; Macrophages; Oocysts; Poultry Diseases","","carrageenan, 9000-07-1, 9049-05-2, 9061-82-9, 9064-57-7; Carrageenan","This research was supported by the Research Grant for Encouragement of Students, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University .","Györke, Adriana, Prevalence and distribution of Eimeria species in broiler chicken farms of different capacities, Parasite, 20, 1, (2013); Allen, Patricia C., Effects of Dietary Supplementation with n-3 Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters on Coccidiosis in Chickens, Poultry Science, 77, 11, pp. 1631-1635, (1998); Arstila, Tommi Petteri, Androgen-induced expansion of the peripheral blood γδ T cell population in the chicken, Journal of Immunology, 151, 12, pp. 6627-6633, (1993); Born, Willi K., Balanced approach of γδ T cells to type 2 immunity, Immunology and Cell Biology, 88, 3, pp. 269-274, (2010); Bumstead, Janene M., Comparison of immune responses in inbred lines of chickens to Eimeria maxima and Eimeria tenella, Parasitology, 111, 2, pp. 143-151, (1995); Parasitol, (2019); Challey, John R., The Invasion of the Cecal Mucosa by Eimeria tenella sporozoites and their Transport by Macrophages, Journal of Protozoology, 6, 3, pp. 238-241, (1959); Chien, Yueh Hsiu, γδ T cells: First line of defense and beyond, Annual Review of Immunology, 32, pp. 121-155, (2014); Cornelissen, Jan B.W.J., Host response to simultaneous infections with Eimeria acervulina, maxima and tenella: A cumulation of single responses, Veterinary Parasitology, 162, 1-2, pp. 58-66, (2009); Giulia, Costa, Control of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic cycle: γδ T cells target the red blood cell-invasive merozoites, Blood, 118, 26, pp. 6952-6962, (2011)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00345288; 15322661","","RVTSA","34252703","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109444853"

In the present study, we used an automated clean-up device equipped with pre-packed micro-column sets (containing sulfuric acid impregnated silica gel and silver-modified alumina) to develop an effective purification method for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), pentabromoethylbenzene, hexabromobiphenyl, and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) in sediment extracts. Matrix-spiked sediments (n = 6) and the Standard Reference Material® 1944 samples (n = 6) were tested. Our method showed acceptable accuracy, repeatability, and sensitivity for almost all the target compounds with reduced processing time, labor requirement, and solvent amounts as compared to conventional clean-up method (e.g., sulfuric acid treatment and self-packed chromatographic columns). The validated method was applied to sediment core samples (n = 16) collected in 2019 from Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan. PBDEs were detected in sediment samples of 0–13 cm depth (dated between 1990 and 2019) at relatively low concentrations (median 5.7; range 2.6–9.4 ng/g dry weight). PBDE profiles were dominated by BDE-209, which accounted for 91 ± 10% of total PBDEs. Among other BFRs, only DBDPE was found in sediment layers of 0–9 cm depth (deposited between 2005 and 2019). DBDPE concentrations ranged from 0.43 to 1.6 (median 0.71) ng/g and showed increasing trend toward shallower depths. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DBDPE; Lake biwa; PBDEs; Rapid clean-up method; Sediment","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Ethane; Ethers; Flame retardants; Lakes; Sediments; Silica gel; Sulfuric acid; 'current; Analytical method; Brominated flame retardants; Decabromodiphenyl ethane; Environmental concerns; Lake Biwa; Polybrominated diphenylethers; Rapid clean-up method; Sediment core; Sediment samples; Organic pollutants; biphenyl derivative; decabromodiphenyl ether; ethane; ether; flame retardant; polybrominated diphenyl ether; silica gel; silver; solvent; sulfuric acid; bromobenzene; decabromodiphenyl ethane; diphenyl ether derivative; analytical method; concentration (composition); detection method; lacustrine deposit; PBDE; sediment analysis; sediment chemistry; sediment core; Article; bromination; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dry weight; Japan; lake; measurement accuracy; measurement repeatability; purification; sediment; environmental monitoring; Biwa Lake; Honshu; Kinki; Shiga; Bromobenzenes; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers","","decabromodiphenyl ether, 1163-19-5; ethane, 74-84-0; ether, 60-29-7; silica gel, 63231-67-4; silver, 7440-22-4; sulfuric acid, 7664-93-9; bromobenzene, 108-86-1; Bromobenzenes; decabromodiphenyl ethane; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (SII-3-2: JPMEERF18S20320) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan (ERCA); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (17K00528 and 20H00646) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); the Joint Usage/Research Grants from Leading Academia in Marine and Environment Pollution Research (LaMer), Ehime University; and Center for Ecological Research (2017?2019 jurc-cer), Kyoto University.; Funding text 2: This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (SII-3-2: JPMEERF18S20320) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan (ERCA); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research ( 17K00528 and 20H00646 ) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); the Joint Usage/Research Grants from Leading Academia in Marine and Environment Pollution Research (LaMer), Ehime University; and Center for Ecological Research (2017\u20132019 jurc-cer), Kyoto University .","Abbasi, Golnoush, Global Historical Stocks and Emissions of PBDEs, Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 11, pp. 6330-6340, (2019); Abdallah, Mohamed Abou Elwafa, A one-step extraction/clean-up method for determination of PCBs, PBDEs and HBCDs in environmental solid matrices, Environmental Science: Processes and Impacts, 15, 12, pp. 2279-2287, (2013); Hoang, Anhquoc, PBDEs and novel brominated flame retardants in road dust from northern Vietnam: Levels, congener profiles, emission sources and implications for human exposure, Chemosphere, 197, pp. 389-398, (2018); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polyurethane foam-based passive air sampling for simultaneous determination of POP- and PAH-related compounds: A case study in informal waste processing and urban areas, northern Vietnam, Chemosphere, 247, (2020); Appendix F Guidelines for Standard Method Performance Requirements, (2016); Aota, Yasuaki, Estimation of vertical mixing based on water current monitoring in the hypolimnion of Lake Biwa, JSME International Journal, Series B: Fluids and Thermal Engineering, 49, 3, pp. 621-625, (2006); Appleby, Peter G., The calculation of lead-210 dates assuming a constant rate of supply of unsupported 210Pb to the sediment, Catena, 5, 1, pp. 1-8, (1978); Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments Volume 1 Basin Analysis Coring and Chronological Techniques, (2001); Chandrajith, R.L.

The plantation of fast-growing trees, such as Acacia spp., is expanding rapidly in tropical regions, which can contribute to conserve the remaining native tropical forests. To better understand belowground biogeochemical cycles and the sustainable productivity of acacia plantations, we assessed the effects of vegetation (acacia plantations vs. native forests) and soil types (Oxisols vs. Ultisols) on soil properties, including the diversity and community structures of bacteria- and fungi-colonizing surface and subsurface roots and soil in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The results in surface soil showed that pH was significantly higher in acacia than in native for Oxisols but not for Ultisols, while exchangeable Al was significantly lower in acacia than in native for Ultisols but not for Oxisols. Bacterial alpha diversity (especially within phylum Chloroflexi) was higher in acacia than in native only for Oxisols but not for Ultisols, which was the same statistical result as soil pH but not exchangeable Al. These results suggest that soil pH, but not exchangeable Al, can be the critical factor to determine bacterial diversity. Acacia tree roots supported greater proportions of copiotrophic bacteria, which may support lower contents of soil inorganic N, compared with native tree roots for both Oxisols and Ultisols. Acacia tree roots also supported greater proportions of plant pathogenic Mycoleptodiscus sp. but appeared to reduce the abundances and diversity of beneficial ECM fungi compared with native tree roots regardless of soil types. Such changes in fungal community structures may threaten the sustainable productivity of acacia plantations in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acacia plantations; FUNGuild; microbial diversity; Oxisols; root microbiome; tropical mountain forests; Ultisols","Acacia; article; bacterial colonization; biogeochemical cycle; Chloroflexi; community structure; forest; fungal community; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; phylum; plant disease; plant root; plantation; productivity; soil acidity; soil microflora; surface soil; vegetation; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Pham Cuong (Hue University), Chihiro Okada (Kyoto University), and the villagers of So’ n Lang commune for supports on field survey and giving us the field information, and Makoto Shibata (Kyoto University) and Tetsuhiro Watanabe (Kyoto University) for valuable discussions.; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (Nos. 17H06171, 18H02315 and 19K20434).","Baldrian, Petr, Forest microbiome: Diversity, complexity and dynamics, FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 41, 2, pp. 109-130, (2017); Ballauff, Johannes, Shifts in root and soil chemistry drive the assembly of belowground fungal communities in tropical land-use systems, Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 154, (2021); Berthrong, Sean T., A global meta-analysis of soil exchangeable cations, pH, carbon, and nitrogen with afforestation, Ecological Applications, 19, 8, pp. 2228-2241, (2009); Bonito, Gregory M., Plant host and soil origin influence fungal and bacterial assemblages in the roots of woody plants, Molecular Ecology, 23, 13, pp. 3356-3370, (2014); Brinkmann, Nicole, Intensive tropical land use massively shifts soil fungal communities, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Caporaso, J.

Concentrations of total PCBs ranged from 5.3 to 48 ng/g dry weight (dw), showing a highest peak at the 1960s to 1970s. The temporal trend of total PCBs in this sediment core generally matched with Japanese PCB production and emission pattern (i.e., increasing from the 1950s, peaking at 1970, and gradually decreasing since 1972). The vertical PCB profiles in our core were affected by physical mixing and bioturbation. By using a detailed and comprehensive analytical method, we have found elevated concentrations and special historical profiles of several congeners such as CB-7, -11, -47/48/75, -51, -68, and -209, which are still rarely included in routine PCB analysis. Some tetra-CB congeners like CB-47/48/75, -51, and -68 showed their concentration peaks at the early 2010s, which may be unintentionally produced during polymer manufacturing processes. PCB homolog- and congener-specific profiles in our sediment core samples have experienced weathering with higher proportions of penta- and hexa-CBs as compared to the Kanechlor usage pattern (i.e., dominated by tri- and tetra-CBs). Both intentional (i.e., technical mixtures) and unintentional (e.g., PCB-containing polymers and pigments) sources of PCBs were suggested from congener-specific analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Kanechlor; Lake sediment core; PCBs; Unintentional production; Weathering","Electric circuit breakers; Lake pollution; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Sediments; Weathering; Congener specific analysis; Dry weight; Historical records; Kanechlors; Lake Biwa; Lake sediment cores; PCB congeners; Sediment core; Temporal trends; Unintentional production; Lakes; pigment; polychlorinated biphenyl; polymer; silica gel; toluene; chemical substance; chemical weathering; lacustrine deposit; PCB; sediment core; sediment pollution; analytic method; Article; biological activity; bioturbation; chemical analysis; chronology; dry weight; freeze drying; industrialization; Japan; lake sediment; nonhuman; principal component analysis; sediment; Soxhlet extraction; urbanization; water solubility; weathering","","silica gel, 63231-67-4; toluene, 108-88-3","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (SII-3-2: JPMEERF18S20320) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan (ERCA); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (17K00528 and 20H00646) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); the Joint Usage/Research Grants from Leading Academia in Marine and Environment Pollution Research (LaMer), Ehime University; and Center for Ecological Research (2017?2019 jurc-cer), Kyoto University.; Funding text 2: This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund ( SII-3-2: JPMEERF18S20320 ) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan (ERCA); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research ( 17K00528 and 20H00646 ) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); the Joint Usage/Research Grants from Leading Academia in Marine and Environment Pollution Research (LaMer), Ehime University ; and Center for Ecological Research (2017\u20132019 jurc-cer), Kyoto University .","undefined, (2008); Anezaki, Katsunori, Estimation of Polychlorinated Biphenyl Sources in Industrial Port Sediments Using a Bayesian Semifactor Model Considering Unidentified Sources, Environmental Science and Technology, 50, 2, pp. 765-771, (2016); Hoang, Anhquoc, Characterization of 209 polychlorinated biphenyls in street dust from northern Vietnam: Contamination status, potential sources, and risk assessment, Science of the Total Environment, 652, pp. 345-355, (2019); Hoang, Anhquoc, Polychlorinated biphenyls in settled dusts from an end-of-life vehicle processing area and normal house dusts in northern Vietnam: Occurrence, potential sources, and risk assessment, Science of the Total Environment, 728, (2020); Hoang, Anhquoc, Unintentionally produced polychlorinated biphenyls in pigments: An updated review on their formation, emission sources, contamination status, and toxic effects, Science of the Total Environment, 755, (2021); Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments Volume 1 Basin Analysis Coring and Chronological Techniques, (2001); Appleby, Peter G., The calculation of lead-210 dates assuming a constant rate of supply of unsupported 210Pb to the sediment, Catena, 5, 1, pp. 1-8, (1978); Bigus, Paulina, Historical records of organic pollutants in sediment cores, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 78, 1-2, pp. 26-42, (2014); Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines, (2001); Chandrajith, R.L.

While the assay is useful in the determination of infectivity, conventional plaque assays generally possess lower sensitivity and are time-consuming compared to nucleic acid amplification tests. In this study, a microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), Avicel, was evaluated as an alternative to the conventional virus overlay medium, methylcellulose, for a plaque assay. The plaque assay was performed using dengue and COVID-19 clinical samples and laboratory-established flavivirus and SARS-CoV-2 strains. In virus titration of clinical samples, the plaques were significantly larger, and the virus titers were higher when Avicel MCC-containing overlay medium was used than with conventional methylcellulose overlay medium. In addition, for some clinical samples and laboratory virus strains, infectious particles were detected as plaques in the Avicel MCC-containing medium, but not in the conventional methylcellulose medium. The results suggest that the viremia titer determined using the new overlay medium containing Avicel MCC may better reflect the innate infectious and plaque-forming capabilities of clinical samples and better reflect virus infectivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culture medium; Dengue; Infectious particles; Infectivity assessment; SARS-CoV-2","microcrystalline cellulose; neutralizing antibody; assay; dengue fever; infectious disease; particulate matter; severe acute respiratory syndrome; viral disease; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; BHK-21 cell line; dengue; Dengue virus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fetal bovine serum; fever; Flavivirus; Flavivirus infection; health care personnel; limit of detection; nonhuman; plaque assay; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vero 9013 cell line; viremia; virus detection; virus infectivity; virus load; virus replication; virus shedding; virus strain; virus titration; Zika fever; Zika virus; human; SARS coronavirus; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Viremia; Virus Shedding","","microcrystalline cellulose, 39394-43-9, 51395-75-6","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) under the AMED Japan Program for Infectious Diseases Research and Infrastructure (JP21wm0125006, and JP21wm0225018), Research on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (21fk0108109h0003, 21fk0108123h1102, 21wm0225001s0102, 21jm0210086h0002), and Nagasaki University.

In this study, we compared the anatomy of the feeding apparatus of five oxudercine gobies, Boleophthalmus boddarti (moderately terrestrial, herbivorous), Oxuderces nexipinnis (nearly aquatic, herbivorous), Scartelaos histophorus (moderately terrestrial, omnivorous), Periophthalmus chrysospilos (highly terrestrial, carnivorous), and Periophthalmodon schlosseri (highly terrestrial, carnivorous), collected from a mudflat in Vietnam. B. boddarti and O. nexipinnis are characterized by a horizontal disposition of the dentary teeth, more densely spaced gill rakers on the posterior row of the third arch and both rows of the fourth arch, and large, ventrally curved pharyngeal plates bearing numerous fine teeth. Ps. chrysospilos and Pn. schlosseri have oral jaw bones with jaw-levers producing a greater biting force, rudimentary gill rakers, and pharyngeal plates studded with robust canine teeth. On the underside of the ventral plates, prominent ridges occur, onto which strong muscles attach. The jaw adductors are larger in these carnivorous mudskippers. S. histophorus shows an anatomical architecture which may be considered intermediate between these herbivorous and carnivorous species. On the basis of currently accepted relationships of oxudercine genera, their feeding habits, and the morphology of the feeding apparatus, we hypothesize that the oxudercine gobies had been adapted to feeding microalgae in shallow water before expanding their niche onto land, and subsequently diverged to more specialized herbivorous (Boleophthalmus) and carnivorous groups (Periophthalmus and Periophthalmodon) feeding in higher intertidal habitats. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feeding apparatus; Functional morphology; Mudskippers","","","","Funding text 1: We would like to acknowledge Dr. Gianluca Polgar (CNR IRSA Water Research Institute, Verbania, Italy) for his careful reading and insightful comments on the manuscript.

Bioremediation has been proven to be an effective, economical, and eco-friendly technique to remove heavy metals from various wastewaters. The newly developed algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has emerged as a promising biosorbent for treating wastewater containing heavy metals, especially Cr(VI). In this study, two identical cylindrical sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), i.e., R1 (Control) and R2 (with 1% additional salinity), were used to cultivate algal-bacterial AGS and then to evaluate the effect of salinity on the performance of the two SBRs. The results reflected that less filamentation and a rougher surface could be observed on algal-bacterial AGS when exposed to 1% salinity, which showed little influence on organics removal. However, the removals of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and total phosphorus (TP) were noticeably impacted at the 1% salinity condition, and were further decreased with the co-existence of 2 mg/L Cr(VI). The Cr(VI) removal efficiency, on the other hand, was 31–51% by R1 and 28–48% by R2, respectively, indicating that salinity exposure may slightly influence Cr(VI) bioremediation. In addition, salinity exposure stimulated more polysaccharides excretion from algal-bacterial AGS while Cr(VI) exposure promoted proteins excretion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge; Bioremediation; Hexavalent chromium; Salinity; Wastewater treatment","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The first author, Bach Van Nguyen, would like to thank the financial and technical support by the Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship by Japanese Grant Aid (JDS), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Institute of Marine Environment and Resources (IMER), Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Vietnam for supporting his study in University of Tsukuba, Japan.; Funding text 2: Funding: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP18H03403.","Sartore, Luciana, Preparation and Heavy Metal Ions Chelating Properties of Multifunctional Polymer-Grafted Silica Hybrid Materials, Advances in Materials Science and Engineering, 2019, (2019); Gibb, Herman Jones, Lung cancer among workers in chromium chemical production, American Journal of Industrial Medicine, 38, 2, pp. 115-126, (2000); Zhitkovich, Anatoly V., Chromium in drinking water: Sources, metabolism, and cancer risks, Chemical Research in Toxicology, 24, 10, pp. 1617-1629, (2011); Tumolo, Marina, Chromium pollution in European water, sources, health risk, and remediation strategies: An overview, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 15, pp. 1-25, (2020); Mitra, Sayak, Removal of chromium from industrial effluents using nanotechnology: a review, Nanotechnology for Environmental Engineering, 2, 1, (2017); Brasili, Elisa, Remediation of hexavalent chromium contaminated water through zero-valent iron nanoparticles and effects on tomato plant growth performance, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Fu, Fenglian, Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 92, 3, pp. 407-418, (2011); Pushkar, Bhupendra Kishanprasad, Chromium pollution and its bioremediation mechanisms in bacteria: A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 287, (2021); Joseph, Lesley, Removal of heavy metals from water sources in the developing world using low-cost materials: A review, Chemosphere, 229, pp. 142-159, (2019); Zabochnicka, Magdalena, Potentials of biosorption and bioaccumulation processes for heavy metal removal, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies, 23, 2, pp. 551-561, (2014)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","22279717","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113340694"

Sodium was selected as the alkaline element, and a standard wire without sodium (wire 1) and three wires with 0.028, 0.056, and 0.084 mass% sodium (wire 2, 3, and 4) were prototyped. They were observed using a high-speed video camera equipped with laser illumination, which clarified that the droplet transfer frequency tended to increase proportionally with the amount of sodium added. Subsequently, the line spectra of the iron atom (particularly the Fe I 537.1 nm line) and sodium atom (particularly the Na I 589.0 nm line) were primarily observed using a bandpass filter. Iron vapor evaporated from the droplet bottom, while sodium vapor mainly evaporated from the molten wire tip or the neck between the wire and the droplet because of its low boiling point. Because the sodium atom has a low ionization energy, we considered that a new current path of sodium plasma was directly formed from the tip or neck of the molten wire through the arc plasma to the molten pool, bypassing the inside of the droplet. The formation of this new current path was considered to reduce the current of the iron plasma flowing from the droplet bottom reducing the arc pressure and further enhance the electromagnetic force acting on the neck to promote droplet detachment, thereby increasing the metal transfer frequency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkaline element; MCAW; Metal transfer; Metal vapor","Atoms; Bandpass filters; Drops; High speed cameras; Iron compounds; Metals; Sodium compounds; Video cameras; Alkaline elements; Arc-welding; Current paths; High-Speed video camera; Laser illumination; Metal cored arc welding; Metal transfers; Metal vapor; Sodium atom; Transfer process; Wire","","","The authors are grateful for the support toward this study by a joint research agreement between the Joining and Welding Research Institute, Osaka University, Japan; Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam; Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan; Thai Kobelco Welding Co.

The mutation caused potato leaf style and high parthenocarpic fruit set ratio (nearly 90%). Introducing iaa9-3 mutation into tomato cultivar has some advantages over other parthenocarpic mutants, including, (1) retaining the normal stamen structure and fertile pollen; (2) the parthenocarpic lines can produce sufficient seeds for self-pollinated propagation; (3) average seedless fruit weight of experimental lines ranged from 25 g/fruit (small category) to over 50 g/fruit (intermediate category), together with good number of fruits/plant which can lead to a theoretical seedless fruit yield of over 3000 g/plant, which is acceptable for commercial varieties; (4) increasing the quality of seedless fruits compared to seeded fruits which is attributable to an increase in the mass of placental area and a higher Brix level than locule and pericarp areas.

Rapid recovery is meaningful because delays increase social costs and deepen and prolong economic and social pain. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated the post-flood recovery speed in association with household characteristics and social connections and identified the contribution of these actors in different recovery sub-phases. Four flood-prone villages in Quang Dien district, Thua Thien Hue Province, central Vietnam, were selected for this case study. The multiple linear regression model (OLS) determining the post-flood recovery speed first indicated the ineffectiveness of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including age, educational qualifications, number of laborers, non-farm jobs, and income level. Social connection, meanwhile, appeared as a crucial factor accelerating households' rehabilitation. Accordingly, connections with relatives and informal groups were more valuable than those with friends, neighbors, and formal groups. The subdivision of the recovery process further reveals the variation in the role of connections in different recovery sub-phases. The key role of relatives and neighbors was highlighted through their striking support in almost all categories, both in the immediate post-flood and in the short-term phase. Though fairly modest in the early stage, support from friends, formal groups, informal groups, and local government, tended to increase in the short-term (especially for informal groups and local governments). The long-term recovery phase witnessed significant contributions from local government through financial and career-related support. Besides stressing the vital role of social connection in accelerating post-flood recovery, these findings pointed out their dynamics in the recovery sub-phases that should be integrated into the post-flood rehabilitation policy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Flood; Natural hazards; Post-flood recovery; Social capitals; Social connections","","","","The rehabilitation process began shortly after the floodwater receded. Support related to emotions, shelter, supplies, information, and cleanup were the most common during the first days after the flood ( Fig. 4 ). Debris cleaning is the most popular help since it was received by nearly half of the respondents (48.78%), followed by emotions, supplies, and information (about 40%), and shelters (14.63%). The roles of relatives and neighbors were underscored in this stage; they provided the most support in almost all categories. Mental support, although non-financial, is extremely important, especially for those who experienced severe damage. Households reported that emotional support is indispensable for them to overcome flood-induced stress. Almost 40% of households received this type of support from neighbors, while over 20% were obtained from relatives. Similarly, 32% and 39% of households were supported by neighbors and relatives in cleaning up deposits and debris, respectively. For most households, cleaning mud deposits took place immediately after the floodwater had receded. This work is much easier with a water layer on the floor. This type of help is often directed towards solitary or labor-scarce households. In addition, providing temporary shelters was also mainly done by neighbors at about 10%. In contrast, the contribution of the local government in this emergency time was only reflected through supports related to information and necessities. The authorities provided urgent necessities to 25% and information to 31% of households. Most of them are poverty-stricken or harshly damaged households. Supports from friends and formal groups were negligible during this period.","Climate Change 2014 Mitigation of Climate Change, (2014); Natural Disasters 2018, (2019); Building Resilience Social Capital in Post Disaster Recovery, (2012); Nguyen Duc, Kien, Evidence of climatic change in Vietnam: Some implications for agricultural production, Journal of Environmental Management, 231, pp. 524-545, (2019); Global Climate Risk Index 2014, (2013); Worlds 15 Countries with the Most People Exposed to River Floods, (2015); Nat Hazards Earth Syst Sci Discuss, (2017); undefined, (2013); Weathering the Storm Options for Disaster Risk Financing in Vietnam, (2010); Chan, N.

This study evaluated the performance of a novel flat-sheet submerged NF membrane module at low water flux to minimize membrane fouling. The separation performance of the NF system was assessed by periodically measuring the color, turbidity, pH, UV light absorbance at the wavelength of 254 nm, and total organic carbon concentrations of the NF feed water and permeate. During the 48-d test, negligible membrane fouling was found when direct NF treatment of secondary wastewater effluent was conducted at a water flux of 3 L/m2h. The trans-membrane pressure increased by less than 0.072 kPa/d. The foulant layer on the membrane surface was readily removed by simple physical cleaning, which suggests that the reversible fouling was the major fouling mechanism. Direct NF treatment achieved high and stable removal of organics (total organic carbon removal of >80 %) during the operation period. This study demonstrated the efficacy of the direct NF treatment using a submerged NF module for achieving stable operations and producing high-quality recycled water. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced wastewater treatment; Direct nanofiltration; Membrane fouling mitigation; Non-potable water reuse; Water reclamation","","","","We thank AWA Paper & Technological Company for providing and assembling an NF membrane module.

One of the possible applications of borophene is gas sensing. However, the interaction between common gases and β12 borophene remains to be clarified. In this work, we study the interactions of β12 borophene towards five hazardous gases, namely, CO, NO, NH3, NO2, and CO2 using various non-empirical van der Waals density functionals and provide an insight into the adsorption behavior of borophene. The adsorption mechanism and molecular vibrations are discussed in great detail. Among the gases considered, CO2 is physisorbed while other gases are chemically bonded to β12 borophene. We also demonstrate that the deformation at the ridge of borophene enables its active pz orbital to strongly hybridize with frontier orbitals of the studied polar gases. Consequently, borophene is predicted to interact strongly with CO, NO, NH3, and especially NO2, making it a sensitive sensing material for toxic gases.

Salmonella was detected in 75% (30/40), 57.1% (12/21), 17.5% (28/160), and 2.5% (1/40) of river water, irrigation water, vegetable, and ice water samples, respectively. However, no Salmonella was isolated from 160 fruit and 40 tap water samples examined. A total of 102 isolates obtained from 71 samples belonged to 34 different serovars, of which Salmonella Rissen was the most prevalent, followed by Salmonella London, Salmonella Hvittingfoss, and Salmonella Weltevreden. Certain Salmonella serovars such as Newport, Rissen, and Weltevreden were isolated from both vegetable and water samples. Antimicrobial resistance was most commonly observed against tetracycline (35.3%), followed by chloramphenicol (34.3%), ampicillin (31.4%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (23.5%), and nalidixic acid (10.8%). Of 102 isolates analyzed, 52 (51%) showed resistance to at least 1 antimicrobial class whereas 27 (26.5%) showed multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype, being resistant to at least three different classes of antimicrobials. Determination of the presence and type of β-lactamase genes showed the cooccurrence of blaTEM-1 and blaCMY-2 in one Salmonella Agona isolate from a river water sample. Taken together, these data indicated that both environmental water and vegetables were contaminated with Salmonella, including MDR strains, and that environmental water used in irrigation might have been the source of Salmonella contamination in the vegetables. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blaCMY-2,vegetable; environmental water; extended-spectrum β-lactamase; Salmonella; Vietnam","ampicillin; antibiotic agent; beta lactamase; beta lactamase CMY 2; beta lactamase TEM 1; cefotaxime; cefoxitin; ceftazidime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; cotrimoxazole; fosfomycin; gentamicin; kanamycin; nalidixic acid; river water; tetracycline; unclassified drug; water; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium contamination; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; controlled study; fruit; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; Salmonella; Salmonella enterica serovar Agona; serotype; vegetable; Viet Nam; epidemiology; food control; genetics; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Food Microbiology; Fruit; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Prevalence; Serogroup; Vegetables; Vietnam; Water Microbiology","","ampicillin, 69-52-3, 69-53-4, 7177-48-2, 74083-13-9, 94586-58-0; beta lactamase, 9073-60-3; cefotaxime, 63527-52-6, 64485-93-4; cefoxitin, 33564-30-6, 35607-66-0; ceftazidime, 72558-82-8; chloramphenicol, 134-90-7, 2787-09-9, 56-75-7; ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1, 86393-32-0, 128074-72-6, 128074-76-0, 192934-52-4, 93107-08-5, 86483-48-9, 96186-80-0; cotrimoxazole, 8064-90-2; fosfomycin, 23155-02-4; gentamicin, 1392-48-9, 1403-66-3, 1405-41-0; kanamycin, 11025-66-4, 61230-38-4, 8063-07-8; nalidixic acid, 389-08-2; tetracycline, 23843-90-5, 60-54-8, 64-75-5, 8021-86-1; water, 7732-18-5; Anti-Bacterial Agents","This study was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science RONPAKU (Dissertation Ph.D.) program (R11713) and the basic research grant from Osaka Prefecture University.","Altschul, Stephen F., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs, Nucleic Acids Research, 25, 17, pp. 3389-3402, (1997); Braun, Gianna Carina, Pesticides and antibiotics in permanent rice, alternating rice-shrimp and permanent shrimp systems of the coastal Mekong Delta, Vietnam, Environment International, 127, pp. 442-451, (2019); Castellanos, Luis Ricardo, Phylogenomic investigation of IncI1-I plasmids harboring blaCMY-2 and blaSHV-12 in salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli in multiple countries, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 63, 7, (2019); Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, (2019); Journal of Food and Nutrition Research, (2014); Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, (2018); Galanis, Eleni, Web-based surveillance and global Salmonella distribution, 2000-2002, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 12, 3, pp. 381-388, (2006); Granda, Ana, Presence of Extended-Spectrum β-lactamase, CTX-M-65 in Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis Isolated from Children with Diarrhea in Lima, Peru, Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, 14, 4, pp. 194-200, (2019); Greene, Sharon K., Recurrent multistate outbreak of salmonella newport associated with tomatoes from contaminated fields, 2005, Epidemiology and Infection, 136, 2, pp. 157-165, (2008); Antigenic Formulae of the Salmonella Serovars, (2007)","","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","","","","","","15567125; 15353141","","","33902318","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105724886"

Here, we found that targeted disruption of the entire Cables2 locus (Cables2d) caused growth retardation and enhanced apoptosis at the gastrulation stage and then induced embryonic lethality in mice. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed disruption of Cables2, 50% down-regulation of Rps21 abutting on the Cables2 locus, and up-regulation of p53-target genes in Cables2d gastrulas. We further revealed the lethality phenotype in Rps21- deleted mice and unexpectedly, the exon 1-deleted Cables2 mice survived. Interestingly, chimeric mice derived from Cables2d ESCs carrying exogenous Cables2 and tetraploid wild-type embryo overcame gastrulation. These results suggest that the diminished expression of Rps21 and the completed lack of Cables2 expression are intricately involved in the embryonic lethality via the p53 pathway. This study sheds light on the importance of Cables2 locus in mouse embryonic development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","aminomethyltransferase; beta catenin; beta galactosidase; bone morphogenetic protein 4; Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 2; cer1 protein; cytokine; edoxudine; fibroblast growth factor 8; left right determination factor; LIM homeobox 1; octamer transcription factor 4; protein kinase; protein Nodal; protein p53; ribosomal protein S21; ribosome protein; transcription factor; transcription factor Sox17; unclassified drug; Wnt3 protein; Cables2 protein, mouse; cell cycle protein; Trp53 protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; canonical Wnt signaling; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; embryo development; embryonic lethality; female; gastrulation; gene disruption; gene expression; genetic complementation; growth retardation; histology; homologous recombination; human; human cell; in situ hybridization; lethality; luciferase assay; male; mouse; nonhuman; p53 signaling; phenotype; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequencing; tetraploid complementation assay; transcriptomics; TUNEL assay; upregulation; whole-mount in situ hybridization; Wnt signaling; animal; genetics; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; signal transduction; transcription initiation; Animals; Cell Cycle Proteins; Female; Gastrulation; Gene Expression; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Phenotype; Ribosomal Proteins; Signal Transduction; Transcriptional Activation; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Up-Regulation","","aminomethyltransferase, 37257-08-2; beta galactosidase; edoxudine, 15176-29-1; fibroblast growth factor 8, 164003-41-2; protein kinase, 9026-43-1; Cables2 protein, mouse; Cell Cycle Proteins; ribosomal protein S21; Ribosomal Proteins; Trp53 protein, mouse; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research(B), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS KAKENHI 17H03568 Fumihiro Sugiyama Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research(S), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS KAKENHI 26221004 Satoru Takahashi Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research(C), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS KAKENHI 17K07130 Hiroyoshi Iseki Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS KAKENHI 19K16020 Tra Thi Huong Dinh Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research(A), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS KAKENHI 20H00444 Fumihiro Sugiyama The Cooperative Research Project Program of Life Science Center for Survival Dynamics, Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance (TARA Center), University of Tsukuba, Japan 182107 Fumihiro Sugiyama.","Arkell, Ruth M., Initiating head development in mouse embryos: Integrating signalling and transcriptional activity, Open Biology, 2, MARCH, (2012); Arnason, Thomas, Cables1 is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates intestinal tumor progression in ApcMin mice, Cancer Biology and Therapy, 14, 7, pp. 672-678, (2013); Arnold, Sebastian J., Brachyury is a target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, Mechanisms of Development, 91, 1-2, pp. 249-258, (2000); Arthurs, Callum, Expression of ribosomal proteins in normal and cancerous human prostate tissue, PLOS ONE, 12, 10, (2017); Avilion, Ariel A., Multipotent cell lineages in early mouse development depend on SOX2 function, Genes and Development, 17, 1, pp. 126-140, (2003); Bachler, Monika, Expression of members of the Fgf family and their receptors during midfacial development, Mechanisms of Development, 100, 2, pp. 313-316, (2001); Barkić, Martina, The p53 tumor suppressor causes congenital malformations in Rpl24-deficient mice and promotes their survival, Molecular and Cellular Biology, 29, 10, pp. 2489-2504, (2009); Belo, José António, Cerberus-like is a secreted factor with neuralizing activity expressed in the anterior primitive endoderm of the mouse gastrula, Mechanisms of Development, 68, 1-2, pp. 45-57, (1997); Chambers, Ian, Functional expression cloning of Nanog, a pluripotency sustaining factor in embryonic stem cells, Cell, 113, 5, pp. 643-655, (2003); Chazaud, Claire, Early Lineage Segregation between Epiblast and Primitive Endoderm in Mouse Blastocysts through the Grb2-MAPK Pathway, Developmental Cell, 10, 5, pp. 615-624, (2006)","","eLife Sciences Publications Ltd","","","","","","2050084X","","","33949947","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105494480"

Recognizing this fact, this study examined the long-term improvement in precautions taken by commune authorities and households between two major floods in 1999 and 2017 by applying both quantitative and qualitative methods. Two flood-prone villages were selected for a survey; one in a rural area and the other in a suburban area of Thua Thien Hue Province, central Vietnam. The findings indicate that most villagers doubted the structural works’ efficacy and were dissatisfied with the current efforts of local authorities. Households’ self-preparation thus became the decisive factor in mitigating risk. While most households have paid greater attention to flood precautions in 2017, others seem to be lagging. Poverty-related barriers were the root causes restraining households in both rural and suburban villages. The suburban riverine residents were further identified as vulnerable by their limitations in upgrading structural measures, which was ascribed to the inconsistency in the ancient town’s preservation policy. This multidimensional comparison, in terms of vulnerability, emphasized the importance of space-function links in the suburb and the contradictions of different policy initiatives, such as landscape rehabilitation, disaster prevention, and livelihood maintenance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Vietnam; Flood risk mitigation; Long-term improvement; Natural hazards; Precautionary measures","flood frequency; livelihood; lowland environment; mitigation; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; suburban area; vulnerability; Thua Thien Hue; Viet Nam","","","This study was financially supported by the Vietnamese government and Okayama University, Japan.

Therefore, the efforts to eliminate leishmaniasis are daunting if we cannot manage asymptomatic leishmaniasis well. To clarify the global prevalence and factors associated with the asymptomatic Leishmania infection, we assessed the prevalence of asymptomatic leishmaniasis by a systematic review followed by meta-analyses. In addition, factors associated with the asymptomatic leishmaniasis versus symptomatic were also analyzed. We included all of the original articles alluding to the human asymptomatic leishmaniasis that was confirmed by at least one laboratory diagnosis method regardless of age, sex, race, and ethnicity of the patients, study design, publication date or languages. In total, 111 original articles were chosen for the data extraction. Based on our meta-analyses of the original articles reporting asymptomatic leishmaniasis mostly in endemic areas, the prevalence of asymptomatic leishmaniasis was 11.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.6%-14.4%] in general population, 36.7% [95% CI 27.6%-46.8%] in inhabitants living in the same or neighboring household to the symptomatic patients, and 11.8% [95% CI 7.1%-19%] in HIV infected patients. Among individuals with leishmaniasis, 64.9% [95% CI 54.7%-73.9%] were asymptomatic and males were more susceptible to develop symptoms, with OR=1.88, 95% CI 1.19-2.99, P=0.007.

This paper investigates the determinants of a negative net leverage policy. Previous literature argues that zero-leverage is the result of high growth opportunity. However, by using a sample of Japanese non-financial firms over the period 1991–2015, we find that the driving forces of negative net leverage policy are low growth opportunity, low default possibility, and high cash holdings. Furthermore, a lower risk-free rate induces firms to increase cash holding, and therefore decrease net leverage. As time goes by, negative net leverage firms cease to accumulate cash and gradually repay debt. We suggest that policymakers improve the investment environment and enhance the effective allocation of firm funding, especially during a period of low risk-free rates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash; Investment; Leverage; Net debt; Zero leverage","","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful for helpful comments from the editor and two anonymous referees.We would like to thank the participants/discussants at the following workshops/conferences, including World Finance & Banking Symposium (Taichung, Taiwan), Vietnam Symposium in Banking and Finance (Hue city, Vietnam), Royal Economic Society (Sussex, the UK); INFINITI Conference on International Finance (Poznan, Poland); Econometric Research in Finance workshop (Warsaw, Poland), and seminar at Osaka University, Japan.

Stress is tightly linked to autonomic responses such as cardiovascular responses, yet how the LHb regulates these responses is not well understood. To address this issue, we electrically stimulated the LHb in rats, measured its effects on heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), and investigated the neural circuits that mediate these LHb-induced cardiovascular responses via the autonomic nervous system. We observed that stimulation of the LHb induced bradycardia and pressor responses, whereas stimulation of the adjacent areas changed neither the HR nor the MAP. Bilateral vagotomy and administration of a muscarinic receptor antagonist suppressed the LHb stimulation effect on the HR but not on the MAP, whereas administration of a β-adrenoceptor antagonist partly attenuated the effect on the MAP but not on the HR. Thus, the LHb-induced cardiovascular responses of the HR and the MAP were likely caused by activations of the cardiac parasympathetic nerves and the cardiovascular sympathetic nerves, respectively. Furthermore, administration of a non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist significantly attenuated the LHb stimulation effects on both the MAP and the HR. A 5-HT<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist also attenuated the LHb stimulation effects. A low dose of a 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor antagonist enhanced the LHb stimulation effects, but a high dose of the drug attenuated them. 5-HT<inf>1B</inf> and 5-HT<inf>1D</inf> receptor antagonists as well as a 5-HT<inf>7</inf> receptor antagonist did not affect the LHb stimulation effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that the LHb regulates autonomic cardiovascular responses at least partly through the serotonergic system, particularly via the 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> and 5-HT<inf>2</inf> receptors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autonomic nervous system; cardiovascular; parasympathetic nervous system; serotonergic system; stress; sympathetic nervous system","muscarinic receptor blocking agent; serotonin 1A antagonist; serotonin 1A receptor; serotonin 1B antagonist; serotonin 1D antagonist; serotonin 2 receptor; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; autonomic nervous system function; bradycardia; cardiovascular response; controlled study; electrostimulation; habenula; heart rate; histology; lateral habenula; male; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; parasympathetic nerve; pressor response; rat; serotoninergic system; sympathetic nerve; vagotomy","","","Funding text 1: The research was supported by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Kakenhi (19H03339).

The results revealed a tendency of geographical differentiation and major and sub-lineage divergences before and after the Riss glaciation, followed by stable population growth during Würm glaciation. At least four refugia were inferred for N. swinhoei during the Riss–Würm glaciations. The ancestral haplotype retention in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and compensated substitution in 16S rRNA gene is a possible evolutionary scenario resulting in the inconsistent evolution pattern between COI and 16S rRNA gene coupled with the long-distance dispersal of N. swinhoei. Although the CMR did hinder the dispersal of N. swinhoei, its ancestors may have dispersed to eastern Taiwan through the northern and southern low mountains of the CMR before the Riss glaciation. Our finding suggests that the population growth in the Würm glaciation led a dispersal back to western Taiwan, which is contrast to the more common dispersal scenario from western Taiwan to eastern populations proposed in other studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ancestral haplotype determination; Dispersal route; Mountain hindrance; Neolucanus swinhoei complex (NSC); Recent population expansion","","","","The first author, C.-L.T., thank the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 105-2917-I-005-004) for providing the study abroad grant in the Department of Forest Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, the University of Tokyo, Japan.

Like mesopo-rous silica nanoparticles (MSN), BPMO possesses a large surface area where various compounds can be attached. In this work, we attached boronophenylalanine (10BPA) to the surface and explored the potential of this nanomaterial for delivering boron-10 for use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This cancer therapy is based on the principle that the exposure of boron-10 to thermal neutron results in the release of α-particles that kill cancer cells. To attach10BPA, the surface of BPMO was modified with diol groups which facilitated the efficient binding of10BPA, yielding10BPA-loaded BPMO (10 BPA-BPMO). Surface modification with phosphonate was also carried out to increase the dispersibility of the nanoparticles. To investigate this nanomaterial’s potential for BNCT, we first used human cancer cells and found that10 BPA-BPMO nanoparticles were efficiently taken up into the cancer cells and were localized in perinuclear regions. We then used a chicken egg tumor model, a versatile and convenient tumor model used to characterize nanomaterials. After observing significant tumor accumulation,10 BPA-BPMO injected chicken eggs were evaluated by irradiating with neutron beams. Dramatic inhibition of the tumor growth was observed. These results suggest the potential of10BPA-BPMO as a novel boron agent for BNCT. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradable periodic mesoporous organosilica; Boron neutron capture therapy; Boronophenylalanine; Cancer cells; Chicken egg tumor model","4 boronophenylalanine; boron 10; mesoporous silica nanoparticle; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; phosphonic acid derivative; antineoplastic agent; boron derivative; metal nanoparticle; organosilicon derivative; phenylalanine; alpha radiation; Article; bioaccumulation; biodegradability; boron neutron capture therapy; cancer inhibition; cancer therapy; cell killing; chemical binding; chemical modification; chicken; controlled study; egg; human; human cell; neutron radiation; nonhuman; particle size; surface area; tumor growth; tumor model; tumor volume; tumor weight; apoptosis; cell proliferation; chemistry; neoplasm; pathology; tumor cell culture; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Boron Compounds; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Organosilicon Compounds; Phenylalanine; Tumor Cells, Cultured","","4 boronophenylalanine, 76410-58-7; boron 10, 14798-12-0; phenylalanine, 3617-44-5, 63-91-2; Antineoplastic Agents; Boron Compounds; Organosilicon Compounds; Phenylalanine","Funding text 1: This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI grant number JP15K21764 and JP20H00331, AMED grant 19ck016469h0001, a grant from Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City grant number TX2021-50-01 and from the Kyoto University?TAE Lifesciences collaboration grant.

Although silicate minerals are the most abundant in rock-forming minerals of concrete aggregates, changes upon irradiation in these minerals are not clearly understood, particularly at high irradiation doses. In this study, tectosilicates, i.e., crystal quartz and two feldspars (albite and microcline), were irradiated with 3 MeV Si2+ to a maximum fluence of 2 × 1016 ions/cm2 (approximately two orders of magnitude higher than amorphization fluence), followed by a step height measurement and nano-indentation to quantify the change in volume and mechanical properties. The results show that the fluence dependence of RIVE is similar in quartz and feldspars, but the mechanism of the expansion differs. In quartz, amorphization is completed at a low fluence, followed by the relaxation of network and cavity formation. In feldspar minerals, amorphization occurs slowly. Subsequently, volume expansion is insignificant after the completion of amorphization.

In this study, the spatiotemporal changes of the flow regime were examined by analysing the long-term daily, monthly, annual and extreme discharges and water levels from 1980 to 2018, supported by further investigation of the long-term annual sediment load (from the 1960s to 2015), river bathymetric data (in 1998, 2014 and 2017) and daily salinity concentration (from the 1990s to 2015) using various statistical methods and a coupled numerical model. Then, the effects of riverbed incision on the hydrology were investigated. The results show that the dry season discharge (i.e., in March–June) of the Tien River increased by up to 23% from the predam period (1980–1992) to the postdam period (1993–2018) but that the dry season water level at My Thuan decreased by up to −46%. The annual mean and monthly water levels in June at Tan Chau and in January and June–October at My Thuan in the Tien River decreased statistically, even though the respective discharges increased significantly. These decreased water levels instead of the increased discharges were attributed to the accelerated riverbed incision upstream from My Thuan, which increased by more than three times, from a mean rate of −0.16 m/year (−16.7 Mm3/year) in 1998–2014 to −0.5 m/year (−52.5 Mm3/year) in 2014–2017. This accelerated riverbed incision was likely caused by the reduction in the sediment load of the VMD (from 166.7 Mt/year in the predam period to 57.6 Mt/year in the postdam period) and increase in sand mining (from 3.9 Mm3 in 2012 to 13.43 Mm3 in 2018). Collectively, the decreased dry season water level in the Tien River is likely one of the main causes of the enhanced salinity intrusion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dam; discharge; flow regime; riverbed incision; salinity intrusion; sand mining; Vietnamese Mekong Delta; water level","Drought; Numerical methods; Rivers; Bathymetric data; Coupled numerical models; Extreme discharges; Flow regimes; Increased discharges; Salinity intrusion; Sediment loads; Spatio-temporal changes; Water levels; bathymetry; dam construction; fluvial geomorphology; hydrological regime; mining; numerical model; river bed; river discharge; saline intrusion; salinity; sediment transport; water level; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam","","","The authors would like to thank the Mekong River Commission and the Vietnamese National Hydro‐Meteorological Data Centre for providing the discharge and water level data.

Two kinds of bioassays for the effects of allelopathic activity on the growth of other plants, i.e., the sandwich assay and the succeeding crop assay, were performed for three transgenic lines and three non-transgenic lines. No significant differences were observed between transgenic and non-transgenic plants. No significant difference in the numbers of cultivable microorganisms analyzed by the spread plate method were observed among the six transgenic and non-transgenic lines.

The UF treated under air formed the needle-like crystals which were assumed to be mullite-related substances formed by transformation of andalusite, because the crystals are mainly composed of SiO2 and Al2O3. In contrast to the UF, the IL did not generate such crystals; however, when the IL was treated under air after carbonization under Ar, crystals appeared. The composition of the UF with an Al/Si ratio higher than that of the IL favored the formation of mullite-related substances, while the presence of lime in the IL inhibited the formation of mullite-related substances. Oldhamite was formed by the reaction of lime with sulfur at the carbonization of the IL under Ar and remained even at the successive air treatment. As lime was consumed, the formation of mullite-related substances was ceased to be inhibited under air after Ar treatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","A part of this work (TEM–EDS) was supported by Nagoya University microstructural characterization platform as a program of “Nanotechnology Platform” of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

The first Faster R-CNN model is trained by using a training set of color images (RGB images). The second model is trained by using grayscale images that represent digital elevation models (DEMs). The results from both models are used to construct features for training a classification decision tree. The resulting bounding-box is selected from the following four classes: the box obtained from the RGB model, the box obtained from the DEM model, the intersection of those two boxes, and the smallest box that contains the union of them. The evaluation results show that the proposed method is better than the RGB model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and Intersectionover-Union (IoU) score.

It can be applied to many applications, such as crack detection, rockfall detection, and glacier movement detection. Traditional DBSCAN requires two predefined parameters. Suitable values of these parameters depend upon the distribution of the input point cloud. Therefore, estimating these parameters is challenging. This paper proposed a new version of DBSCAN that can automatically customize the parameters. The proposed method consists of two processes: initial parameter estimation based on grid analysis and DBSCAN based on the divide-and-conquer (DC-DBSCAN) approach, which repeatedly performs DBSCAN on each cluster separately and recursively. To verify the proposed method, we applied it to a 3D point cloud dataset that was used to analyze rockfall events at the Puiggcercos cliff, Spain. The total number of data points used in this study was 15,567. The experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the traditional DBSCAN in terms of purity and NMI scores. The purity scores of the proposed method and the traditional DBSCAN method were 96.22% and 91.09%, respectively. The NMI scores of the proposed method and the traditional DBSCAN method are 0.78 and 0.49, respectively. Also, it can detect events that traditional DBSCAN cannot detect. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D point cloud; DBSCAN; Divide and conquer; Grid density; Rockfall detection","Crack detection; Parameter estimation; Rock bursts; DBSCAN algorithm; Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Divide and conquer; Glacier movement; Initial parameter estimation; Non-parametric; Number of datum; Spatial clustering; Clustering algorithms","","","This research is supported by Thailand Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (TAIST), National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), and Tokyo Institute of Technology under the TAIST-Tokyo Tech program.

Since the origin and mechanisms by which IgA nephropathy develops currently remain unclear, a confirmed disease diagnosis is currently only possible by highly invasive renal biopsy. With the background of the salivary microbiome as a rich source of biomarkers for systemic diseases, we herein primarily aimed to investigate the salivary microbiome as a tool for the non-invasive diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. In a comparison of salivary microbiome profiles using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, significant differences were observed in microbial diversity and richness between IgA nephropathy patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, recent studies reported that patients with IgA nephropathy are more likely to develop inflammatory bowel diseases and that chronic inflammation of the tonsils triggered the recurrence of IgA nephropathy. Therefore, we compared the salivary microbiome of IgA nephropathy patients with chronic tonsillitis and ulcerative colitis patients. By combining the genera selected by the random forest algorithm, we were able to distinguish IgA nephropathy from healthy controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, from the ulcerative colitis group with AUC of 0.88, and from the chronic tonsillitis group with AUC of 0.70. Additionally, the genus Neisseria was common among the selected genera that facilitated the separation of the IgA nephropathy group from healthy controls and the chronic tonsillitis group. The present results indicate the potential of the salivary microbiome as a biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","IgA nephropathy; Kidney disease; Oral microbiota; Random forest algorithm; Salivary microbiome","adult; area under the curve; bacterium; classification; cohort analysis; dysbiosis; female; genetics; human; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; isolation and purification; Japan; male; microbiology; microflora; middle aged; saliva; young adult; Adult; Area Under Curve; Bacteria; Cohort Studies; Dysbiosis; Female; Glomerulonephritis, IGA; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Middle Aged; Saliva; Young Adult","","","The first author was supported by the Japanese Government through a MONBUKAGAKUSHO (MEXT) Scholarship during her study at Okayama University.

As neuromorphic systems require high integration to form a functional silicon brain-like, moving to 3D integrated circuits (3D-ICs) with three-dimensional network on chip (3D-NoC) interconnect is a suitable approach that allows scalable design, shorter connections, and lower power consumption. However, highly dense neuromorphic systems also encounter the reliability issue where a single point of failure can affect the systems'operation. Because neuromorphic systems rely heavily on spike communication, an interruption or violation in the timing of spike communication can adversely affect the performance and accuracy of a neuromorphic system. This paper presents NASH,a a fault-tolerant 3D-NoC based neuromorphic system that incorporates as processing elements, lightweight spiking neuron processing cores (SNPCs) with spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) on-chip learning. Each SNPC houses 256 leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and 65k synapses. Evaluation results on MNIST classification, using the fault-tolerant shortest-path K-means-based multicast routing algorithm (FTSP-KMCR), show that the NASH system can maintain high accuracy for up to 30% permanent fault in the interconnect with an acceptable area and power overheads when compared to other existing systems.aThis project is supported by the University of Aizu, Competitive Research Funding (CRF), Ref.

The survey enquired about the awareness of biofuel availability in Vietnam, motivations for using biofuel, and willingness to purchase biofuel. It was found that awareness was positively correlated with higher education levels, and that all groups were encouraged by the perceived environmental friendliness of biofuel. In terms of willingness to purchase, there was a clear difference in the perception of the appropriate pricing policy for biofuels between the public groups and the experts, with the former preferring higher prices and the latter lower prices. The study then concludes by discussing policy recommendations for improving consumer demand for biofuels in Vietnam and presents suggestions for future research, if the Vietnamese government decides that it is in its interest to pursue biofuels in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","awareness; Biofuel; public perception; Vietnam; willingness to purchase","Costs; Motivation; Sales; Surveys; awareness; Consumer demands; Environmental friendliness; Higher education; Policy recommendations; Public perception; Questionnaire surveys; Viet Nam; Biofuels","","","The present research is the result of cooperation among three universities: The University of Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, and Vietnam Japan University, under the Global Field Exercise (GFE) course initiated by the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science–Global Leadership Initiative (GPSS-GLI), the University of Tokyo.

Study focus: This paper aims at quantifying the flow regime alterations in the entire Mekong from 1980 to 2015 and linking with the controlling drivers of alterations. In this regard, various indicators, analytical methods, and a semi two-dimensional hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion model were used. New hydrological insights for the region: The flow regime alterations in the high-dam development period (2009–2015) are more pronounced than in the low-dam development period (1993–2008), compared to the no-dam development period (1980–1992), based on most of the indicators analyzed. In the high-dam development period all existing dams with large reservoir capacity seemed to have cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and frequency and increased the low-flow discharge along the entire Mekong through reservoir operations, exceeding climate change effect. In the recent years the water levels in the low-flow season in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) have decreased, possibly because of increased riverbed incision caused by reduced sediment supply and increased sand mining. The reduced water levels together with the increased number of the sluice gates constructed seemed to have increased salinity intrusion in the VMD which may be partly reduced by early emergency water release from upstream dams. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Discharge; Flow regimes; Hydropower dams; Salinity intrusion; The Mekong; Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD)","","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the Mekong River Commission for providing the discharge data at stations upstream of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, which are accessible at http://portal.mrcmekong.org/search .

Our study aimed to investigate the effects of FFMAS in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Methods: We searched systematically in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Registry of clinical trials, WHO registry of clinical trials, clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar until July 2017. Meta-analysis was used to investigate the efficacy and safety outcomes of FFMAS. Following the retrieval of potential articles, two independent reviewers screened and extracted included papers rigorously. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for the individual outcome when data was available. Quality of included studies was assessed using Cochrane collaboration tool. Results: A total of seven randomized controlled trials involving 1198 participants with 3105 oocytes were explored in this study. Most of the studies were at low risk of bias. Our random effects model meta-analyses in maturation and abnormal embryo rate between FFMAS-exposed oocytes compared with controls revealed no significant differences (summary OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.46–2.16, p value = 0.99 and summary OR was 1.31, 95% CI 0.84–2.04, p value = 0.23, respectively). Beside, our study showed a significant increase in uniformly abnormal embryo rate in FFMAS group compared with vehicle control group (summary OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.09–3.61, p value = 0.03). No significances were noted on meta-analyses of normal embryo rate, uniformly abnormal embryo rate, uniformly normal embryo rate, mosaic embryo rate, abnormal blastomere rate, normal blastomere rate, aneuploidy mosaic embryo rate, and chaotic mosaic embryo rate. Conclusions: FFMAS showed no efficacy in maturation process in human oocytes and there was some evidence for detrimental effects in comparison to vehicle controls. We discouraged any further trials due to safety concern. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ART; FFMAS; Infertility; IVM; Meta-analysis","","","","We\u2019re extremely grateful to Mr. Mostafa Abdo Barakat from the Faculty of Medicine, Al-Azhar University, Menoufia City, Egypt & Pratha Taiwade from Smolensk State Medical University, Smolensk City, Russia for their contribution to this study.

However, the methane production efficiency from lignocellulosic biomass is relatively low, mainly due to its refractory components, of which lignin is the major barrier to bioconversion and also resists the hydrolysis of lignocellulose, thus limiting the AD process. This study compared the effects of two different gases (N<inf>2</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf>) nanobubble water (NBW) on methane production from lignin using mono-digestion and co-digestion with acetic acid (HAc) at four different total organic carbon (TOC) ratios of HAc to lignin (97.5%:2.5%, 95%:5%, 90%:10%, and 80%:20%). Results show that N<inf>2</inf>-NBW is the promising NBW which can enhance methane production by 22% compared to the control. In addition, co-digestion of lignin with acetic acid reflects a higher methane production potential in comparison with the mono-digestion of lignin, achieving a much higher methane production (824–1061 mL CH<inf>4</inf>/g-TOC<inf>removed</inf>) when lignin content was less than 20% (TOC basis) and the highest lignin reduction (43%) at the TOC ratio of HAc to lignin of 95%:5%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic digestion; Lignin reduction; Methane production; Nanobubble water","Acetic acid; Biomass; Lignin; Lignocellulosic biomass; Methane; Organic carbon; pH; Substrates; Anaerobic methane; Codigestion; Lignin contents; Methane production; Nano-bubble; Refractory components; Total Organic Carbon; Anaerobic digestion; Acetic Acid; Ph","","","The first author would like to thank the financial support by Japanese Development Scholarship (JDS) during her study at University of Tsukuba, Japan.","J Radiat Res Appl Sci, (2014); Zheng, Yi, Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for enhanced biogas production, Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 42, 1, pp. 35-53, (2014); Zhong, Weizhang, Effect of biological pretreatments in enhancing corn straw biogas production, Bioresource Technology, 102, 24, pp. 11177-11182, (2011); Lignin Trends and Applications, (2018); Hiloidhari, Moonmoon, Crop residue biomass for decentralized electrical power generation in rural areas (part 1): Investigation of spatial availability, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, 4, pp. 1885-1892, (2011); Ge, Xumeng, Solid-state anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass: Recent progress and perspectives, Bioresource Technology, 205, pp. 239-249, (2016); Sivagurunathan, Periyasamy, Fermentative hydrogen production using lignocellulose biomass: An overview of pre-treatment methods, inhibitor effects and detoxification experiences, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 77, pp. 28-42, (2017); Amao, Yutaka, Solar hydrogen production from cellulose biomass with enzymatic and artificial photosynthesis system, Research on Chemical Intermediates, 42, 11, pp. 7753-7759, (2016); Asgher, Muhammad, Alkali and enzymatic delignification of sugarcane bagasse to expose cellulose polymers for saccharification and bio-ethanol production, Industrial Crops and Products, 44, pp. 488-495, (2013); Jang, Min-su, Catalytic upgrading of lignin derived bio-oil model compound using mesoporous solid catalysts, Research on Chemical Intermediates, 42, 1, pp. 3-17, (2016)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V. editorial@springerplus.com","","","","","","09226168; 15685675","","RCINE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089577682"

The SAD was performed using continuously stirred tank reactors. Meanwhile, the TAD experiment was set up using a combined system involving a continuously stirred tank for hydrolysis/acidogenesis and an upflow reactor for methanogenesis. The hydrolytic reactor operated as a batch process with a retention time (RT) of 9 days, while the methane reactor was a continuous process operation with RT of 20 days. Both TAD and SAD were controlled at a temperature of 36 °C. The SAD experiments lasted for 143 days, and were characterised by the kinetic rate constant k = 0.02 day−1 which was much lower than that for the TAD (k = 0.66 − 2.16 day−1). The SAD seemed to be inhibited by high concentration of free ammonia and low inoculum to substrate ratio; herein, only 17.8–22.3% of the initial carbon could be converted into biogas (equivalent to 91–110 Nml/g-VS<inf>added</inf>) with low methane content (44.1–48.7%). Meanwhile, TAD converted 41.67% initial carbon to biogas (equivalent to 299.0–374.6 Nml/g-VS<inf>added</inf>) with high methane content (71.68–81.0%). Moreover, methanogenesis in the TAD was highly stable which enabled the digestion process to return to normal state within a few days, even though the concentrations of the influent increased to double (6.5–24.5 g-COD/l). As per these results, the TAD was much more stable, faster, and stronger than the SAD.

The system is developed based on the VexRiscv Central Processing Unit (CPU) with the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions of RV32IM. Besides the core processor, the System-on-Chip (SoC) contains 8KB of boot ROM, 64KB of on-chip memory, UART controller, SPI controller, timer, and GPIOs for LEDs and switches. The 8KB of boot ROM has 7KB of hard-code in combinational logics and 1KB of a stack in SRAM. The proposed SoC performs the Dhrystone and Coremark benchmarks with the results of 1.27 DMIPS/MHz and 2.4 Coremark/MHz, respectively. The layout occupies 1.32-mm2 of die area, which equivalents to 349,061 of NAND2 gate-counts. The 65-nm SOTB process is chosen not only because of its low-power feature but also because of the back-gate biasing technique that allows us to control the microcontroller to favor the low-power or the high-performance operations. The measurement results show that the highest operating frequency of 156-MHz is achieved at 1.2-V supply voltage (V<inf>DD</inf>) with +1.6-V back-gate bias voltage (V<inf>BB</inf>).

The degrees of freedom are approximated with a truncated generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). The present work depends on the extension of extended finite element method (XFEM) to the stochastic context, containing implicit expression of voids through the random level set functions. A new partition technique is defined to divide the random domain for integration by using a priori knowledge of the void shape function, which can further reduce the computational time.

However, it has not received enough attention in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), i.e., the world’s third largest delta, compared to salinity intrusion and flooding. There have been several studies examining RB and coastal erosion in the VMD using remotely sensed satellite data, but the applied methodology was not adequately validated. Therefore, we developed a novel SRBED (Spectral RB Erosion Detection) method, in which the M-AMERL (Modified Automated Method for Extracting Rivers and Lakes) is proposed, and a new RB change detection algorithm using Landsat data. The results show that NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) using the M-AMERL algorithm (i.e., NDWI<inf>M-AMERL</inf>, MNDWI<inf>M-AMERL</inf>) perform better than other indices. Furthermore, the NDWI<inf>M-AMERL; SMA</inf> (i.e., NDWI<inf>M-AMERL</inf> using the SMA (Spectral Mixture Analysis) algorithm) is the best RB extraction method in the VMD. The NDWI<inf>M-AMERL; SMA</inf> performs better than the MNDWI, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and WNDWI (Weighted Normalized Difference Water Index) indices by 35–41%, 70% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, the NDVI index is not recommended for assessing RB changes in the delta. Applying the developed SRBED method and RB change detection algorithm, we estimated a net erosion area of the RB of –1.5 km2 from 2008 to 2014 in the Tien River from Tan Chau to My Thuan, with a mean erosion width of –2.64 m and maximum erosion widths exceeding 60 m in places. Our advanced method can be applied in other river deltas having similar characteristics, and the results from our study are helpful in future studies in the VMD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Landsat; Remote sensing; River bank detection/extraction; Satellite; Spectral index; Vietnamese Mekong Delta","Banks (bodies of water); Erosion; Signal detection; Change detection algorithms; Erosion detection; Extraction method; Landsat satellite; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference water index; Salinity intrusion; Spectral mixture analysis; Rivers","","","Funding: This research was funded by Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP), the Supporting Program for Interaction-Based Initiative Team Studies SPIRITS 2016 of Kyoto University, and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) projects, grant numbers of VAST05.05/19-20 and KHCBTÐ.02/18-20.","Anthony, Edward Jamal, Linking rapid erosion of the Mekong River delta to human activities, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); van Khanh Triet, Nguyen, Has dyke development in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta shifted flood hazard downstream?, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 21, 8, pp. 3991-4010, (2017); Journal of Japan Society of Civil Engineers Ser B1 Hydraulic Engineering, (2018); Binh, Doan Van, Changes to long-term discharge and sediment loads in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta caused by upstream dams, Geomorphology, 353, (2020); Khoi, Dao Nguyen, Morphological change assessment from intertidal to river-dominated zones using multiple-satellite imagery: A case study of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Regional Studies in Marine Science, 34, (2020); Li, Xing, Recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and the impacts of dams, Earth-Science Reviews, 175, pp. 1-17, (2017); Wang, Jianjun, Sediment load estimates and variations in the Lower Mekong River, River Research and Applications, 27, 1, pp. 33-46, (2011); Tran, D.

Here we report that one of the 12 barley PIPs (PIP1 and PIP2) tested, HvPIP2;8, facilitated cation transport when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. HvPIP2;8-associated ion currents were detected with Na+ and K+, but not Cs+, Rb+, or Li+, and was inhibited by Ba2+, Ca2+, and Cd2+ and to a lesser extent Mg2+, which also interacted with Ca2+. Currents were reduced in the presence of K+, Cs+, Rb+, or Li+ relative to Na+ alone. Five HvPIP1 isoforms co-expressed with HvPIP2;8 inhibited the ion conductance relative to HvPIP2;8 alone but HvPIP1;3 and HvPIP1;4 with HvPIP2;8 maintained the ion conductance at a lower level. HvPIP2;8 water permeability was similar to that of a C-terminal phosphorylation mimic mutant HvPIP2;8 S285D, but HvPIP2;8 S285D showed a negative linear correlation between water permeability and ion conductance that was modified by a kinase inhibitor treatment. HvPIP2;8 transcript abundance increased in barley shoot tissues following salt treatments in a salt-tolerant cultivar Haruna-Nijo, but not in salt-sensitive I743. There is potential for HvPIP2;8 to be involved in barley salt-stress responses, and HvPIP2;8 could facilitate both water and Na+/K+ transport activity, depending on the phosphorylation status. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aquaporins; Barley; Ion transport; Oocytes; Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs)","aquaporin; barium ion; cadmium; calcium ion; cesium ion; divalent cation; lithium ion; magnesium ion; plasma membrane intrinsic protein; plasma protein; rubidium ion; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; calcium; cation; complementary RNA; plant protein; potassium; sodium; water; adult; animal cell; Article; barley; carboxy terminal sequence; cation transport; controlled study; cultivar; electric potential; electrophysiology; female; gene; hvpip2;8 gene; hydroponics; ion current; ion transport; nonhuman; oocyte; potassium conductance; protein phosphorylation; salt stress; shoot; sodium conductance; water permeability; water transport; Xenopus laevis; animal; cell culture; cell membrane; gene expression regulation; genetics; Hordeum; metabolism; patch clamp technique; phosphorylation; Animals; Aquaporins; Calcium; Cations; Cell Membrane; Cells, Cultured; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ion Transport; Oocytes; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Phosphorylation; Plant Proteins; Plant Shoots; Potassium; RNA, Complementary; Sodium; Water","","aquaporin, 215587-75-0; barium ion, 22541-12-4; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; calcium ion, 14127-61-8; cesium ion, 18459-37-5; lithium ion, 17341-24-1; magnesium ion, 22537-22-0; rubidium ion, 22537-38-8; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; water, 7732-18-5; Aquaporins; Calcium; Cations; Plant Proteins; Potassium; RNA, Complementary; Sodium; Water","Funding text 1: This research was founded by Ohara Foundation for Agricultural Science, (to M.K.), and by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as part of the Joint Research Program implemented at the Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University in Japan (2918, 3019, 3118, R220 to T.H.), and the MEXT scholarship (Research Student, to STH.T. and S.I.).

To better understand the expansion behavior, crystal SiO<inf>2</inf> was irradiated by 2 MeV He and 3 MeV Si ions at 44 °C, 92 °C and 142 °C, following step height measurement to quantify the volume change. The amorphization was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. We found that even after the amorphization has fully occurred, the volume expansion continued at higher dose, and irradiation temperature enhanced the expansion rate. To describe the volume change in amorphized SiO<inf>2</inf>, we have developed an empirical model based on the Poisson law, considering the contribution of collision and ionization process, and estimated that the critical dose for swelling in alpha-SiO<inf>2</inf> was about 0.11 dpa (displacements per atom). The viscous flow effect, whose activation energy has been estimated as 0.13 eV in our study, could play an important role in swelling especially after the amorphization, which can explain the slower swelling process induced by neutron irradiation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorphization; Concrete degradation; Irradiation defects; Stress relaxation","Activation energy; Aggregates; Amorphization; Concrete aggregates; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Silica; Silicon; Swelling; Displacements per atoms; Expansion behavior; Ionization process; Irradiation temperature; Step height measurement; Structural concretes; Swelling mechanism; Volume expansion; Neutron irradiation","","","A part of this study was the results from the \u201CJapan Concrete Aging Management Program on Irradiation Effects (JCAMP)\u201D sponsored by METI in Japan.

This study aims at investigating the modernization of its entire swine-to-pork value chain. Design/methodology/approach: This study combines the secondary data and primary data. The secondary data included the publications, procurements, databases from both worldwide and in Vietnam. Primary data comprised the results from field-trips in March 2018 and February 2019 that used in-depth interviews with representative key persons of involving stake-holders. Findings: The prevalence of contract farming, vertical expansion and conglomerate mergers mainly boost vertical coordination in the industry, which creates three hierarchy paradigms of governance named the full- and semi-vertically integrated model, and the formal coordinating relation institution. Consequently, consolidation has occurred and lead the swine and pork value chain toward modernization. Research limitations/implications: This study generalizes its first trends of the modernization of the swine-to-pork industry instead of provides its concreted impacts to the involved stakeholders. Social implications: Swine and pork industries retain historical and socio-political issues in Vietnam. Social problems are going to raise if number of traditional swine producers are failed in the competition from the equipped large-scale producers leading by the giant vertically-integrated contractors. Originality/value: This study provides the empirical synthesis of the vertical coordination in entitle swine and pork value chain of Vietnam through combining the view of the strategic alliance of the firm and global value chain governance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consolidation; Contract farming; Coordination; Pig; Pork; Value chain; Vertical integration; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: Authors would like to especially thank the anonymous reviewers for the constructive comments this manuscript.

This study demonstrates a comprehensive and geographically transferable approach to produce a 12 category high-resolution land use/land cover (LULC) map over mainland Vietnam in 2016 by remote sensing data. The map included several natural forest categories (evergreen broadleaf, deciduous (mostly deciduous broadleaf), and coniferous (mostly evergreen coniferous)) and one category representing all popular plantation forests in Vietnam such as acacia (Acacia mangium, Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia hybrid), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), and others. The approach combined the advantages of various sensor data by integrating their posterior probabilities resulting from applying a probabilistic classifier (comprised of kernel density estimation and Bayesian inference) to each datum individually. By using different synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (PALSAR-2/ScanSAR, PALSAR-2 mosaic, Sentinel-1), optical images (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) and topography data (AW3D30), the resultant map achieved 85.6% for the overall accuracy. The major forest classes including evergreen broadleaf forests and plantation forests had a user's accuracy and producer's accuracy ranging from 86.0% to 95.3%. Our map identified 9.55 × 106 ha (±0.16 × 106 ha) of natural forests and 3.89 × 106 ha (±0.11 × 106 ha) of plantation forests over mainland Vietnam, which were close to the Vietnamese government's statistics (with differences of less than 8%).

We previously reported that, in leaf palisade cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, mitochondria exhibit blue-light-dependent redistribution together with chloroplasts, which conduct accumulation and avoidance responses under the control of blue-light receptor phototropins. In this study, precise motility analyses by fluorescent microscopy revealed that the individual mitochondria in palisade cells, labeled with green fluorescent protein, exhibit typical stop-and-go movement. When exposed to blue light, the velocity of moving mitochondria increased in 30 min, whereas after 4 h, the frequency of stoppage of mitochondrial movement markedly increased. Using different mutant plants, we concluded that the presence of both phototropin1 and phototropin2 is necessary for the early acceleration of mitochondrial movement. On the contrary, the late enhancement of stoppage of mitochondrial movement occurs only in the presence of phototropin2 and only when intact photosynthesis takes place. A plasma-membrane ghost assay suggested that the stopped mitochondria are firmly adhered to chloroplasts. These results indicate that the physical interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts is cooperatively mediated by phototropin2- and photosynthesis-dependent signals. The present study might add novel regulatory mechanism for light-dependent plant organelle interactions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","angiosperm; cell organelle; chloroplast; mitochondrion; photosynthesis; protein; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis protein; phototropin; Arabidopsis; fluorescence microscopy; genetics; mesophyll cell; metabolism; physiology; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chloroplasts; Mesophyll Cells; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Mitochondria; Photosynthesis; Phototropins","","Arabidopsis Proteins; Phototropins","We are grateful to Professor Hirokazu Tsukaya, University of Tokyo for his kind donation of and phototropin mutants.

A total of 100 trajectories are investigated, in which a H2O molecule is set to strike the surface with a translational energy of 1 eV or 2 eV. The results show that the NiAs2 monolayer is an excellent candidate for the activation of water splitting with a reaction probability of 94% for both energy levels. Interestingly, the kinetics of two O-H dissociation stages varies greatly with respect to the inletting translational energy. Interpreting the reaction data for the 1 eV case, we conclude that O-H1 and O-H2 dissociations are first-order processes. However, such dissociation steps become pseudo-zeroth order in the 2 eV case. At the time of the dissociation, the force acting on atoms and the principal component analysis suggest that the two OH breaking stages behave like harmonic springs until reaching the dissociation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Arsenic compounds; Dissociation; Kinetics; Molecular dynamics; Monolayers; Nickel compounds; Probability; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; First-order process; H2O molecules; Harmonic springs; Reaction probability; Translational energy; Water splitting; Reaction kinetics","","","The authors are grateful for the support of computational resources from the Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University Center for Computational Materials Science.

We examine the case of a rubber plantation in an ethnic minority area in the Northwest of the country. In doing so, the paper seeks to address how the Vietnamese socialist State – often considered a ‘strong state’ because it has pursued egalitarian land distribution policies over the past three decades – proceeds with domestic land grabbing in a context where the local people follow customary land use practices. The field research revealed the following. First, the Vietnamese government, while maintaining land distribution policies for its rural farming population, has increasingly sought to bring these policies more in line with the global trend of large-scale land acquisition at the expense of the traditional interests and livelihoods of the local population. By seeking to justify their essentially non-egalitarian land grab processes through the policy of post-land grab ‘egalitarian land re-distributions’ in areas with disembedded customary control, the domestic state actors deployed a cunning duplicity in their persistent adherence to agrarian egalitarianism. Second, with the supports from the local and central governments, a state-owned enterprise named Vietnam Rubber Group, carved out its land grab processes with more freedom, leverage, and power than similar firms investing abroad through land concessions. Last, the post-land grab redistribution of land rights materializes state formation through re-territorialization of and re-legalization within the frontier zone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestic land grab; Egalitarian land distribution; Rubber plantation; State-owned enterprise; Vietnam","land management; land rights; land use planning; plantation; policy approach; rubber; state owned enterprise; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the Vietnamese Government for providing scholarship to the first author’s Ph.D. program at the Kyushu University.

The primary purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting consumer trust in brands of safe vegetables. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling technique was applied to test the hypothetical relationships based on a sample of 361 consumers from a face-to-face interview in the urban areas of Hanoi city, Vietnam, in March and April 2018. Findings: The authors' findings show that both brand credibility and brand reputation positively affected brand trust. The trustworthiness of a safe vegetable system had a more important role than the competence in building brand trust. While the effects of system trustworthiness on brand trust were found directly and indirectly (through brand credibility), system competence only had an indirect influence on brand trust via brand reputation. Notably, while risk recall directly reduced brand trust, risk information caused a directly positive effect on brand trust. In addition, the impact of food hazards on brand trust was indirect through brand credibility. Practical implications: Based on our results, the Vietnamese government and stakeholders in the safe vegetable chain should improve brand trust based on fulfilling comprehensive traceability, expanding the brand reputation and providing an appropriate risk communication strategy to the public. Originality/value: This study is one of the first attempts to model and evaluate factors affecting brand trust in the food sector directly and indirectly. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand credibility, brand reputation; Brand trust; Risk perception; Safe vegetables; System trustworthiness","article; consumer; government; human; interview; perception; recall; structural equation modeling; trust; urban area; vegetable; Viet Nam","","","This study was supported by QR program, Kyushu University, Japan.We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.","International Business Research, (2010); Bai, Li, Understanding the antecedents of organic food purchases: The important roles of beliefs, subjective norms, and identity expressiveness, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 11, (2019); Berg, Lisbet, Trust in food safety in Russia, Denmark and Norway, European Societies, 7, 1, pp. 103-129, (2005); Boccia, Flavio, Genetically modified food versus knowledge and fear: A Noumenic approach for consumer behaviour, Food Research International, 111, pp. 682-688, (2018); Structural Equation Modeling with Amos Basic Concepts Applications and Programming, (2010); Calvo-Porral, Cristina, Food private label brands: the role of consumer trust on loyalty and purchase intention, British Food Journal, 118, 3, pp. 679-696, (2016); Chen, Mei Fiang, Consumer trust in food safety - A multidisciplinary approach and empirical evidence from Taiwan, Risk Analysis, 28, 6, pp. 1553-1569, (2008); de Jonge, Janneke, Monitoring consumer confidence in food safety: An exploratory study, British Food Journal, 106, pp. 837-849, (2004); de Jonge, Janneke, Understanding consumer confidence in the safety of food: Its two-dimensional structure and determinants, Risk Analysis, 27, 3, pp. 729-740, (2007); de Jonge, Janneke, How trust in institutions and organizations builds general consumer confidence in the safety of food: A decomposition of effects, Appetite, 51, 2, pp. 311-317, (2008)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","0007070X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085768964"

Dissociating these very stable amyloid plaques is a critical clinical issue. In this study, we present a joint mid-infrared free electron laser experiment/nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation to understand the dissociation process of a representative example GNNQQNY fibril. By tuning the laser frequency to the amide I band of the fibril, the resonance takes place and dissociation is occurred. With the calculated and observed wide-angle X-ray scattering profiles and secondary structures before and after laser irradiation being identical, we can propose a dissociation mechanism with high confidence from our simulations. We find that dissociation starts in the core of the fibrils by fragmenting the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and separating the peptides and then propagates to the fibril extremities leading to the formation of unstructured expanded oligomers. We suggest that this should be a generic mechanism of the laser-induced dissociation of amyloid fibrils. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Amides; Electrons; Free electron lasers; Glycoproteins; Hydrogen bonds; Molecular dynamics; Neurodegenerative diseases; Peptides; X ray scattering; Amyloid proteins; Dissociation mechanisms; Dissociation process; Generic mechanism; Intermolecular hydrogen bonds; Laser-induced dissociation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Secondary structures; Dissociation; amyloid; peptide; dissociative disorder; human; laser; protein secondary structure; Amyloid; Dissociative Disorders; Humans; Lasers; Protein Structure, Secondary","","amyloid, 11061-24-8; Amyloid; Peptides","This work has been supported by the Department of Science and Technology at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (Grant 13/2020/H-QPTKHCN), the Initiative d\u2019Excellence program from the French State (Grant DYNAMO, ANR-11-LABX-0011-01, and CACSICE, ANR-11-EQPX-0008), and the National Institutes of Health (R01-GM079383, R21-GM097617, and P30-DA035778).

The present study aimed to investigate clinical, gross, histopathological and immunohistochemical features of HS in eight hedgehogs. Histological and immunohistochemical features of normal histiocytes and Langerhans cells (LCs) of hedgehogs were also investigated. HLA-DR-, Iba-1- and E-cadherin-positive LCs were observed in the epidermis, while Iba-1- and CD204-positive histiocytes were detected in the lymph nodes and spleen of normal hedgehogs. Localized HS (six cases) developed in the skin and spleen, while disseminated HS (two cases) occurred in the intestine. Tumour cells of disseminated HS were also distributed within the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, kidney, spleen, lung and adrenal glands. Tumour cells of both localized and disseminated HS were composed of histiocytic cells, spindle to pleomorphic cells, multinucleated giant cells and erythrophagocytic cells. Most tumour cells were immunopositive for Iba-1, CD204 and lysozyme. A small number of tumour cells were positive for E-cadherin and CD208, and the tumour cells in one case were positive for HLA-DR. These results suggest that the tumour cells have variable features of histiocyte origin, including dendritic cells, LCs and macrophages. The behaviour of HS in the hedgehog was very aggressive, and 50% of cases died within 90 days of resection. The present study also highlighted the tendency for local tumour recurrence in localized cutaneous HS cases, suggesting a requirement for a long-term follow-up after excision. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","four-toed hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris); histiocytic sarcoma; immunohistochemistry; Langerhans cell","calcium binding protein; dendritic cell lysosome associated membrane protein; HLA DR antigen; ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1; lysozyme; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; adrenal metastasis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; antigen detection; Article; Atelerix; Atelerix albiventris; cancer localization; cell differentiation; cellular distribution; clinical feature; controlled study; dendritic cell; epidermis; erythrophagocytosis; female; follow up; giant cell; histiocyte; histiocytic sarcoma; histopathology; human; immunohistochemistry; kidney metastasis; Langerhans cell; liver metastasis; long term care; lung metastasis; lymph node; lymph node metastasis; male; mesentery lymph node; nonhuman; priority journal; skin metastasis; spindle cell; spleen; spleen metastasis; tumor recurrence","","lysozyme, 9001-63-2; uvomorulin, 112956-45-3","The authors thank Ms. S.

We demonstrate and validate the cost effectiveness and utility of the MIG-seq workflow in obtaining useful and robust sequence data from aged museum specimens. We applied the MIG-seq approach to 55 aged (10 - 23 years old) millimeter-sized dry-mounted specimens of the hyper-diverse ant genus Pheidole. A total of 50,782,736 reads were generated from the 55 samples (259,902 - 3,693,375 reads per sample). The reads corresponded to 36,862 SNPs from 4,849 polymorphic loci; the SNP dataset was then used to construct a Bayesian phylogenetic tree. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was highly compatible with existing knowledge of phylogenetic relationships among species of Pheidole. Therefore, we recommend the MIG-seq method as a cost-effective and highly applicable pipeline for conducting phylogenetic and population genetic studies on aged museum specimens, potentially enhancing the relevance of specimen repositories in general towards modern biodiversity science and conservation biology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Insecta; Museomics; Next-Generation Sequencing; Phylogenetics; SNP detection","","","","We thank Seiki Yamane and Fuminori Ito for providing us valuable specimens.

However, the effectiveness of these piles in a realistic environment has yet to be scientifically proven, and there have been no established design guidelines for this type of improvised coastal protection to date. This study focuses on Phan Thiet City, Vietnam, where local people are resorting to wooden piles to mitigate severe coastal erosion immediately in front of their houses. A 3D hydrodynamic modelling with irregular waves is applied to evaluate complex wave mechanisms and hydrodynamics around and between wooden piles. The complicated interaction mechanisms between incident and reflected waves cannot be adequately evaluated using a common 2D numerical model or mathematical analysis, demonstrating the benefit of using a 3D hydrodynamic model. The performance of wooden piles are simply assessed using two criteria: wave run-up and bending stress. The result shows that wooden piles installed at a severely eroded beach in Vietnam can reduce wave run-up on the beach slope to some extent. The reduction in wave run-up occurs because of the creation of turbulence and oscillation triggered by the partial reflection of waves on the piles, diverting water flows into various directions. A case study shows that wave pressure in the seaward direction is about a half of that in the shoreward direction. However, the pressure in the negative direction can be instantaneously increased due to a significant reflection from a steep shore. This paper discusses whether such a state-of-the art computational fluid dynamics model can contribute to the assessment of wooden pile breakwaters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D hydrodynamic modelling; Coastal erosion; Community-based coastal protection; Phan Thiet; SDGs; Stability of wooden piles; Supercomputer; Vietnam; Wave run-up; Wooden pile breakwaters","breakwater; coastal erosion; coastal protection; computational fluid dynamics; local participation; stability analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; three-dimensional modeling; wave runup; wood; Viet Nam","","","This research was funded by a grant awarded to Tokyo Institute of Technology (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, 16KK0121 and 19K04964).","Van Cuong, Chu, Using Melaleuca fences as soft coastal engineering for mangrove restoration in Kien Giang, Vietnam, Ecological Engineering, 81, pp. 256-265, (2015); Dalrymple, Robert Anthony, Water wave scattering by rows of circular cylinders, pp. 2216-2228, (1988); Integrated Coastal Management in the Province Ca Mau Vietnam, (2015); Esteban, Miguel, Storm Surge and Tsunami Awareness and Preparedness in Central Vietnam, pp. 321-336, (2014); Esteban, Miguel, Handbook of Coastal Disaster Mitigation for Engineers and Planners, pp. 1-765, (2015); Marit Policy Manag, (2019); Esteban, Miguel, Adaptation to sea level rise on low coral islands: Lessons from recent events, Ocean and Coastal Management, 168, pp. 35-40, (2019); Esteban, Miguel, Adaptation to sea level rise: Learning from present examples of land subsidence, Ocean and Coastal Management, 189, (2020); Wave Forces on A Vertical Circular Cylinder Experiments and A Proposed Method of Wave Force Computation, (1964); Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures, (1985)","","Springer editorial@springerplus.com","","","","","","18747841; 14000350","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085690214"

Biocontrol of foodborne pathogens by lytic bacteriophages garners increasing interest from both researchers and food industry. In the present study, 29 phages against S. aureus were successfully isolated from chicken, pork, and fish. Characterization of the isolates revealed that phage SA46-CTH2 belonging to Podoviridae family had a number of features suitable for food industry applications such as wide host range, short latent period, large burst size, high stress tolerance, and a genome free of virulence genes. Furthermore, phage SA46-CTH2 alone or in combination with nisin exhibited great efficacy in reducing planktonic and biofilm cells of S. aureus at various conditions tested. The combination of phage SA46-CTH2 and nisin was also found to be able to inhibit the regrowth of S. aureus at both 37 and 24 °C. Key points • A total of 29 S. aureus phages were successfully isolated from fish, pork, and chicken products. • Phage SA46-CTH2 was characterized by host range, morphology, and genome sequencing. • SA46-CTH2 significantly reduced both planktonic and biofilm cells of S. aureus. • Combination of SA46-CTH2 and nisin inhibited the regrowth of S. aureus. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacteriophage; Bio-control; Biofilm; Staphylococcus aureus","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacteriophages; Biofilms; Fish; Food microbiology; Heat resistance; Meats; Biofilm cells; Food industries; Food-borne pathogens; Genome sequencing; Heat-stable enterotoxin; High stress; Resistance to antibiotics; Virulence gene; Staphylococcus aureus; genomic DNA; nisin; antibiotics; bacteriophage; biofilm; cell component; genome; inhibition; pathogen; regrowth; virulence; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; chicken; controlled study; fish; growth inhibition; host range; latent period; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plankton; Podoviridae; pork; stress; virus genome; virus isolation; animal; drug effect; food control; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; procedures; Staphylococcus phage; virology; Animals; Chickens; Fishes; Food Microbiology; Genome, Viral; Host Specificity; Nisin; Pork Meat; Staphylococcus Phages; Virulence","GENBANK: MK764384","nisin, 1414-45-5; Nisin","The authors would like to thank Kyushu University, MEXT, and Kao Corporation for their supports.","Abatángelo, Virginia, Broad-range lytic bacteriophages that kill Staphylococcus aureus local field strains, PLOS ONE, 12, 7, (2017); Bacteriophage, (2011); Ackermann, Hans Wolfgang, Phage classification and characterization., Methods in Molecular Biology, 501, pp. 127-140, (2009); Altschul, Stephen F., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs, Nucleic Acids Research, 25, 17, pp. 3389-3402, (1997); Alves, Diana R., Combined use of bacteriophage K and a novel bacteriophage to reduce Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 80, 21, pp. 6694-6703, (2014); Asao, Tsutomu, An extensive outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning due to low-fat milk in Japan: Estimation of enterotoxin A in the incriminated milk and powdered skim milk, Epidemiology and Infection, 130, 1, pp. 33-40, (2003); Azeredo, Joana Cecília Valente De Rodrigues, The use of phages for the removal of infectious biofilms, Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, 9, 4, pp. 261-266, (2008); Azimirad, Masoumeh, Infection with enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus as a concern in patients with gastroenteritis, Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance, 9, pp. 111-114, (2017); Aziz, Ramy Karam, The RAST Server: Rapid annotations using subsystems technology, BMC Genomics, 9, (2008); Balciunas, Eduardo Marcos, Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review, Food Control, 32, 1, pp. 134-142, (2013)","","Springer","","","","","","01757598; 14320614","","AMBID","32248441","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084654360"

As a result, the country has an extensive disaster risk database that consists of different hazard and risk maps to be used as reference in creating development plans. However, some communities are in relatively low risk zones, such as those in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan (with many inhabitants of the city believing it to be safe). This study seeks to ascertain how disaster risk is understood in coastal areas that are only slightly susceptible to natural hazards, in order to provide strategies to improve disaster risk governance. The study validated national data on coastal disaster risk through a topographical survey, questionnaire surveys, and group interviews (in March 2016 and 2017) to understand whether residents knew the risks they are exposed to. The research found that national data reflects local conditions but community members do not have a clear understanding of the risks, particularly coastal hazards. Moreover, the research found that there has been a recent disaster event, though it was not properly archived and transmitted to the next generation. Thus, there is a need to raise awareness to correctly explain and transmit knowledge about potential hazards even in communities that have relatively lower disaster risk. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Awareness; Coastal communities; Palawan; Storm Surge; Tsunami","","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of the ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net) for their support of this research through the “Coastal disasters and climate change in Southeast Asia: An assessment and countermeasures for sustainable development of the fast-growing coastal areas” project.

However, despite the frequency and intensity with which such messages are being broadcasted throughout the world's media, there is little actual evidence of any relocation actually taking place, even though there are a number of past examples of relative sea level rise due to earthquake induced subsidence or groundwater extraction. Thus, in order to better understand the consequences of future sea level rise the authors analysed four instances of land subsidence that have taken place in the 20th and early 21st centuries (namely, adaptation strategies around Tokyo and Jakarta, and the experience of islands on the Danajon bank in the Philippines, and Kepulauan Seribu close to Jakarta). In all cases the inhabitants of densely populated coastal areas remain in place, despite the challenge of living with higher water levels. Adaptation was done through a five-phase process, starting with the construction of rather weak seawalls, which is then followed by the placement of pumps to drain water. Eventually, as the economic and technical capacities of coastal settlements improved, better seawalls were built, which then led to the reclamation of new areas, the elevation of entire districts or the construction of super levees. Thus, while it is clear that sea level rise will pose an additional financial strain on urbanised coastal areas, the authors found no evidence that any major coastal settlements will surrender a significant portion of its land area to the sea, given the range of adaptation options available. Rather, the opposite is true, and evidence indicates that new lines of defence will be built further into the water, effectively meaning that humans will encroach on the sea. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Climate change; Coastal zones; Groundwater; Retaining walls; Subsidence; Water levels; Adaptation strategies; Coastal communities; Coastal settlement; Groundwater extraction; Land subsidence; Relative sea level rise; Sea level rise; Technical capacity; Sea level; adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone management; earthquake; sea level change; subsidence; water level; Indonesia; Jakarta; Java; Philippines; Thousand Islands [West Java]; Tokyo; West Java","","","Funding text 1: Funding for this research was partially supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number 16KK0121, Tokyo Institute of Technology) and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-14) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan.

Meanwhile, the different blocks of the Indochina composite terranes were still separated by branches of the Proto-Tethys. Sino-Vietnam and part of Indochina amalgamated along the Proto-Song Ma suture by the end of the Early Cambrian. (2) During the Middle Cambrian-Early Ordovician mega-episode, shallow shelf carbonate deposition prevailed north of the Proto-Song Ma suture with associated strata containing a rich benthic fauna. This contrasts with deep marine and volcanic arc setting in the south of the Proto-Song Ma suture. (3) The Middle Ordovician-Silurian mega-episode was characterized by subduction of the Tam Ky-Phuoc Son Ocean beneath the Viet-Lao terrane in the north and the Kon Tum terrane in the south. This was followed by a collisional orogeny that sutured the Kon Tum terrane with the Viet-Lao and Viet-Cambodia terranes along the Tam Ky-Phuoc Son suture. The hypothetic Po Ko and Chu Sinh sutures are discussed. The collision led to an intra-continental orogeny in the Sino-Vietnam composite terrane. By the end of the mega-episode, a unified Sino-Vietnam-Indochina super-terrane was established. During the latest Silurian-Early Devonian, benthic fauna and flora of the Sino-Vietnam and Indochina composite terranes shared Cathaysian affinity. (4) The Devonian-Tournaisian mega-episode was characterized by an Early-Middle Devonian transgression and a Late Devonian-Earliest Carboniferous regression, except for parts of northern Indochina where deep marine conditions remained. (5) During the Visean-Middle Permian, the Song Ma ocean reopenned in the north of Indochina. Meanwhile in the west, a volcano-plutonic belt formed due to eastward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys under the Indochina composite terrane. (6) The Late Permian-Early Triassic mega-episode was characterized by Emeishan mantle plume related continental rifting, and the Indosinian orogeny resulting from resuturing of the Indochina and Sino-Vietnam composite terranes along the Song Ma suture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Indochina composite terrane; Paleozoic tectono-stratigraphy; Sino-Vietnam composite terrane; Song Ma suture; Tam Ky-Phuoc Son suture","depositional environment; Ordovician; paleoenvironment; subduction; suture zone; tectonic evolution; tectonic setting; tectonostratigraphy; Triassic; Indochina; Viet Nam","","","We are deeply indebted to Prof. Clive Burrett for his detailed and valuable comments and suggestions.

We examined the impacts of dams in the MR basin on changes to the long-term discharge and sediment loads from upstream of dams in China (e.g., Jiuzhou) to the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) at daily, monthly, and annual scales over a 55-yr period (1961–2015) using various statistical methods. Results revealed sediment trapping in the Lancang cascade dams. To clarify the consequences of the reduced MR sediment load on morphological changes in the VMD, bathymetric data measured in 2014 and 2017 were examined along 100 km of the Tien river. The results show significantly reduced suspended sediment loads at all stations in the lower MR, but the sediment loads at Jiuzhou was increased. Thus, the reduced sediment load is caused not by a reduced sediment supply from the upper MR basin but by sediment trapping in the Lancang cascade dams. The sediment was reduced by 74.1% in the VMD; 166.7 ± 33.3 Mt/yr occurred in the predam period and 43.1 Mt/yr occurred in 2012–2015, with 40.2% caused by six mainstream dams in the Lancang cascade. Therefore, the Tien river in the VMD was severely incised, with an incision rate of −0.5 m/yr in 2014–2017. Upstream development has caused large-scale morphological changes in the VMD. Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of 14.8% of the annual riverbed incision in the VMD, while the remainder was caused by upstream hydropower dams. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hydropower dams; Mekong River; Sediment load; Vietnamese Mekong Delta","","","","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP) and the Supporting Program for Interaction-Based Initiative Team Studies SPIRITS 2016 of Kyoto University , Japan.; Funding text 2: This work was funded by the Japan-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Platform (JASTIP) and the Supporting Program for Interaction-Based Initiative Team Studies SPIRITS 2016 of Kyoto University, Japan.","Adamson, Peter T., The Hydrology of the Mekong River, pp. 53-76, (2009); Allison, Mead A., Bottom morphology in the Song Hau distributary channel, Mekong River Delta, Vietnam, Continental Shelf Research, 147, pp. 51-61, (2017); Allison, Mead A., Sedimentation and survival of the Mekong delta: A case study of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise, Oceanography, 30, 3, pp. 98-109, (2017); Anthony, Edward Jamal, Linking rapid erosion of the Mekong River delta to human activities, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Journal of Japan Society of Civil Engineers Ser B1 Hydraulic Engineering, (2018); J Jpn Soc Civil Eng Ser B1 Hydraul Eng, (2018); Echogeo, (2013); Brunier, Guillaume, Recent morphological changes in the Mekong and Bassac river channels, Mekong delta: The marked impact of river-bed mining and implications for delta destabilisation, Geomorphology, 224, pp. 177-191, (2014); Darby, Stephen E., Decoding the drivers of bank erosion on the Mekong river: The roles of the Asian monsoon, tropical storms, and snowmelt, Water Resources Research, 49, 4, pp. 2146-2163, (2013); Darby, Stephen E., Fluvial sediment supply to a mega-delta reduced by shifting tropical-cyclone activity, Nature, 539, 7628, pp. 276-279, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","0169555X","0416325904; 9780416325904","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077644291"

We here evaluated PCDH17 mRNA expression in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ALL. PCDH17 mRNA expression levels in children with ALL/AML were lower than those in healthy counterparts. We next elucidated the mechanism underlying down-regulation of PCDH17 mRNA, using myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines. Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in restoration of PCDH17 mRNA expression and growth inhibition in K562, HL60, REH, and RCH-ACV cell lines. Upregulation of PCDH17 mRNA expression resulted from histone H3 acetylation. Knockdown of the PCDH17 gene, caused by transduction of PCDH17-targeted shRNA, significantly enhanced the proliferation of KU812 cells. Meanwhile, overexpression of PCDH17 via retroviral-particle transfection substantially inhibited the growth of Kasumi1 cells. The fold-increase in PCDH17 mRNA expression mediated by 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, was fundamentally lower than that produced by TSA. In conclusion, our results suggest that PCDH17 gene functions as a common tumor suppressor gene in leukemic cells, and that histone deacetylase inhibitors re-express PCDH17 mRNA to a greater extent than demethylation reagents. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DNA methylation; Histone acetylation; Leukemia; PCDH17 gene; Protocadherin","azacitidine; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; histone H3; messenger RNA; trichostatin A; cadherin; histone; protocadherin 17, human; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; CpG island; down regulation; HEK293T cell line; histone acetylation; HL-60 cell line; human; human cell; K-562 cell line; Kasumi-1 cell line; Ku812 cell line; lymphoid leukemia cell line; mRNA expression level; open reading frame; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; promoter region; protocadherin 17 gene; RCH-ACV cell line; real time polymerase chain reaction; Reh cell line; tumor suppressor gene; upregulation; acetylation; acute disease; cell culture; DNA methylation; gene expression; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; physiology; preschool child; tumor cell line; Acetylation; Acute Disease; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cells, Cultured; Child, Preschool; DNA Methylation; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Histones; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; RNA, Messenger; Transcription, Genetic","","azacitidine, 320-67-2, 52934-49-3; trichostatin A, 58880-19-6; histone, 9062-68-4; Cadherins; Histones; protocadherin 17, human; RNA, Messenger","Funding text 1: We acknowledge Dr. Kafri T (University of North Carolina, NC, USA) for providing pcDNAVSV-G, Dr. Kitamura (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) for providing pMXs-puro and gagpol-IRES-brs.

This study examines the role of system trust and brand trust in forming consumer trust in the safety of “safe vegetables”, which is the official term used by the Vietnamese government to indicate vegetables certified as safe, in Vietnam. Besides, the impact of consumer worry about vegetable safety – a major problem in Vietnam – on the trust in the safety of safe vegetables is also evaluated. Based on a sample of 361 randomly chosen consumers from the urban districts of Hanoi, we deployed structural equation modeling to explore the factors associated with consumer trust in the safety of safe vegetables. Our main results show that brand trust plays the most vital role in building consumer trust in safe vegetables. In addition to the direct effect, brand trust also acts as a mediator between system trust and trust in the safety of safe vegetables. Interestingly, consumer worry about vegetable safety has two opposite effects on trust in safe vegetables: a direct negative impact and an indirect positive impact through brand trust. Based on the results, we propose important recommendations for improving consumer trust in safely branded food products in general, and safe vegetables in particular in Vietnam. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brand trust; Consumer trust; Food safety; Safe vegetables; System trust; Vietnam","","","","This work was supported by the QR program at Kyushu University, Japan .

The main aim of this study is to investigate the hydrogeochemical characteristics and their influencing factors in a coastal area of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam (MD). A total of 286 groundwater samples were taken from shallow and deep aquifers for analyzing major ions and stable isotopes. The results show that deep groundwater is dominated by Ca–HCO<inf>3</inf>, Ca–Na–HCO<inf>3</inf>, Ca–Mg–Cl, and Na–HCO<inf>3</inf> while shallow groundwater is dominated by the Na–Cl water type. In this region, the main geochemical processes controlling groundwater chemistry are ion exchanges, mineralization and evaporation. Groundwater salinization in coastal aquifers of the Mekong Delta is caused by (1) paleo-seawater intrusion and evaporation occurring in the Holocene and Pleistocene aquifers, (2) dissolution of salt sediment/rock and leakage of saline from upper to lower aquifers due to excessive groundwater exploitation and hydraulic connection. High nitrate concentrations in both shallow and deep aquifers are related to human activities. These results imply that groundwater extraction may exacerbate groundwater quality-related problems and suitable solutions for sustainable groundwater management in the coastal area of the Mekong Delta are needed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coastal superposed aquifers; Field investigation; Hydrogeochemical processes; Mekong Delta; Multivariate statistical analysis","coastal aquifer; hydrogeochemistry; multivariate analysis; saline intrusion; stable isotope; water chemistry; water quality; water supply; water-rock interaction; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; ground water; isotope; nitric acid derivative; sea water; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; salinity; spatiotemporal analysis; water pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Isotopes; Nitrates; Salinity; Seawater; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Vietnam; Water Pollution, Chemical","","Isotopes; Nitrates","We are grateful to the Japanese Government scholarships (JDS and MEXT) and the University of Tsukuba for their supports for this study.

Several cis-acting elements have been identified in filamentous fungi; however, the fundamental requirements for basic promoter function in basidiomycetes are obscure. In this study, core elements in β<inf>1</inf>-tubulin promoters of basidiomycetes were functionally characterized. Using transient transformation in Ceriporiopsis subvermispora as a promoter assay, we found that a 14-bp region (β<inf>1</inf>-tubulin core promoter element, BCE), as well as CT-rich stretch, in the β<inf>1</inf>-tubulin promoter of the species played a critical role in the expression of a recombinant hph as a reporter gene. In addition, in silico analysis revealed other members of basidiomycetes also harboured the BCE motif as well as CT-rich stretch in the β<inf>1</inf>-tubulin promoter region, suggesting their functional conservation among the species of basidiomycetes. To confirm the function of BCE, we investigated the effects of BCE motif deletion in the Pleurotus ostreatus β<inf>1</inf>-tubulin promoter on expression levels of a recombinant luminous shrimp luciferase reporter gene, which was targeted into the Pofcy1 locus. Intriguingly, luciferase activity was abolished when the BCE motif was deleted in the β<inf>1</inf>-tubulin promoter, strongly demonstrating its essential function in transcription from this promoter on the chromosome. This study clearly demonstrates the crucial role of the BCE as well as the CT-rich stretch regions in the β<inf>1</inf>-tubulin promoter among basidiomycetes and provides new insights into the fundamental mechanism of transcription initiation in this group. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Basidiomycetes; Ceriporiopsis subvermispora; Core promoter element; Pleurotus ostreatus; Transient transformation; β1-tubulin gene","beta1 tubulin; cis acting element; complementary DNA; TATA binding protein; tubulin; unclassified drug; Article; Basidiomycetes; Ceriporiopsis subvermispora; controlled study; fungal genome; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic manipulation; genetic transcription; homologous recombination; hph gene; luciferase assay; nonhuman; plasmid; Pleurotus ostreatus; pofcy1 gene; priority journal; promoter region; shrimp; start codon; transcription initiation; biology; conserved sequence; gene expression regulation; genetics; nucleotide motif; nucleotide sequence; position weight matrix; procedures; reporter gene; Base Sequence; Basidiomycota; Computational Biology; Conserved Sequence; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Reporter; Nucleotide Motifs; Plasmids; Position-Specific Scoring Matrices; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Tubulin","","Tubulin","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Noda Institute for Scientific Research (to Y.

The phylogenetic position of the genus had been uncertain until recent molecular phylogenetic studies strongly supported the genus to be the most basal lineage in the cryptic subterranean subfamily Leptanillinae. In the present study, we examine the morphology of the worker, queen, male, and larva of the only species in the genus, Opamyrma hungvuong Yamane, Bui & Eguchi, 2008, based on colonies newly collected from Guangxi in China and Son La in Vietnam, and provide descriptions and illustrations of the male, larva, and some body parts of the worker and queen (including mouthparts, tentorium, and sting apparatus) for the first time. The novel morphological data, particularly from the male, larva, and sting apparatus, support the current phylogenetic position of the genus as the most basal leptanilline lineage.

First, we seek to establish whether Japan’s focus on quality manufacturing was a conscious choice. Second, we attempt to analyse the impact of the external environment on the success/failure of quality upgrading. Third, we investigate whether Japanese businesses, regardless of the shifts in the competitive environment in the last two decades, continue to explore quality management as a strategic weapon for competitiveness. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study is based on a systematic literature review using two of the main scientific databases - JSTOR and Emerald. The scientific papers used for this synthesis - over sixty manuscripts in total - have (predominantly) focused on the quality movement in Japan at a national/country level. These are peerreviewed articles published between 1980 and 2018 that go beyond the field of operations/quality management. Research findings: We show that Japan’s focus on quality upgrading was a conscious choice that sought to elevate the country’s economy. Moreover, we identify a number of external factors (e.g. government support, sound formal institutions) - four, specifically - that, according to our analysis, have been critical to Japan’s success in quality manufacturing. Finally, we show that regardless of the (recent) shifts in the competitive environment, (product) quality improvement continues to take a central part in Japan’s pursuit of global economic dominance. Theoretical contribution/Originality: We claim that that this is the first comprehensive study of Japan’s quality movement to include scientific data from the Meiji Period until the present day (so far the bulk of the scientific papers have focused on the quality movement in post-war Japan). We also bridge a substantial gap in the QM literature regarding the influence of the external environment (e.g. political factors, social factors) on the success/failure in quality upgrading. Practitioner/Policy implication: The insights of this paper provide a valuable lesson to policy makers from developing and/or underdeveloped economies in their pursuit of economic growth.

For example, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) established an international project called Intelligent Manufacturing System (IMS), which aimed at integrating production facilities including robots and skillful human capital. At the same time, the government retained controlled of the industrial activity – in 1985, over 40 per cent of the industry was regulated by the government, with some sectors including mining, construction, and insurance being almost 100 per cent regulated (Hitomi, 1992). Besides the support from formal institutions, the Japanese government offered backing through other means including financial intervening. For instance, according to Smith (1993), between 1985 and 1989, the Finance Ministry deliberately inflated the property and securities market to offset the increasing value of the Japanese yen against the US dollar, which started hurting exports. This move sought to maintain the provision of bank funds for Japanese businesses.; Funding text 2: Japan).

Rice plants were exposed to exogenous ethylene (1 ppm) after simulated herbivory, which consisted of mechanical wounding supplemented with oral secretions (WOS) from the generalist herbivore larva Mythimna loreyi. Ethylene treatment highly suppressed VOCs in WOS-treated rice leaves, which was further corroborated by the reduced transcript levels of major VOC biosynthesis genes in ethylene-treated rice. In contrast, the accumulation of jasmonates (JA), known to control VOCs in higher plants, and transcript levels of primary JA response genes, including OsMYC2, were not largely affected by ethylene application. At the functional level, flooding is known to promote internode elongation in young rice via ethylene signaling. Consistent with the negative role of ethylene on VOC genes, the accumulation of VOCs in water-submerged rice leaves was suppressed. Furthermore, in mature rice plants, which naturally produce less volatiles, VOCs could be rescued by the application of the ethylene perception inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene. Our data suggest that ethylene acts as an endogenous suppressor of VOCs in rice plants during development and under stress. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Defense; Ethylene; Gene expression; Herbivory; Rice (Oryza sativa); Volatile organic compounds","","","","Funding text 1: We thank Atsushi Miyake (Okayama University) for help with development of GC-MS methods used for volatile measurements; Dr Hideyuki Matsuura (Hokkaido University) for providing deuterated jasmonate standards for LC-MS/MS; Dr Yasutaka Kubo (Okayama University) for providing 1-MCP; and Dr David Wari for checking the manuscript.This work was supported by Ohara Foundation and JSPS KAKENHI Grants (No. 24570026 and 16K08143 to IG, No. 18K05558 to TS).

The model was applied to collective drainage basins of the lake’s Imazu (northwest), Hikone (northeast), and Otsu (south) areas. The hourly model was conducted using particular discharges from Kita (Ado) river, Takatoki (Ane) river, and Yasu River to obtain loading curves for phosphate (PO<inf>4</inf>) and silica (SiO<inf>2</inf>) by assimilating measured concentrations (2002–2003). The tank model was updated by adding an evapotranspiration routine and direct paths of groundwater discharges to the lake floor. The daily model was calibrated through analysis of water budget among the basin, inflow, lake and outflow, and then validated. The model was established and combined into a loading-discharge curve to determine the long-term external nutrient loadings entering the lake (1980–2017). Seasonal variation in nutrient loadings increased during spring and summer and decreased during winter.

The circuit is fabricated using 65 nm Silicon on Thin Buried Box (SOTB) CMOS technology. The measurement result shows that the circuit exceeds 1000 mV DC output at –14 dBm input power and obtains 48 % power conversion efficiency (PCE) at a level of –10 dBm input power. The proposed circuit generated 0.9 µW DC output power at a level of –21 dBm input power which is equivalent to 10.6 % PCE when harvesting the 950 MHz LTE signal in the ambient environment. The study also indicates the effect of the phase difference between the two RF input signals on the DC output voltage in a CMOS CCR. The DC output voltage depends on the phase of the two RF input signals and reaches a maximum when the phase difference between the two RF signals is π. Experimental results demonstrate that the output voltage changes from 950 mV to –100 mV when the phase difference varies from π to 0 at an RF input power of –10 dBm. When the rectifier receives an RF signal from the environment at an input power of –21 dBm, the DC output voltage changes from 300 mV to –50 mV when the phase difference changes from π to 0. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","65 nm SOTB; Cross-Coupled Rectifier; DTMOS; Phase Difference; RF Energy Harvesting","","","","This work was supported by JST-CREST Grant Number JPMJCR16Q1.

Regular updates to injury burden assessments are critical. We report Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Study estimates on morbidity and mortality for all injuries. methods We reviewed results for injuries from the GBD 2017 study. GBD 2017 measured injury-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. To measure non-fatal injuries, GBD 2017 modelled injury-specific incidence and converted this to prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs). YLLs and YLDs were summed to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Findings In 1990, there were 4 260 493 (4 085 700 to 4 396 138) injury deaths, which increased to 4 484 722 (4 332 010 to 4 585 554) deaths in 2017, while age-standardised mortality decreased from 1079 (1073 to 1086) to 738 (730 to 745) per 100 000. In 1990, there were 354 064 302 (95% uncertainty interval: 338 174 876 to 371 610 802) new cases of injury globally, which increased to 520 710 288 (493 430 247 to 547 988 635) new cases in 2017. During this time, age-standardised incidence decreased non-significantly from 6824 (6534 to 7147) to 6763 (6412 to 7118) per 100 000. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised DALYs decreased from 4947 (4655 to 5233) per 100 000 to 3267 (3058 to 3505). Interpretation Injuries are an important cause of health loss globally, though mortality has declined between 1990 and 2017. Future research in injury burden should focus on prevention in high-burden populations, improving data collection and ensuring access to medical care. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","global disease burden; global health; human; incidence; injury; life expectancy; morbidity; mortality; quality adjusted life year; Global Burden of Disease; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Life Expectancy; Morbidity; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Wounds and Injuries","","","Funding text 1: 651Medical Physics Department, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran 652Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA 653School of International Development and Global Studies, University of Ottawa, OttawaON, Canada 654Health Services Management Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran 655Department of Health Management, Policy and Economics, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran 656Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China 657Department of Social Work and Social Administration, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China 658School of Allied Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 659Department of Psychopharmacology, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo, Japan 660Department of Sociology, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea 661Department of Health Policy & Management, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS, USA 662School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China 663Department of Environmental Health, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran 664Department of Environmental Health, Academy of Medical Science, Sari, Iran 665School of Public Health and Management, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China 666Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China 667Global Health Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China 668Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Ardabil University of Medical Science, Ardabil, Iran 669Department of Epidemiology, University Hospital of Setif, Setif, Algeria 670Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia 671Student Research Committee, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran 672Department of Community Medicine, Ardabil University of Medical Science, Ardabil, Iran 673Department of Environment Health Engineering, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran 674Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Health Education, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran 675Department of Preventive Medicine, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China 676School of Public Health, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China 677Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Occupational Hazard Identification and Control, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China 678Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India, Gurugram, India 679National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia 680Department of Community Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka 681Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK acknowledgements Syed Aljunid acknowledges the Department of Health Policy and Management, Faculty of Public Health, Kuwait University and International Centre for Casemix and Clinical Coding, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Malaysia and for the approval and support to participate in this research project.

The Gnamptogenys taivanensis group (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ectatomminae) is a species-group that contains eight described species known from southern China, Taiwan, and northern Vietnam. The taxonomy of the group remains poorly understood due to limited morphological evidence (mostly relying on the morphology of the worker caste), the complete lack of molecular evidence, as well as poor sampling effort: most of the species except G. taivanensis have so far been known only from one or two localities in southern China each, and are allopatric to each other. However, our recent collection of many colonies of G. taivanensis group from three localities (Tay Con Linh, Phia Oac-Phia Den, and Hoang Lien Son) in the northern mountainous region of Vietnam showed remarkable diversity in the external morphology of workers, even within a single locality. The present study thus aims to explore species delimitation of the G. taivanensis group in the region using a combination of phylogenetic and morphometric analyses. Phylogenetic analyses for the genome-wide sequence datasets generated by MIG-seq and morphometric analysis using Nest-Centroid (NC) clustering consistently recovered seven major lineages of the G. taivanensis group (six Vietnamese and one Taiwanese lineages), with four singleton colonies for which these analyses yielded inconsistent and complex pictures. Moreover, the sympatric occurrence of the two or three lineages in each of the three localities of northern Vietnam is indirect evidence of the presence of reproductive isolation among these lineages. These lines of evidence strongly support heterospecificity of the lineages. However, phylogenetic analysis for mitochondrial COI gene showed an almost incompatible pattern with these lineages, possibly due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgressive hybridisation. A future comprehensive study on a larger geographic scale is needed to clarify the placement of the singleton colonies and conduct a formal taxonomic revision of the group. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",". ant; Multiplexed ISSR genotyping by sequencing; Next-generation sequencing; Taiwan; Vietnam","","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Nguyen Van Sinh (Director of IEBR), Truong Xuan Lam (IEBR), Bui Tuan Viet (Hanoi, Vietnam), and the directors and staffs of the Hoang Lien Son National Park, Phia Oac - Phia Den National Park, and Tay Con Linh Nature Reserve for their kind assistance in our field surveys.

Due to the limitation of public finances, the private sector is invited to participate in infrastructure project development. The private sector can entirely or partially invest in an infrastructure project in the form of a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme, which has been an attractive option for several developing countries, including Vietnam. Unfortunately, despite the PPP scheme will improve project efficiencies and attract capital investments of private investors, the success of PPP implementation is not guaranteed. This paper investigates the critical success factors (CSFs) of PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam. Relevant data were collected through in-depth interviews with six PPP experts and questionnaire surveys with 150 interviewees and then analyzed by the word cloud technique and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The CSFs were ranked based on the viewpoints of the public sector, the private sector, and the PPP consultants. The outcomes show that there was no significant difference in the perceptions of all three parties concerning the success factors for PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam. The top five critical success factors are (1) timely land acquisition and appropriate compensation, (2) financial capacity of the private sector, (3) effective project management, (4) favorable and complete legal framework and regulations, and (5) financial feasibility and attraction. Recognizing the CSFs is indispensable to ensure the success of PPP infrastructure project implementation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Critical success factor (CSF); Infrastructure projects; Public-private partnership (PPP); Vietnam; Word cloud technique","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the AUN/SEED-Net (JICA), Chulalongkorn University (Thailand), Kyoto University (Japan), and Ho Chi Minh City Open University (Vietnam) for their financial supports for this research.","Chan, Albert P.C., Exploring critical success factors for partnering in construction projects, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 130, 2, pp. 188-198, (2004); Asean Engineering Journal, (2016); Giang, Dang T.H., Critical factors affecting the efficient use of public investments in infrastructure in Vietnam, Journal of Infrastructure Systems, 21, 3, (2015); Chan, Albert P.C., Critical success factors for PPPs in infrastructure developments: Chinese perspective, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 136, 5, pp. 484-494, (2010); Build Operate Transfer Paving the Way for Tomorrow S Infrastructure, (1996); Rintala, Kai, Organizing a bidding competition for a toll road concession in South Africa: The case of chapman's peak drive, Journal of Management in Engineering, 24, 3, pp. 146-155, (2008); Fernandes, Carlos, PPPs — True Financial Costs and Hidden Returns, Transport Reviews, 36, 2, pp. 207-227, (2016); Chan, Albert P.C., Public private partnerships in international construction: Learning from case studies, pp. 1-190, (2014); Hamid, Azlina Abd, Client's readiness assessment success factors for outsourcing software projects, International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 6, 6, pp. 820-827, (2016); Zammani, Mazlina, An empirical study of information security management success factors, International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 6, 6, pp. 904-913, (2016)","","Insight Society ijaseit@insightsociety.org","","","","","","20885334; 24606952","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084844248"

Reducing waste sent to landfill has become an emerging mission in Vietnam. This study aims at assessing cost-effective solutions to reduce waste-to-landfill amount using system analysis approach. A single-objective optimisation model is formulated to minimise the cost of the system in association with different landfill waste reduction targets and values of waste separation efficiency for Hoi An city. As a result, the landfill target is directly proportional to the cost. It means the higher landfill reduction target leads to the higher cost of the system. Meanwhile, the separation efficiency is inversely proportional to the system cost. The result showed that twenty-five percent of municipal waste treated in landfills is achievable target based on the current condition of the city. Also, ten percent of municipal waste sent to landfill is an infeasible mission if the waste separation rate is too low. If waste is wholly separated at source, incineration, composting and landfill can be applied as main treatment alternatives to reduce seventy-five percent of municipal waste sent to landfill with the cost of about 1,800 USD/d. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The research is funded and supported by Okayama University, Japan.

Currently, most research focuses on improving membrane performance, both in terms of permeability and selectivity. Only a few studies have paid attention to how the membrane module is configured and operated. In this study, the geometric design and operating conditions of a membrane module are considered as multivariable optimization variables. The objective function is the annual cost. The cost consists of a capital investment depending on the plant scale and an operating expense associated with energy consumption. In the optimization problem, the channel dimensions (width × length × height), and operating conditions (the inlet pressure and recirculation flow rate) were considered as decision variables. The operating configuration of the membrane plant is assumed to be feed and bleed mode, and a model including the pressure drop is introduced. The model is used to simulate the membrane plant and calculate the membrane area and energy usage, which are directly related to the total cost. The genetic algorithm is used for the optimization. The effect of individual parameters on the total cost is discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-flow; Membrane module; Modeling; Optimization; Protein solution; Ultrafiltration","","","","The authors would like to thank Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Tokyo Institute of Technology for the kind support during the preparation of the manuscript.","Mores, Patricia, Membrane-based processes: Optimization of hydrogen separation by minimization of power, membrane area, and cost, Processes, 6, 11, (2018); Ramírez-Santos, Álvaro Andres, Optimization of multistage membrane gas separation processes.

Methods: The 22-items version of the JCQ was used. This includes four scales: (a) psychological demands (5 items); (b) job control (9 items); (c) supervisor support (4 items); and (d) coworker support (4 items). All 1258 nurses in a general hospital in Vietnam, excluding 11 who were due to retire, were invited to complete the cross-sectional survey. The internal consistency reliability was estimated using Cronbach's α. Construct validity was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Convergent validity was evaluated by calculating correlations between the JCQ scores and DASS 21 and overtime work. Results: In total, 949 (75%) of the 1258 eligible nurses completed the survey. Cronbach's α values demonstrated acceptable internal consistency in two scales (supervisor support α =.87; coworker support α =.86), while Cronbach's α was below the acceptable threshold of 0.70 for job control (α =.45) and job demand (α =.50). EFA assuming a four-factor structure showed a factor structure that was almost identical to the original JCQ, with two items loading on other scales. The subscales of depression, anxiety, and stress response of DASS 21 and the subscales of JCQ were significantly correlated, as expected. Conclusion: The results suggest that the JCQ in Vietnamese can be used with some reliability and validity for examining psychosocial work environment among nurses. Further studies should be done to confirm and expand our findings in a variety of occupational groups and in other Asian low- and middle-income countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","job contents questionnaire; job strain; psychometric properties; reliability; validity","anxiety; article; construct validity; controlled study; convergent validity; coworker; Cronbach alpha coefficient; exploratory factor analysis; general hospital; human; internal consistency; middle income country; nursing staff; questionnaire; stress; Viet Nam; work environment; adult; cross-sectional study; female; job satisfaction; male; mental stress; occupational health; psychology; reproducibility; social support; translating (language); workplace; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Occupational Health; Reproducibility of Results; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating; Vietnam; Workplace","","","Funding text 1: Approval of the research protocol : This study was approved by The Research Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine/Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo (no. 11991\u2010(1)), and the Ethical Review Board for Biomedical Research, Hanoi University of Public Health (no 346/2018/YTCC\u2010HD3) regarding research protocol.

The ionic ordering of Na<inf>x</inf>Mo<inf>3</inf>S<inf>11</inf> in the ground-state structures is determined by the DFT method. During the intercalation process of Na ions, we find that the Na<inf>x</inf>Mo<inf>3</inf>S<inf>11</inf> structure exhibits a two-step reaction pathway involving both cationic and anionic redox reactions for Mo and S, respectively. In the first step, an initial anionic redox (S<inf>2</inf>)2- → S2- (1 ≤ x ≤ 4) occurs, while in the second step, both anionic and cationic redoxes of (S<inf>2</inf>)2- → S2- and Mo4+ → Mo3+ (4 < x ≤ 17) occur simultaneously. In total, the Na<inf>x</inf>Mo<inf>3</inf>S<inf>11</inf> electrode can store up to 17 Na ions with a predicted capacity of 711 mA h/g. Moreover, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed during the cationic/anionic redox due to the appearance of mid-gap states. Mo<inf>3</inf>S<inf>11</inf> thus is predicted to be a promising one-dimensional polymer electrode for the sodium-ion battery. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Density functional theory; Electrodes; Ground state; Metal ions; Molybdenum compounds; Polymers; Redox reactions; Sodium-ion batteries; Ground-state structures; Intercalation process; Ionic order; Molybdenum sulfide; One-dimensional polymers; Polymer electrodes; Semiconductor-to-metal transitions; Two-step reactions; Sulfur compounds","","","N.T.H. acknowledges the financial support from the Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Tohoku University, and thanks Dr. Quang Duc Truong for the fruitful discussions.

For 168 Dy, a previously unreported isomer with a half-life of 0.57(7) \u03BCs has been identified at an excitation energy of 1378 keV, and its presence affirmed independently using \u03B3 - \u03B3 - \u03B3 coincidence data taken with Gammasphere via two-proton transfer from an enriched 170 Er target performed at Argonne National Laboratory. This isomer is assigned J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) based on the measured transition strengths, decay patterns, and the energy systematics for two-quasiparticle states in N = 102 isotones. The underlying mechanism of two-quasiparticle excitations in the doubly midshell region is discussed in comparison with the deformed QRPA and multi-quasiparticle calculations. In 169 Dy, the B ( E 2 ) value for the transition de-exciting the previously unreported K \u03C0 = ( 1 / 2 \u2212 ) isomeric state at 166 keV to the K \u03C0 = ( 5 / 2 \u2212 ) ground state is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the E 2 strength for the corresponding isomeric-decay transition in the N = 103 isotone 173 Yb, suggesting the presence of a significant \u03B3 -vibrational admixture with a dominant neutron one-quasiparticle component in the isomeric state. One of the fundamental and universal features of nuclear systematics observed across the chart of nuclides is that the nucleus incurs a deviation from the spherical equilibrium shape when increasing the proton/neutron valency moving away from the magic numbers. Rare-earth (RE) isotopes in the mass range from 150 to 180 are known to be well deformed even in their low-lying states. Despite the predicted smooth variation of axial deformation as a function of the proton number ( Z ) or neutron number ( N ) in the doubly midshell region [1\u20134] , there are some irregularities in the systematics of the observed first 2 + energies for even-even RE nuclides: local minima emerge at N = 98 for 62 Sm, 64 Gd, 66 Dy and at N = 104 for Dy, 68 Er, 70 Yb isotopes (see Fig. 30 in Ref. [5] ). This anomalous behavior of the 2 + energy has been discussed in terms of deformed sub-shell closures [6,7] , which can stabilize the nuclear deformation and thereby have a significant impact on the formation of the so-called RE element peak around A = 165 in the r -process solar abundance distribution [8,9] . The presence of energy gaps in the deformed single-particle space should also influence the excitation spectra in well-deformed nuclei, which are characterized by rotational and vibrational motion, as well as by other non-collective excitations like K isomers ( K denotes the angular momentum projection on the symmetry axis of the deformed nucleus). The competition between such different intrinsic excitations makes the excited level structure more complicated than a simple coupling scheme predicts, due to possible configuration mixing. To provide a good testing ground for more advanced nuclear structure models that can be incorporated in any r -process network simulations, detailed spectroscopic studies of the excited states in this largely deformed region are highly demanded. In this Letter, we present previously unreported isomeric states and their decay properties identified in 168 Dy 102 and 169 Dy 103 , which correspond to double- and single-hole systems relative to the valence maximum nucleus 170 Dy located at the double midshell Z = 66 and N = 104 . The presence of isomers with half-lives of the order of several tens of nanoseconds or longer often facilitates exploration of exotic nuclei produced in fragment separators by measuring delayed \u03B3 -rays that are coincident with the identified particles on an event-by-event basis [10] , as demonstrated recently for a number of neutron-rich RE isotopes at the Radioactive-Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) [11\u201317] . Besides the usefulness to populate excited levels, characteristic isomers can serve as an effective probe for the underlying nuclear structure, such as single-particle orbitals, pairing correlations, and collective motions [18] . Thus, the present work can provide a significant insight into the structure of midshell nuclides that were hard to reach previously. We have analyzed experimental data obtained from two independent experiments; one using the EURICA spectrometer at RIBF [19] , and the other using the Gammasphere array at Argonne Tandem-Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) facility [20] . At RIBF, neutron-rich nuclides around A = 170 were produced by in-flight fission of a 238 U 86+ beam at 345 MeV/u with an average intensity of 12 pnA, incident on a 5-mm thick Be target. The nuclei of interest were separated and identified through the in-flight separator BigRIPS [21] . Identification of particles with the atomic number ( Z ) and the mass-to-charge ratio ( A / Q ) was achieved on the basis of the \u0394 E -TOF- B\u03C1 method, in which the energy loss (\u0394 E ), time of flight (TOF), and magnetic rigidity ( B\u03C1 ) were measured using the focal-plane detectors on the beam line. In total about 1500, 9000, 3600, and 1700 ions were collected for 168 Dy 66+ , 168 Dy 65+ , 169 Dy 66+ , and 169 Dy 65+ , respectively, all of which were involved in the present data analysis. The identified particles were implanted into WAS3ABi [19] , which consisted of two double-sided silicon-strip detectors (DSSSD) stacked compactly. Each DSSSD had a thickness of 1 mm with an active area segmented into 60 and 40 strips (1-mm pitch) on each side in the horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively. The DSSSDs also served as detectors for electrons following \u03B2 -decay and internal conversion processes [22] . Gamma rays emitted following the heavy-ion implantation and their subsequent radioactive decay were detected by the EURICA \u03B3 -ray spectrometer [19,23] , consisting of 12 Cluster-type detectors, each of which contained seven HPGe crystals packed closely. More detailed information on the experimental setup and data analysis can be found in Ref. [5] . In the experiment at ATLAS, excited states in 168 Dy were populated via two-proton removal from an 170 Er target, bombarded by a 136 Xe beam at 830 MeV. The target was composed of a 6 mg/cm 2 metallic foil, enriched in 170 Er, and placed on a gold backing with a thickness of 25 mg/cm 2 , thick enough to stop the reaction products at the target position. Under these conditions, the effective beam energy ranges from about 20% above the Coulomb barrier at the entrance to near the barrier at the rear of the target. Gamma rays were detected with the Gammasphere array [20] . More detailed descriptions of the experimental conditions are presented in Ref. [24] . Gamma-ray coincidence measurements with a requirement that three or more Ge detectors fired, in conjunction with pulsed beams separated by 825 ns, complemented the results obtained at RIBF for isomers with half-lives in the nanosecond to microsecond range. The level schemes of , where the levels assigned different 168 Dy and 169 Dy established in the present work are displayed in Fig. 1 K \u03C0 quantum numbers are described in different colors. The reader is referred to the online version of this article. Prior to the present work, the excited states of . In this analysis for isomeric-decay transitions, however, the 227-keV 168 Dy had been studied by the \u03B2 decay of 168 Tb [27] and multi-nucleon transfer reactions with a 82 Se beam incident on an 170 Er target [28] . The \u03B3 rays at energies of 75 and 173 keV, which were previously assigned as ( 2 1 + ) \u2192 0 1 + and ( 4 1 + ) \u2192 ( 2 1 + ) , respectively, have been confirmed in delayed coincidence with 168 Dy ions in the EURICA experiment, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) \u03B3 ray reported in Ref. [27] and the yrast E 2 sequence above the ( 4 1 + ) state of the ground-state rotational band identified in Ref. [28] have not been observed, due presumably to the difference in feeding pattern. Meanwhile, two previously unreported \u03B3 rays at 915 and 236 keV can be unambiguously seen in Fig. 2 (a). The coincidence spectrum with a double gate on the 915- and 236-keV \u03B3 rays in the Gammasphere data [ Fig. 2 (c)] clearly exhibits \u03B3 rays at 111 and 152 keV, both of which are also visible in the low-energy part of the EURICA spectrum magnified in Fig. 2 (b). Further analyses of the \u03B3 - \u03B3 - \u03B3 cubes reveal that the 111- and 152-keV transitions are not in mutual coincidence. Therefore, these transitions are placed in parallel with each other on top of the 236-915-keV cascade. Another previously unreported \u03B3 ray at 40 keV, which can be distinguished from the intense Dy K \u03B1 -X rays, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b), is assigned as feeding the 111-keV transition, since its energy perfectly matches the gap between the 152- and 111-keV \u03B3 rays. Similarly, a 348-keV \u03B3 ray, which was weakly populated in the EURICA experiment [see Fig. 2 (a)], is placed in parallel with the 111- and 236-keV transitions. In the EURICA experiment, \u03B3 rays following the \u03B2 decay of 168 Tb have also been observed with higher statistics than in Ref. [27] . The results of the \u03B2 - \u03B3 analysis will be presented elsewhere [26] . Here, for the sake of identification of the isomeric state in 168 Dy, we use only the fact that the 915-keV \u03B3 ray is coincident with the 75-keV \u03B3 ray, but not with the 173-keV one [see Fig. 2 (d)], thus being assigned as feeding the ( 2 1 + ) state. An apparent \u03B2 feeding to the 990-keV state from the parent nucleus 168 Tb, which is expected to have a ground-state spin and parity of ( 4 \u2212 ) with the \u03C0 3 / 2 + [ 411 ] \u2297 \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] configuration [27] , allows for a tentative assignment of J \u03C0 = ( 3 \u2212 ) [26] . Note that the ( 4 \u2212 ) assignment for 168 Tb is based on the consideration of the spins and parities, as well as the corresponding Nilsson orbits, assigned to the respective ground states of the neighboring odd- A Tb isotopes and N = 103 isotones [27] . The negative-parity level in 168 Dy is a candidate for the J \u03C0 = 3 \u2212 member of the K \u03C0 = 2 \u2212 octupole-vibrational band, which is known to emerge at comparatively low excitation energies (\u22721.2 MeV) in even- A Dy isotopes with A = 160 \u2212 166 and 170 [14,29] . On the basis of the arguments presented above, a new isomeric state is identified at an excitation energy of 1378 keV in . It should be noted that, despite the observation of the 173-keV 168 Dy. A half-life of 0.57(7) \u03BCs has been derived from a log-likelihood fit of the summed \u03B3 -ray gated time spectra for the isomeric-decay transitions, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (a). The efficiency-corrected \u03B3 -ray intensities ( I \u03B3 ) relative to the 236-keV line are summarized in Table 1 \u03B3 ray, any other \u03B3 rays which feed the ( 4 1 + ) state can not be found in Fig. 2 (a). If only one transition (e.g. an 1130-keV \u03B3 ray from the isomer) populated the ( 4 1 + ) state, the total transition intensity ( I tot ) would be balanced with the following 173-keV transition, yielding a peak area with \u223C10 counts at the corresponding energy, enough to be observed in Fig. 2 (a). Therefore, the non-observation of such connecting \u03B3 rays implies that the ( 4 1 + ) state is populated via several transitions following the decay of the 1378-keV isomeric state. For N = 102 isotones, J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) isomers had been identified in 68 170 Er ( E x = 1269 keV, T 1 / 2 = 43 ns) [24] and 70 172 Yb (1641 keV, 0.5 ns) [31] , while J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 6 \u2212 ) isomers identified in 64 164 Sm (1486 keV, 0.6 \u03BCs), 66 166 Gd (1601 keV, 0.95 \u03BCs) [11] , 68 170 Er (1591 keV, 4.0 ns) [24] , 70 172 Yb (1550 keV, 3.6 \u03BCs) [32] , and 72 174 Hf (1714 keV, 0.45 ns) [33] . The known K \u03C0 = ( 6 \u2212 ) isomers decay either directly or indirectly towards the 6 + state in the ground-state rotational band [29] . For 168 Dy, since the previously reported ( 6 1 + ) \u2192 ( 4 1 + ) transition of 268 keV [28] is not visible in Fig. 2 (b) in spite of sufficiently low backgrounds, the 1378-keV isomeric state is unlikely to have K \u03C0 = 6 \u2212 , and therefore, assigned K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) . The intensity of the 40-keV \u03B3 ray is compared to the sum of the total intensities of the subsequent 111- and 348-keV transitions in order to evaluate the total conversion coefficient \u03B1 T . For all combinations of possible multipolarities of the 111- and 348-keV transitions, being either E 1, M 1, or E 2, the deduced values of \u03B1 T are in agreement only with a theoretical prediction for an E 1 multipole character ( \u03B1 T cal = 0.65 [30] ) within experimental errors. Therefore, the 40-keV transition is assigned as an E 1 branch from the isomeric state at 1378 keV. The hindrance factor F W , the inverse of the transition strength in Weisskopf units (W.u.), is evaluated to be 3.8 ( 19 ) \u00D7 10 5 for the 40-keV E 1 transition. This value is consistent with those reported for the K i \u03C0 = 4 \u2212 \u2192 K f \u03C0 = 3 + ( \u0394 K = 1 ) transitions in the heavier N = 102 isotones 170 Er and 172 Yb [34] , supporting the J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) assignment for the 1378-keV isomeric state, which decays towards the K \u03C0 = ( 3 + ) level at 1338 keV. As will be discussed later, the K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) and ( 3 + ) states in 168 Dy are dominated by the \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] \u2297 \u03BD 7 / 2 + [ 633 ] and \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] configurations, respectively. Therefore, the K -allowed E 1 transition between them is most likely ascribed to the single-neutron transition via \u03BD 7 / 2 + [ 633 ] \u2192 \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] with the 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] neutron being a spectator. For the K \u03C0 = 7 / 2 + and 5 / 2 \u2212 levels at low excitation energy in the neighboring even- Z , N = 101 and 103 nuclei, the corresponding E 1 transitions are known to occur with hindrances F W of the order of 10 5 \u2212 10 6 [29] , being consistent with the value obtained for the ( 4 \u2212 ) \u2192 ( 3 + ) transition in 168 Dy. This consistency in the transition strengths also supports the assignments for the K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) and ( 3 + ) states. The 1227-keV state prefers to decay towards the 990-keV state rather than the ground-state rotational band at lower excitation energy, implying that the 236-keV transition is of a fast E 1 character. Such kind of \u201Cinterband\u201D E 1 transitions have been known to take place between the K \u03C0 = 2 + ( \u03B3 ) and K \u03C0 = 2 \u2212 (octupole) bands in the lighter even- A Dy isotopes [29] . Therefore, the 1227-keV state is expected to have either J \u03C0 = 3 + or 4 + with K \u03C0 = 2 + , which is populated via the 152-keV, E 1 transition from the J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) isomeric state. The E 1 hindrance F W is about two orders of magnitude larger for the 152-keV branch than for the 40-keV transition, the other isomeric-decay branch towards the K \u03C0 = ( 3 + ) state at 1338 keV (see Table 1 ). This is most likely ascribed to the difference in the K quantum number of the states to which the K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) isomer decays. Based on the consideration of the observed feeding pattern and hindrance, the 1227-keV state is associated with the K \u03C0 = ( 2 + ) \u03B3 -vibrational band. The energy systematics of the . They appear at excitation energies approximately equal to the pairing gap, 2 J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 3 + ) , ( 4 \u2212 ) , and ( 6 \u2212 ) states observed for the N = 102 isotones with Z = 62 \u2212 72 are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3 \u0394 \u223C 1.5 MeV, in this mass region, being characteristic of two-quasiparticle (2qp) excitations in even-even nuclei that involve Nilsson orbits \u03A9 \u03C0 [ N n z \u039B ] near the Fermi surface. It should be noted that a K \u03C0 = 6 \u2212 state has not been identified for 168 Dy in the present work. That level is expected to emerge at around 1.6 MeV from the energy systematics, and to preferentially decay towards the lower-lying K \u03C0 = 4 \u2212 band with a short lifetime, as found for 170 Er ( T 1 / 2 = 4 ns) [24] , being presumably hard to observe with the present experimental sensitivity. For 169 Dy, no spectroscopic information had been reported before the present work. Fig. 2 (e) exhibits a \u03B3 -ray energy spectrum measured in coincidence with the identified 169 Dy ions within 0.35 \u2212 6 \u03BCs. A single \u03B3 ray observed at 166 keV can be interpreted as an E 2 transition arising from a J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 1 / 2 \u2212 ) isomer towards the presumed ( 5 / 2 \u2212 ) ground state [see Fig. 1 (right)], in analogy with those identified before in the heavier N = 103 isotones, 171 Er ( E x = 199 keV, T 1 / 2 = 210 ns), 173 Yb (399 keV, 2.9 \u03BCs), and 175 Hf (126 keV, 54 \u03BCs) [29] . A log-likelihood fit to the time distribution of the 166-keV \u03B3 ray yields T 1 / 2 = 1.26 ( 17 ) \u03BCs, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (d). The reduced transition probability for the presumed E 2, 166-keV \u03B3 ray is evaluated to be B ( E 2 ; 1 / 2 \u2212 \u2192 5 / 2 \u2212 ) = 2.5 ( 3 ) e 2 fm 4 = 4.5 ( 6 ) \u00D7 10 \u2212 2 W.u. by taking into account the competing internal conversion process with a theoretical total conversion coefficient \u03B1 T cal = 0.44 [30] . The energies of the ( 1 / 2 \u2212 ) states and the B ( E 2 ) values in the N = 103 isotones are plotted in the upper and lower panels of Fig. 3 , respectively. It is to be noted that, although the aforementioned spin-parity assignments rely on the level systematics and plausible arguments on the observed transition strengths and decay patterns, all the individual arguments are convincing and ensure the full picture. The excitation energies of the , where the energy values are measured relative to the K \u03C0 = ( 3 + ) states in the N = 102 isotones vary smoothly around 1.2 MeV with a minimum at Z = 70 . To understand the underlying mechanism of the K \u03C0 = 3 + excitation from a microscopic viewpoint, we have performed model calculations based on a Skyrme energy-density-functional (EDF) in the same framework as that applied to the K \u03C0 = 2 + \u03B3 -vibrational excitation in our previous work [4,13] . With the use of the SkM* functional [35] , the ground states are calculated by the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method, while the Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) is employed for the intrinsic excitations. The experimental level energies in the N = 102 isotones are compared to the results of the HFB+QRPA calculation in the upper panel of Fig. 4 K \u03C0 = ( 3 + ) state in 168 Dy in order to highlight the variation in the excitation energy as a function of the proton number. It can be seen that the calculation satisfactorily reproduces the observed trend of the K \u03C0 = ( 3 + ) energies. As demonstrated in the lower panel of Fig. 4 , the \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] component dominates the K \u03C0 = 3 + wave functions in the N = 102 isotones considered here. The calculations indicate that the K \u03C0 = 3 + levels fall in energy towards Z = 70 along with the increase in the amplitude squared of the \u03C0 5 / 2 + [ 402 ] \u2297 \u03C0 1 / 2 + [ 411 ] and \u03C0 7 / 2 + [ 404 ] \u2297 \u03C0 1 / 2 + [ 411 ] components. Thus, these proton 2qp components play a decisive role in changing the excitation energy of the K \u03C0 = 3 + state along the isotonic chain. The QRPA calculation predicts that the sum of the amplitudes of these proton 2qp components is 14% for 172 Yb, consistent with the argument based on the experimental g K value [36] , while the K \u03C0 = 3 + state in 168 Dy consists of a nearly pure \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] configuration. The trend that the proton 2qp admixture is less significant in 168 Dy (and 170 Er) than in 172 Yb can be understood as follows: according to the Nilsson diagram for this mass region, the position of the Z = 70 Fermi level is located between the \u03C0 7 / 2 + [ 404 ] and \u03C0 1 / 2 + [ 411 ] orbitals, giving rise to the lowest-lying proton 2qp state. With decreasing proton number from 70 in the N = 102 isotonic chain, the energy of this proton 2qp state relative to the \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] neutron configuration should be increased, and whereby its contribution to the K \u03C0 = 3 + structure becomes smaller. It is noteworthy that low-lying K \u03C0 = 3 + bands are systematically identified in even-even nuclei with N = 98 \u2212 104 and Z = 68 \u2212 72 [29] , and that the J \u03C0 = 4 + members are strongly populated by deuteron and alpha inelastic scattering [37\u201339] that tends to favor collective excitations. The measured E 4 strengths suggest the presence of hexadecapole vibrational nature [37\u201339] . In order to understand the compares the original and modified SP energies around the K isomerism in the doubly midshell region, multi-quasiparticle calculations were performed for 168,170,172 Dy in a similar way to an approach in Ref. [40] , but with the inclusion of particle-number conservation by means of the Lipkin-Nogami prescription for the pairing correlations [41] . As the model implements the so-called \u201Cblocking effect\u201D, the calculated pairing gaps and the Fermi level become configuration dependent. The energies and ordering of deformed single-particle (SP) levels were initially calculated based on the Woods-Saxon potential with universal parameters for fixed deformations \u03B2 2 , \u03B2 4 , and \u03B2 6 taken from Ref. [3] , and then modified so as to reproduce approximately the empirical 1qp states in the neighboring odd- A nuclei. The left part of Fig. 5 Z = 66 and N = 102 Fermi surfaces. The most striking difference between the two sets of SP levels is the inversion of the \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] and \u03BD 7 / 2 + [ 633 ] orbits, which accounts for the appearance of the K \u03C0 = 3 + state at low excitation energy in the N = 102 isotones, as discussed above. The rising of the \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] level also causes a sizable gap at N = 98 between the \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 523 ] and \u03BD 7 / 2 + [ 633 ] orbitals [7] . The results of the multi-quasiparticle calculations obtained with the modified SP levels are shown in the right part of Fig. 5 . Here, the proton and neutron 2qp states were calculated independently, and subsequently corrected for the empirical residual interactions that depend on the configurations involved, i.e., the spin-singlet coupling is somewhat lowered in energy, while the energetically unfavored spin-triplet coupling is raised, following the Gallagher-Moszkowski rule [42] . The calculations suggest that there are two K \u03C0 = 4 \u2212 states with the \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] \u2297 \u03BD 7 / 2 + [ 633 ] and \u03C0 1 / 2 + [ 411 ] \u2297 \u03C0 7 / 2 \u2212 [ 523 ] configurations. For 168 Dy, these two configurations are expected to be strongly mixed since they are located in energy close to each other. (Such strong mixing between the two K \u03C0 = 4 \u2212 configurations was suggested to take place in the neighboring even- Z N = 102 isotone 170 Er based on the measured gyromagnetic ratios [24] .) Using the calculated energy difference (137 keV) and the mixing matrix element derived from the 170 Er case (190 keV [24] ), the wave function, 67% \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] \u2297 \u03BD 7 / 2 + [ 633 ] + 33% \u03C0 1 / 2 + [ 411 ] \u2297 \u03C0 7 / 2 \u2212 [ 523 ] , is evaluated for one of the two mixed K \u03C0 = 4 \u2212 states at lower energy (specified as 4 1 \u2212 ), which is associated with the 1378-keV isomeric state in 168 Dy. According to the calculations, there are two K \u03C0 = 6 \u2212 states with the \u03C0 7 / 2 \u2212 [ 523 ] \u2297 \u03C0 5 / 2 + [ 413 ] and \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 \u03BD 7 / 2 + [ 633 ] configurations above the 4 \u2212 states in 168 Dy. The neutron 2qp configuration was assigned to the K \u03C0 = 6 \u2212 isomers in the N = 102 isotones, 172 Yb [36] , 170 Er [24] , 166 Gd and 164 Sm [11] . Similarly to the aforementioned K = 4 \u2212 case, these two K \u03C0 = 6 \u2212 components should be mixed with each other due to the proximity of their energies. It is expected that the mixed 6 1 \u2212 state is higher in energy than the 4 1 \u2212 state, consistent with the energy systematics shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3 . The calculations also predict that the neutron 2qp excitations with K \u03C0 = 6 + ( \u03BD 7 / 2 \u2212 [ 514 ] \u2297 \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] ) and K \u03C0 = 8 \u2212 ( \u03BD 9 / 2 + [ 624 ] \u2297 \u03BD 7 / 2 \u2212 [ 514 ] ) emerge at relatively low excitation energies in 170 Dy and 172 Dy, respectively. They have been identified as a long-lived isomer in each Dy isotope [13,14] , while the corresponding levels were not observed in 168 Dy. In 169 Dy, the J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 1 / 2 \u2212 ) state is interpreted as being predominantly of neutron 1qp nature, and its low excitation energy (166 keV) is ascribed to the rising of the \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] level towards the \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] one. This state becomes a long-lived isomer because, in addition to the small energy gap, the 1 / 2 \u2212 \u2192 5 / 2 \u2212 \u201C K -allowed\u201D E 2 transition proceeds with changes in the asymptotic quantum numbers, [ \u0394 \u03A9 , \u0394 N , \u0394 n z , \u0394 \u039B ] = [ 2 , 0 , 1 , 1 ] [43] . Indeed, the corresponding E 2 transition in the N = 103 isotone 173 Yb has the smallest B ( E 2 ) value observed to date in any odd- A deformed nuclei [29] . As exhibited in the lower panel of Fig. 3 , however, the B ( E 2 ) values in 169 Dy and 171 Er are more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of 173 Yb. Note that the observed increase in B ( E 2 ) is in phase with a sudden fall of the \u03B3 -vibrational states in even- A Dy and Er isotopes compared to the Yb levels, indicating that \u03B3 -vibrational motion is enhanced [13] . As such, in order to explain the increase of B ( E 2 ) in 169 Dy, we consider states of mixed 1qp and \u03B3 -vibrational character. Based on the prescription described in Ref. [44] , the wave functions of the 1 / 2 \u2212 and 5 / 2 \u2212 states can be described as | 1 / 2 \u2212 \u232A = | \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] \u2297 0 gs + \u232A + \u03B1 1 / 2 | \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 2 \u03B3 + \u232A , | 5 / 2 \u2212 \u232A = | \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 0 gs + \u232A + \u03B1 5 / 2 | \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] \u2297 2 \u03B3 + \u232A , where the | \u03BD \u2297 0 gs + \u232A and | \u03BD \u2297 2 \u03B3 + \u232A terms represent the coupling of a neutron 1qp state with the ground state and the K \u03C0 = 2 + \u03B3 -vibrational excitation in the even-even core, respectively. The mixing coefficients \u03B1 1 / 2 , \u03B1 5 / 2 \u226A 1 are given by the perturbation theory as \u03B1 1 / 2 = \u2212 \u2329 \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 2 \u03B3 + | V | \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] \u2297 0 gs + \u232A E 2 \u03B3 + + E 1qp , \u03B1 5 / 2 = \u2212 \u2329 \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] \u2297 2 \u03B3 + | V | \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 0 gs + \u232A E 2 \u03B3 + \u2212 E 1qp , where E 2 \u03B3 + and E 1qp in the denominators represent the excitation energy of the 2 \u03B3 + state and the energy difference between the (unperturbed) \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 [ 521 ] and \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] levels, respectively. The numerators are the mixing matrix elements between the coupled states, which, for simplicity, are assumed to be equal to each other and denoted by \u2329 V \u232A in the following discussion. By omitting the cross term that contains the product of \u03B1 1 / 2 and \u03B1 5 / 2 in the E 2 matrix element, and using the single-particle and collective transition strengths, the reduced transition probability can be approximated as B ( E 2 ; 1 / 2 \u2212 \u2192 5 / 2 \u2212 ) \u2248 [ B ( E 2 ; \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 \u2192 \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 ) + ( \u03B1 1 / 2 + 1.73 \u03B1 5 / 2 ) B ( E 2 ; 2 \u03B3 + \u2192 0 gs + ) ] 2 . The values of B ( E 2 ; \u03BD 1 / 2 \u2212 \u2192 \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 ) = 1.88 \u00D7 10 \u2212 2 e 2 fm 4 and E 1qp = 399 keV are taken from the experimental data of 173 Yb [29] since, as suggested in Ref. [45] , the relative smallness of the E 2 matrix element between these states points to an almost total absence of \u03BD 5 / 2 \u2212 [ 512 ] \u2297 2 \u03B3 + in the 1 / 2 \u2212 band. As for the \u03B3 -vibrational core, the value of E 2 \u03B3 + is estimated to be 1150 keV with the assumption that the observed 1227-keV state in 168 Dy is the J \u03C0 = 3 + member of the \u03B3 -vibrational band, while B ( E 2 ; 2 \u03B3 + \u2192 0 gs + ) = 2.06 \u00D7 10 2 e 2 fm 4 is adopted from 170 Er [29] that shows a similar enhancement of \u03B3 vibration. In consequence, the parameters \u2329 V \u232A = \u2212 34 keV, \u03B1 1 / 2 = 0.022 , \u03B1 5 / 2 = 0.045 are obtained. It can be seen that a tiny (<1%) admixture of \u03B3 vibration with the dominating neutron 1qp component enables the large increase in the E 2 strengths for the 1 / 2 \u2212 \u2192 5 / 2 \u2212 transition. The weak mixing phenomenon observed in the present work is at variance with the majority of data concerning the occurrence of \u03B3 -vibrational mixing in well-deformed odd- A nuclides: the observed low-lying K = 1 / 2 states of mixed 1qp-plus- \u03B3 -vibrational character are in most cases found to contain appreciable admixtures of collective components [45] . For instance, approximately equal components of the admixed 1qp and \u03BD \u2297 2 \u03B3 + configurations were suggested for the K \u03C0 = 1 / 2 \u2212 state at 707 keV in 171 Er and the K \u03C0 = 1 / 2 + states at 581 keV in 159 Tb and at 879 keV in 183 Re. Such strong \u03B3 -vibrational mixing is known to occur with \u2329 V \u232A of the order of a few hundreds of keV, when the admixed 1qp excitation is connected to the \u201Cbase\u201D state, to which 2 \u03B3 + is coupled, by large (non-axial) quadrupole matrix elements, i.e., their asymptotic quantum numbers differ by \u0394 \u03A9 = \u0394 \u039B = \u00B1 2 with N and n z unchanged. To conclude, the excited states of 168 Dy and 169 Dy, which have two- and one-neutron vacancies relative to the doubly midshell nucleus 170 Dy, have been populated following the decay from previously unreported isomeric states with half-lives of 0.57(7) \u03BCs and 1.26(17) \u03BCs, respectively. In 168 Dy, the J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 4 \u2212 ) isomeric state at 1378 keV is expected to have a mixed proton and neutron 2qp configuration, while the HFB+QRPA calculation suggests that the J \u03C0 = K \u03C0 = ( 3 + ) level, which is located 40 keV below the isomer, is of nearly pure neutron 2qp nature. For 169 Dy, the observed large enhancement of the B ( E 2 ) value for the ( 1 / 2 \u2212 ) \u2192 ( 5 / 2 \u2212 ) isomeric-decay transition over the corresponding transition in the heavier N = 103 isotone 173 Yb can be explained by configuration mixing between a dominating neutron 1qp component and \u03B3 -vibrational excitations in the K \u03C0 = ( 1 / 2 \u2212 ) isomeric state.

Synthesized sodium acrylate (NaAc) and 2-Bromoacrylic acid (BrAc) copolymer hydrogels for metal ion capture were characterized using FTIR, UV–Vis, 13C NMR, and DSC methods for structural and functional properties. Both FTIR and UV–Vis spectra indicated formation of a charge transfer complex between Br, CH<inf>3</inf> groups and the carbonyl (C═O) group whereas solid-state NMR evidenced Br group appearance as an appendage on hydrogel backbone. By incorporating Br group on the hydrogel matrix and consequently exploiting the high electronegativity potential and inductive effect chemistry of this group, there was a significant increase in dissociation of H+ ions and hence higher loading capacity of carboxylate group. This facilitated higher ion exchange ability, resulting in up to 4 times increase in adsorption capacity during adsorption from multi-element metal ion competitive solution. Separately, when applied on single ion non-competitive solution, its adsorption capacity on vanadium increased three-fold from 119 mg/g to 373 mg/g due to the effect of Br group. However, the CH<inf>3</inf> had a negating effect instead lowering the adsorption capacity (below 119 mg/g); while also caused lower swelling ratio of carboxylate-functionalized hydrogel adsorbents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2-Bromoacrylic acid; Hydrogel adsorbent; Loading capacity; Network; Thermal stability; Vanadium adsorption","Adsorption; Binary alloys; Carboxylation; Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Electronegativity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogels; Ion exchange; Metal ions; Metals; Networks (circuits); Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Thermodynamic stability; Adsorption capacities; Carboxylate groups; Charge transfer complex; Copolymer hydrogels; Functional properties; Hydrogel polymers; Inductive effects; Loading capacities; Bromine","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 21656239, 24360398.

The present study aims to investigate the characteristics of stable H/O isotopes of groundwater and surface water in a coastal area of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Isotopes and chloride concentrations of surface water show a highly seasonal and linearly spatial variability, depending on the distance to the sea. The seasonal variation of upstream discharge and rainfall plays an important role in changes of the isotopic compositions and chloride concentrations. Tide also influences on chloride concentrations of surface water while it does not change the isotopic compositions. Evaporation plays a crucial role in changes of isotopic compositions, while the influence of freshwater/seawater mixing on isotopic variabilities is negligible. Groundwater has a spatial heterogeneity in isotopic compositions and chloride concentrations, reflecting different recharge sources and seawater intrusion processes. Groundwater in shallow aquifers originates from rainfall and surface water with small evaporative losses, and it experienced different magnitudes of mixing with seawater. Groundwater in deep aquifers might be recharged by open-surface water evaporation in the last glacial age with minor impacts of seawater intrusion on these aquifers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coastal aquifers; deuterium excess; evaporation process; hydrogen-2; Mekong Delta; oxygen-18; seawater intrusion; Vietnam","Aquifers; Chlorine compounds; Coastal zones; Evaporation; Groundwater resources; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogen; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Mixing; Oxygen; Rain; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Chloride concentrations; Coastal aquifers; Deuterium excess; Evaporation process; Hydrogen-2; Isotopic composition; Mekong Delta; Oxygen-18 [; Stable isotopes; Viet Nam; Surface waters; deuterium; evaporation; hydrogen; isotopic composition; stable isotope; water chemistry; water quality; water resource; fresh water; ground water; oxygen; sea water; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; water supply; Deuterium; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Groundwater; Oxygen Isotopes; Vietnam; Water Resources","","deuterium, 7782-39-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Deuterium; Oxygen Isotopes","We would like to thank the University of Tsukuba and MEXT Scholarship, Japan for facilitating the research.

Host plant resistance has tremendous potential to reduce the damage caused to rice by the planthopper. However, the effectiveness of resistance genes varies spatially and temporally according to BPH virulence. Understanding patterns in BPH virulence against resistance genes is necessary to efficiently and sustainably deploy resistant rice varieties. To survey BPH virulence patterns, seven near-isogenic lines (NILs), each with a single BPH resistance gene (BPH2-NIL, BPH3-NIL, BPH17-NIL, BPH20-NIL, BPH21-NIL, BPH32-NIL and BPH17-ptb-NIL) and fifteen pyramided lines (PYLs) carrying multiple resistance genes were developed with the genetic background of the japonica rice variety, Taichung 65 (T65), and assessed for resistance levels against two BPH populations (Hadano-66 and Koshi-2013 collected in Japan in 1966 and 2013, respectively). Many of the NILs and PYLs were resistant against the Hadano-66 population but were less effective against the Koshi-2013 population. Among PYLs, BPH20+BPH32-PYL and BPH2+BPH3+BPH17-PYL granted relatively high BPH resistance against Koshi-2013. The NILs and PYLs developed in this research will be useful to monitor BPH virulence prior to deploying resistant rice varieties and improve rice’s resistance to BPH in the context of regionally increasing levels of virulence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brown planthopper; Near-isogenic lines; Pyramided lines; Resistance; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Virulence","","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, grant numbers JP15H04438 and 17K07606.

The sampling and questionnaire surveys were conducted for measuring characterisation and management practice of solid waste. A material flow analysis method was used for analysing the waste flow. The results show that the tourism destination generated daily around 15080 kg t of waste, in which the significant proportions come from restaurants (46%), hotels (22%) and households (13%). The feature of the waste composition is high rates of kitchen waste (46.8%), tissue (11.54%) and recyclable materials (12.58%), which result in high moisture (46.79%) and a low heating value (16,866 kJ kg-1) of waste. Also, solid waste management practices were evasively implemented by stakeholders with low rates and efficiency. Furthermore, a substantial gap of the solid waste management system is the confusion in waste collection activities, which is shown by the overload of waste in street bins and the financial loss for the solid waste management system owing to the non-compliance with collection regulation of stakeholders. Also, the mixing of waste by collection crews after separation at sources, the in-appropriation of collection time and manner are the dark points of the solid waste management system that may be causes of the non-cooperation of stakeholders. These gaps and confusion in the solid waste management system are the significant challenges in the improvement of the solid waste management system in the tourism destination toward sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","challenges of solid waste; Hoi An City; solid waste in Vietnam; Solid waste management; tourism destination; waste characterisation; waste collection; waste flow analysis","Bins; Heating; Losses; Solid wastes; Surveys; Hoi An City; tourism destination; Viet Nam; Waste characterisation; Waste collection; Waste flows; Waste management; management practice; material flow analysis; solid waste; stakeholder; tourist destination; waste disposal; waste management; article; flow measurement; food waste; heating; household; human; human experiment; moisture; questionnaire; restaurant; sampling; solid waste management; tourism; city; family size; Hoi An; Cities; Family Characteristics; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Vietnam; Waste Management","","Solid Waste","The authors are thankful to The University of Danang – University of Technology and Education, and Okayama University for financial assistance and their support.

In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs incorporate the variant time scale into their computational model. Since each neuron in these networks is connected to thousands of others, high bandwidth is required. Moreover, since the spike times are used to encode information in SNN, very low communication latency is also needed. The 2D-NoC was used as a solution to provide a scalable interconnection fabric in large-scale parallel SNN systems. The 3D-ICs have also attracted a lot of attention as a potential solution to resolve the interconnect bottleneck. The combination of these two emerging technologies provides a new horizon for IC designs to satisfy the high requirements of low power and small footprint in emerging AI applications. In this work, we first present a comprehensive analytical model to analyze the performance of 3D mesh NoC over variants of different SNN topologies and communications protocols. Second, we present an architecture and a low-latency spike routing algorithm, named shortest path K-means based multicast (SP-KMCR), for three-dimensional NoC of spiking neurons (3DNoC-SNN).

The architecture of the proposed TF is developed based on the adaptive method of the coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm. The 65-nm SOTB technology was chosen because of its ultra-low-power advantage. Furthermore, the back-gate bias technique can be applied on an SOTB chip to adjust the operation for high-performance or low-power requirement. The layout of the SOTB 65-nm TF core is about 22869 gate-count on the die area of 86721 μm2. The measurement results show that the core reached its highest operating frequency of 55 MHz at the 1.2-V supply voltage (V<inf>DD</inf>) with the forward back-gate bias (FBB) ≥ 1.5 V.

The concept of a water candle device is introduced, and the device is manufactured. By continuously generating a thin water film in combination with a conductivity sensor, the device is capable of measuring aerosol chloride deposition in all directions and has a compact design. The water candle device was fully tested in the laboratory and applied to monitor on a bridge. For the laboratory tests, the transport of aerosol in an area near the seashore was simulated to evaluate the accuracy and responsiveness of the device according to the variable wind speed and source salt concentration. For monitoring in the field, the device was implemented at the Thuan Phuoc Bridge, Vietnam, for seven days with a short recording frequency of a few hours. A set of wet candle devices were placed next to the water candle device to compare the results of the two methods. The results of the laboratory test and field monitoring demonstrated a high accuracy and responsiveness of the water candle device to variations in the wind speed and salt concentration of the source.

However, heat indices developed to allow for this have not consistently predicted mortality better than dry-bulb temperature. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to clarify the potential contribution of humidity an addition to temperature in predicting daily mortality in summer by using a large multicountry dataset. METHODS: In 445 cities in 24 countries, we fit a time-series regression model for summer mortality with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) for temperature (up to lag 3) and supplemented this with a range of terms for relative humidity (RH) and its interaction with temperature. Cityspecific associations were summarized using meta-analytic techniques. RESULTS: Adding a linear term for RH to the temperature term improved fit slightly, with an increase of 23% in RH (the 99th percentile anomaly) associated with a 1.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8, 1.3] decrease in mortality. Allowing curvature in the RH term or adding terms for interaction of RH with temperature did not improve the model fit. The humidity-related decreased risk was made up of a positive coefficient at lag 0 outweighed by negative coefficients at lags of 1–3 d. Key results were broadly robust to small model changes and replacing RH with absolute measures of humidity. Replacing temperature with apparent temperature, a metric combining humidity and temperature, reduced goodness of fit slightly. DISCUSSION: The absence of a positive association of humidity with mortality in summer in this large multinational study is counter to expectations from physiologic studies, though consistent with previous epidemiologic studies finding little evidence for improved prediction by heat indices. The result that there was a small negative average association of humidity with mortality should be interpreted cautiously; the lag structure has unclear interpretation and suggests the need for future work to clarify. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5430. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","article; city; expectation; heat; high temperature; human; humidity; mortality; multicenter study; prediction; sensitivity analysis; summer; time series analysis; environmental exposure; nonlinear system; season; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Hot Temperature; Humans; Humidity; Mortality; Nonlinear Dynamics; Seasons","","","Funding text 1: 1Department of Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK 2Center for Statistical Methodology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK 3Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Instituto de Investigaciones Gino Germani, Buenos Aires, Argentina 4Section of Sustainable Health, Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Ume\u00E5 University, Ume\u00E5, Sweden 5School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA 6National Institute of Environmental Health Science, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan 7Institute of Advanced Studies, University of S\u00E3o Paulo, S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil 8Department of Public Health, Universidad de los Andes, Santiago, Chile 9Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, Da Nang, Vietnam 10Department of Environmental Health, Faculty of Public Health, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 11Department of Environmental Health, National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico 12Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Ume\u00E5 University, Sweden 13Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin), Dublin, Ireland 14Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan 15Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, NTU Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan 16Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia 17Climate, Air Quality Research Unit, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia 18Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan 19Faculty of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan 20Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia 21Department of Statistics and Computational Research, University of Val\u00E8ncia, Val\u00E8ncia, Spain 22Biomedical Research Center Network of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain 23Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China 24Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea 25Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic 26Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic 27School of Epidemiology and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada 28Air Health Science Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Canada 29Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Service, Rome, Italy 30Sant\u00E9 Publique France, Department of Environmental Health, French National Public Health Agency, Saint Maurice, France 31Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland 32University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland 33Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a kind of ANN, which mimic real biological neural networks, conveying information through the communication of short pulses between neurons. Since each neuron in these networks is connected to thousands of others, high bandwidth is required. Moreover, since the spike times are used to encode information in SNN, very low communication latency is also required. The 2D-NoC was used as a solution to provide a scalable interconnection fabric in large-scale parallel SNN systems. The 3D-ICs have also attracted a lot of attention as a potential solution to resolve the interconnect bottleneck. The combination of these two emerging technologies provides a new horizon for IC designs to satisfy the high requirements of low-power and small footprint in emerging AI applications. This paper first presents an analytical model to analyze the performance of different neural network topologies and compare it with a system-level simulation. Second, we present an architecture and a low-latency routing algorithm for spike traffic routing in 3D-NoC of spiking neurons (3DNoC-SNN). The 3DNoC-SNN is validated based on an RTL-level implementation, while area/power analysis is performed using 45-nm CMOS technology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3DNoC-SNN; Analytical assessment; Low-latency multicast algorithm; Spiking neural network","Integrated circuit interconnects; Network-on-chip; Neurons; Routing algorithms; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Topology; 3DNoC-SNN; Analytical assessment; Biological neural networks; Information processing functions; Multicast algorithms; Neural network topology; Spiking neural networks; System level simulation; Neural networks","","","This work is supported by the Competitive Research Funding (CRF), the University of Aizu, Ref.

Many geosynthetic materials have been developed to stabilise soil slopes while also being environmentally friendly and convenient for construction. In this study, the performance of a novel geosynthetic cementitious composite mat (GCCM) is studied regarding its ability to stabilise soil slopes. Physical model tests are performed on sandy soil slopes under seepage conditions both with and without GCCM stabilisation. Particle image velocimetry is used to measure the soil displacement, and standpipe piezometers are used to monitor the pore water pressure of the slope. The results show that the slope displacement with GCCM stabilisation is much smaller than that without it. The presence of the GCCM constrains the displacement near the slope surface to being along the slope, whereas without the GCCM the slope can deform freely especially in the middle to upper zone of slope area. The results indicate that the GCCM performs well at slope stabilisation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1G physical model; Composite materials; Deformation; Geosynthetics; Particle image velocimetry; Slope stabilisation","Composite materials; Deformation; Flow visualization; Geosynthetic materials; Seepage; Soils; Stabilization; Velocimeters; Velocity measurement; Water towers; Cementitious composites; Geosynthetics; Particle image velocimetries; Physical model; Physical model test; Pore-water pressures; Research interests; Slope displacements; Slope protection; composite; deformation; displacement; geosynthetics; particle image velocimetry; sandy soil; slope stability; slope stabilization","","","This research was supported by the Thailand Research Fund (grant no.

In the past decades, the failure in such layered media has been studied by many researchers due to their critical role in the mechanics and physics of solids. This study aims at investigating crack-interface interaction in two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) layered media by a phase field model. Our objectives are fourfold: (a) to better understand fracture behavior in layered heterogeneous systems under quasi-static load; (b) to introduce a new methodology for better describing interfaces by a regularized interfacial transition zone in the context of variational phase field approach, exploring its important role; (c) to show the accuracy, performance and applicability of the present model in modeling material failure at the interfaces in both 2-D and 3-D bodies; and (d) to quantitatively validate computed crack path with respect to experimental data. Phase field models with both perfectly and cohesive bonded interfaces are thus derived. A regularized interfacial transition zone is introduced to capture characteristics of material mismatch at the interfaces. Numerical examples for 2-D and 3-D layered systems with experimental validation provide fundamentals of fracture behavior in layered structures. The obtained results shed light on the behavior of crack paths, which are drastically affected by the elastic modulus mismatch between two layers and interface types, and reveal the important role of the proposed interfacial transition zone in phase field modeling of crack-interface interactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cohesive zone model; Crack propagation; Finite element analysis; Fracture; Layered structure; Phase field model","Crack propagation; Fracture; Interfaces (materials); Cohesive zone model; Crack interfaces; Cracks propagation; Finite element analyse; In-phase; Interfacial transition zone; Layered media; Layered Structures; Mechanical behavior; Phase field models; Finite element method","","","The support this work enjoys from SeRaMCo project (Secondary Raw Materials for Concrete Precast Products), through the transnational cooperation projects in North-West Europe ( Interreg NWE), NWE-320 is gratefully acknowledged.

Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) water management is effective and saves water. However, practical examples of AWD at the district or on-farm level are limited. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of AWD in experimental block units (conventional, weak-dry, and strong-dry) in paddy fields of about 44 ha in the Red River Delta area of Vietnam by examining the effects of intermittent irrigation (i.e., AWD) on the ponding depth, CH <inf>4</inf> and N <inf>2</inf> O emissions, and rice yield in blocked experimental plots. Intermittent irrigation was expected to be achieved through the operation of irrigation pumps and sluice gates of water division works by the water management organization (water user group) of the district. However, the ponding depth was not controlled as initially planned because of frequent rainfall and low rate of decrease of the ponding depth in the study area. It was, however, confirmed that the period during which the ponding depth decreased below the soil surface was mostly (but not always) longer in the dry-type blocks. CH <inf>4</inf> emissions decreased with an increase in drying period and this reduction was large in the summer-autumn season. There appeared to be no relationship between N <inf>2</inf> O emissions and water management. Rice yield decreased due to extreme drying in the summer-autumn season but was not affected by drying in the winter-spring season. This study demonstrated that CH <inf>4</inf> emissions can be reduced and rice yield can be maintained by achieving a maximum drying index (i.e., ratio of the period during which the ponding depth is below the soil surface) of 0.6 in the summer-autumn season in the paddy fields of the target area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternate wetting and drying; Greenhouse gas; On-farm water management; Water management organization","Drying; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Nitrogen oxides; Ponding; Wetting; Experimental plots; Intermittent irrigations; Nitrous oxide emissions; Rice cultivation; Water management systems; Water shortages; Water user groups; WETTING AND DRYING; Water management; agricultural emission; crop yield; cultivation; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; seasonal variation; soil surface; water management; wetting-drying cycle; Red River Delta; Viet Nam","","","This work was conducted by the joint project between Institute for Water Environment under Vietnam Academy for Water Resources in Vietnam and Industrial-Academic Cooperative Research for Irrigation Water Management in Japan consisting of Kitai Sekkei Co., Ltd. and Kyoto University, and financially supported by Ministry of Science and Technology in Vietnam (Grant Number: NĐT.06.JPN/15 ), JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Numbers: 16H05799 and 18H02297 ), and “Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program)” from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan .

In the new simulation, the compliance matrix that links the stress and elastic strain increments in the principal stress axes was formulated symmetrically, as required by the law of thermodynamics. Comparisons between the simulation results and experimental data showed that the modified model could effectively simulate the experimental data values. Note that differences between the simulated values of compliance matrix [M] in the material axes obtained by both models were generally small within the employed stress paths, except the M<inf>26</inf> and M<inf>62</inf> values. The effect of inherent anisotropy on quasi-elastic components of the compliance matrix in the material axes was generally small at low shear stress ratio values (τ<inf>z</inf>θ/σ'<inf>θ</inf>) during torsional loading from the isotropic stress state, and increased at larger shear stress ratio values, especially during torsional loading from the anisotropic stress state. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anisotropy; elasticity; Poisson’s ratio; sand; shear modulus; Young's modulus","Anisotropy; Elasticity; Loading; Matrix algebra; Sand; Shear flow; Shear strain; Shear stress; Stress analysis; Thermodynamics; Compliance matrixes; Elastic components; Elastic properties; Poisson’s ratio; S ratio; Shear stress ratio; Stress state; Stress-induced anisotropy; Torsional loadings; Young modulus; Elastic moduli","","","The first author acknowledges the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) for providing financial support, under grant number 107.99-2012.31.

In this study, six toxic elements (As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Cu) in soils and sediments of the Ba Lat estuary, northern Vietnam, were assessed using the ICP-MS technique. Soil properties, such as major minerals, soil particles, organic carbon content, were also measured using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) system and other common methods. The FE-EPMA technique was applied to explore the surface chemical properties of the soil and sediment particles. Detailed information about arsenic and heavy metal forms in the samples was analyzed by the sequential extraction method. Sixty-seven surface soil and sediment samples were collected. In addition, several soil and sediment cores (1 m of depth) were also taken from mangrove forests and paddy fields to evaluate their toxic element content. The chemical analyses have shown that the surface layers of the river sediment and mangrove forest soil contain accumulated As and heavy metals, which could have been transported from the upstream Red River. The average concentrations of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Cu) did not exceed the allowable limit for agricultural soil; however, these elements tend to accumulate on the surface layer of the soil and sediment profiles. The spatial distribution of the toxic elements suggests that intensive human activities in the upstream Red River in recent decades were the cause of elevated levels of these toxic elements in the estuarine ecosystem of Ba Lat estuary. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural soil; Arsenic; Estuarine ecosystem; FE-EPMA; Heavy metals; ICP-MS","Arsenic; Chemical analysis; Ecosystems; Estuaries; Extraction; Forestry; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Organic carbon; Rivers; Sediments; Soils; Sustainable development; Trace elements; Agricultural soils; Element contents; FE-EPMA; ICP-MS; Mangrove forest; Soil and sediment; Soil particles; Surface layers; Toxic elements; Viet Nam; Heavy metals","","","The content of this paper is part of the PhD thesis of Nguyen Van Thinh, who received a scholarship from MEXT during his doctoral course at Kyushu University.

It has been reported that both types of cells are decreased in myeloproliferative neoplasms in patients and also in a mouse model, whereas an increase in NESCs was reported in acute myeloid leukemia. It is thus of interest whether and how these BM stromal cells are structured in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Here, we focused on NESCs and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells in the BM of MDS patients. We found a marked increase of NESCs in MDS with fibrosis (MDS-F) at a high frequency (9/19; 47.4%), but not in MDS without fibrosis (0/26; 0%). Intriguingly, in eight of the nine (88.9%) MDS-F cases with elevated NESCs, a majority of NESCs also expressed GFAP, with an additional increase in GFAP single-positive cells. Furthermore, in seven of them, we found a prominent structure characterized by neurofilament heavy chain staining surrounded by NESCs with GFAP expression. This structure may represent peripheral nerve axons surrounded by Schwann cells, and could be relevant to the pathophysiology of MDS-F. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fibrosis; Human bone marrow; Myelodysplastic syndromes; Nestin-expressing stromal cells; Schwann cells","cell marker; DNA methyltransferase 3A; glial fibrillary acidic protein; nestin; GFAP protein, human; NES protein, human; Article; bone marrow; bone marrow biopsy; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; fibrosis; frequency; heavy chain; human; myelodysplastic syndrome; neural crest cell; neurofilament; pathophysiology; peripheral nerve; protein expression; Schwann cell; silver staining; staining; vascularization; adult; animal; biosynthesis; bone marrow cell; female; male; metabolism; middle aged; mouse; myeloid metaplasia; pathology; Adult; Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Female; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Humans; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Nestin; Primary Myelofibrosis; Schwann Cells","","nestin, 146315-66-4; GFAP protein, human; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; NES protein, human; Nestin","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Tran B.

Batch adsorption experiments were conducted in functional conditions including contact time, ratios of (CMC:CMCts) and SSS, pH value, temperature and adsorbent weight. Equilibrium contact time of 10 h. was obtained by the adsorption material. The optimal 4:2 ratio of (CMC:CMCts):SSS showed the Ag highest adsorption efficiency. The maximum percentage of Ag+ removal was achieved at the pH 5. The temperature effect on the adsorption ability of hybrid hydrogel indicated the Ag adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. The Langmuir isotherm model fitted Ag adsorption data well, assuming a monolayer adsorption with predicted maximum adsorption capacity of 451.74 × 10−3 mg. g–1.

Mangrove ecosystems in Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve contribute significantly to the role of coastal protection, climate change resilience, and local economic development. Historical satellite remote sensing data, intensive field surveys and GIS techniques have been employed in many tropical areas worldwide to detect mangrove changes. The objective of this study is to use Landsat imagery covering the past 44 years (1973–2016) to study historical changes of the mangrove ecosystems in the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve and to document the current distribution of species diversity in the Reserve's mangrove ecosystems. The field surveys and analysis of satellite remote sensing data revealed that the mangrove ecosystem in Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve has fluctuated significantly in both temporal and spatial distribution. This study has newly documented eight mangrove species to the inventory of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve mangroves species composition. This study is regarded as the first study using multi-spectral satellite remote sensing image to assess the distribution status and historical changes of mangrove ecosystems in central Vietnam. The outcomes can contribute to assessing the dynamic trends of coastal ecosystem changes during the past 44 years to provide sustainable development strategies for the area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Landsat; Mangrove ecosystem degradation; Satellite remote sensing; Temporal and spatial variability","","","","The authors would like to thank the Coastal & Marine Environment Research Group (CENRE) research team members for their support with experiments at the Environmental Science Laboratory, Faculty of Environmental Science, HU-University of Sciences and their excellent assistance in the field while collecting samples.

Prior to this long-term monitoring, weekly sampling monitoring was tested by short-term test in Yokohama city. This short-term test showed that the total chloride amount collected by weekly sampling frequency is almost equal to that collected by monthly sampling frequency in a same monitoring period, i.e. it is applicable to conduct aerosol chloride deposition monitoring with weekly sampling frequency. Besides, a new effect analysis of wind on chloride deposition using effective wind power was proposed and applied for long-term monitored data and meteorological data in this study.

This study revealed that the solid waste management (SWM) system of the hotel industry in HAC has a high potential for developing recycling practices. The high percentage of recyclable materials (84.3%), the achievements of waste separation practices, and the intentions of SWM of the hoteliers are favourable conditions for enhancing recycling practices. Furthermore, this study indicated that recycling could reduce 30–70% of total hotel waste, lead to beneficial changes in waste characterisation for incineration and composting processes, and bring economic profits to the hotels. In addition, recycling strategies with the synchronous combination of improvement of waste separation at source, waste regulation promulgation, and enhancement of waste management motivation for the hotels were discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hoi An City; Recycling potential; Vietnam; Waste management; Waste separation","Hotels; Recycling; Separation; Source separation; Storm sewers; Waste incineration; Hierarchical structures; Hoi An City; Recyclable material; Recycling potential; Viet Nam; Waste characterisation; Waste management practices; Waste separation; Waste management","","","The authors are grateful to the People’s Committee of Hoi An City for their support.

Here, we describe a clinical strain of Escherichia coli from Vietnam carrying both mcr-1 and bla<inf>NDM-1</inf>. Whole-genome sequencing showed that the genome of this strain consists of a 4,975,832-bp chromosome and four plasmids. The mcr-1 and bla<inf>NDM-1</inf> genes are located on IncI2 and IncA/C2-type plasmids, respectively. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of a multidrug-resistant region with the structure of a novel complex class 1 integron including a class 1 integron region bearing two 5′ conserved segments and one 3′ conserved segment and two complete structures of ISCR1. The complex integron contains aminoglycoside resistance genes aadA2, aadB, strA, strB, and aphA6, quinolone resistance gene qnrA1, extended-spectrum β-lactamase gene bla<inf>OXA-4</inf>, and a Tn125-like transposon bearing bla<inf>NDM-1</inf>. In addition, the dfrA12-gcuF-aadA2-cmlA1-aadA1-qacH gene cassette array belonging to the sul3-type integron was also identified, but the region found downstream of the gene cassette array is the IS440-tet(M)-IS26 element instead of the sul3 gene. The results further support that Enterobacteriaceae isolates co-harboring mcr and bla<inf>NDM</inf> are widely being distributed. The structural characteristics of the complex integron reveal that ISCR1 elements play an important role in the mobilization of bla<inf>NDM-1</inf> and the development of multidrug-resistant regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BlaNDM-1; Carbapenemase; Colistin; Complex class 1 integron; Escherichia coli; Mcr-1; Sul3-type integron","genomic DNA; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bioinformatics; blood sampling; cell assay; controlled study; DNA extraction; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli; gene mutation; gene sequence; human; integron; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; sequence analysis; Viet Nam; whole genome sequencing","GENBANK: CP031293, CP031297, KX023259, KX518744","","This study was supported by the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS).

The greatest energy potential was found in the offshore area of Phu Quy island (Binh Thuan province). The area, alone, can provide the 38.2 GW power generation capacity corresponding to the increasing renewable-energy demand by 2030 planned by the country. There is also a drawback of the wind resource, which is associated with strong multiplescale temporal variabilities. The seasonal variability associated with monsoon onsets and daily variability associated with the wind diurnal cycles were found ranging 30-50%. Meanwhile, the inter-annual variability could reach up to 10%. These variabilities must be considered when designing wind farms and grids over the region. Additionally, due to the fact that the WRF model performed climatological features of the winds well against the observations, this results indicate that it can be useful tools for windpower assessment as compared to other reanalysis or QuikSCAT data with coarser spatio-temporal resolutions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was supported by the “Interdisciplinary Computational Science Program” in the Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba.

The complete genome of strain PIMB10EC27 was sequenced by PacBio RSII and the Illumina Miseq system. Whole-genome analysis revealed that PIMB10EC27 contains a chromosome of the ST513 group (PIMBEC27, length 5,272,177 bp) and two plasmids, pEC27-1 of the IncX3 group (length 62,470 bp) and pEC27-2 of the IncHI1 group (length 84,602 bp). It also revealed that strain PIMB10EC27 carries 15 genes that confer resistance to at least 10 antibiotic groups. Particularly, the insertion of ISKpn19 and Tn6901 into the genomic context of blaNDM-1 was first identified and described. In another context, amino acid mutations G273D in PmrB and F515S in PmrC were first identified on the chromosome of PIMB10EC27, which may confer resistance to colistin in this strain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BlaNDM-1; Colistin; Enterobacter cloacae; Multidrug-resistance; Tn6901","beta lactamase; carbapenem; colistin; New Delhi metallo beta lactamase 1; unclassified drug; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; blaNDM 1 gene; carbapenem resistant Enterobacter cloacae; case report; clinical article; colistin resistant Enterobacter cloacae; drug effect; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; gene; gene insertion; gene sequence; genome; genome analysis; genomics; human; infection control; ISKpn19 gene; male; mutation; plasmid; Tn6901 gene; Viet Nam","","beta lactamase, 9073-60-3; carbapenem, 83200-96-8; colistin, 1066-17-7, 1264-72-8","Funding text 1: Dr Tam-Duong Le-Ha reports grants from the US Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), grants from the National Institute of Health (NIH), and grants from the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, during the conduct of the study.

Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from SFs and MFs, and the oocytes were denuded at 0, 20, and 44 h after the start of in vitro maturation (IVM), and the meiotic progression of the oocytes was assessed at the end of the IVM period. The incidence of mature oocytes was significantly affected by both the origin of the COCs and the time when the oocytes were denuded. Although the percentage of mature oocytes was always higher when the COCs were collected from MFs than that when the COCs were collected from SFs, the maturation rate was significantly higher when the oocytes were denuded at 20 h than when they were denuded at 44 h after the start of IVM. When the mature oocytes were activated electrically, the developmental competence of the oocytes denuded at 20 and 44 h to reach the blastocyst stage did not differ, whereas the competence of the MF-derived oocytes was significantly higher than that of SF-derived oocytes. When the intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels in SF-derived oocytes were examined at 24 h of IVM, the levels of both were significantly decreased only in the oocytes denuded at 20 h. In conclusion, denuding oocytes at 20 h of IVM caused a significant reduction in ooplasmic cAMP and cGMP levels and increased the meiotic competence of the oocytes without any reduction in blastocyst formation, even in the case of SF-derived oocytes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CAMP; CGMP; Cumulus cells; In vitro maturation; Pig","cyclic AMP; cyclic GMP; animal; cell culture; cell separation; cumulus cell; cytology; down regulation; drug effect; embryo development; evaluation study; female; in vitro oocyte maturation; meiosis; metabolism; oocyte; physiology; pig; procedures; time factor; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cell Separation; Cells, Cultured; Cumulus Cells; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic GMP; Down-Regulation; Embryonic Development; Female; In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques; Meiosis; Oocytes; Swine; Time Factors","","cyclic AMP, 60-92-4; cyclic GMP, 7665-99-8; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic GMP","The authors would like to thank the local slaughterhouse, Okayama Prefectural Local Meat Wholesale Market for the donation of the porcine ovaries used in this study.

The arc shape variation, arc pressure evolution and the molten pool behavior were observed and measured to discover the relationship to the weld joint formation. It was found that the small plasma arc pressure in the center with a similar affected region and enough upward shear force of arc plasma are the necessary conditions to get a stable keyhole process, which could drive the liquid metal of the back side weld pool converges at the bottom of the keyhole and flows upward and form a high-quality weld bead. Comparing the welding stability and quality, adjusting polarity time is the good method for completing the necessary conditions. With the variable polarity time decreasing, the stable keyholes process and acceptable weld quality were obtained in the flat position. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aluminum alloy; Flat keyhole welding; Keyhole stability; Plasma arc pressure; VPPA welding","Aluminum alloys; Electric welding; Laser beam welding; Plasma stability; Plasma torches; Shear flow; Welds; High quality welds; Influence mechanism; Keyhole welding; Plasma arc; Variable polarity; Variable polarity plasma arc; Welding process; Welding stability; Plasma welding","","","Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51875004 ); National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2014zx04001-171 ); State Key Lab of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology ( AWJ-16-M06 ); And supported by the China Scholarship Council for 1 year study at Osaka University.","Welding Handbook, (1991); Zhang, Y.

It is systematically found that the encapsulation of methanol enhances the mechanical stability of MOF-901 as the elastic tensors C<inf>ij</inf> of MOF-901∙nMeOH are higher than the corresponding C<inf>ij</inf> quantities reported for solvent-free MOF-901. Moreover, the 2D characteristics of MOF-901 is confirmed by verifying the negative values of C<inf>33</inf>. At the same time, the band gap of MOF-901 is observed to be solvent-dependent. In its pure form, MOF-901 possesses a direct gap (E<inf>g</inf>) of 2.07 eV, with the valence and conduction bands mainly constituted by electrons of 4-aminobenzoate linkers. Introducing methanol into MOF-901 causes distortion to the 4-aminobenzoate geometry, thereby induces electronic degeneracy to the conduction bands. Consequently, E<inf>g</inf> is narrowed to 1.84 eV with 5.7 wt% MeOH or 1.63 eV with 11.4 wt% MeOH. Hence, it is possible to tailor the band gap of MOF-901 by controlling methanol guest, which only acquires van der Waals interaction to the framework. In addition, our theoretical prediction shows a Ti(IV) site can undergo electronic hopping to become Ti(III) under the effect of visible light (~440–443 nm). Then, Ti(III) is capable of breaking the C-Br bond in ethyl α-bromophenylacetate spontaneously, which in turn activates the polymerization of methyl methacrylate with an energy barrier of 0.30 eV. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We are grateful for computational support from the High-Performance Computing Laboratory, Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Technology, Vietnam National University and the Institute for Material Research, Tohoku University.

The overall values of α<inf>T</inf>, α<inf>R</inf>, and α<inf>T</inf>/α<inf>R</inf> were 7.05%, 4.38%, and 1.64, respectively. The variation pattern in α<inf>T</inf> and α<inf>R</inf> was found to increase gradually from pith to bark and this trend was similar on both sites. In radial direction, the α<inf>T</inf>/α<inf>R</inf> decreased significantly from 10 to 50% of the radial length from pith before approaching a constant value toward the outside. The transverse shrinkage variation with height was very small and without statistical significance. There were strong positive relationships between transverse shrinkage and basic density (BD). This implies that the selection for high wood density may lead to increase wood transverse shrinkage. In addition, the α<inf>T</inf> and α<inf>R</inf> had significant positive linear relationships with both acoustic wave velocity (V<inf>L</inf>) and dynamic modulus of elasticity of log (DMOE<inf>log</inf>).

The O<inf>2</inf> concentrations included 21%, 15% and 10% O<inf>2</inf>, while the injection pressures were 80 and 120 MPa. The experimental fuels were the diesel fuel (B7), the neat HVO, the 20%, 50% and 80% HVO (by mass fraction) blended with the diesel. The experiments were carried out in a rapid compression-expansion machine (RCEM) under the direct injection (DI) diesel combustion condition. The analysis was undertaken using the two-color method. The experimental results indicated that the ignition delay, the heat release rate, the flame temperature, the soot density-KL factor, the NO<inf>x</inf> and soot-out emissions were inversely correlated to the HVO fraction in the blend. In addition, the findings revealed the similar flame profiles in which the higher flame temperature region and the darker KL density were concentrated around the spray flame upstream, regardless of the HVO mixing ratio.

Nevertheless, the higher pressure differential (i.e. between the injection pressure and the ambient pressure) contributed to the shorter ignition delay, higher heat release rate, early peak of the flame temperature, wider combustion area, faster soot oxidation rate and higher NO<inf>x</inf> production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diesel combustion; High injection pressure; Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO); NOx-soot emissions; Two-color method","Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Dust; Fuels; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Temperature measurement; Vegetable oils; Diesel combustion; High injection pressures; Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO); Soot emissions; Two-color method; Direct injection","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Thailand's King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang's Research Fund (Grant No. KREF125615) and the AUN/SEED-Net program under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Monitoring mangrove forests biomass accurately still remains challenging compared to other forest ecosystems. We investigated the usability of machine learning techniques for the estimation of AGB of mangrove plantation at a coastal area of Hai Phong city (Vietnam). The study employed a GIS database and support vector regression (SVR) to build and verify a model of AGB, drawing upon data from a survey in 25 sampling plots and an integration of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) dual-polarization horizontal transmitting and horizontal receiving (HH) and horizontal transmitting and vertical receiving (HV) and Sentinel-2A multispectral data. The performance of the model was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and leave-one-out cross-validation. Usability of the SVR model was assessed by comparing with four state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, i.e. radial basis function neural networks, multi-layer perceptron neural networks, Gaussian process, and random forest. The SVR model shows a satisfactory result (R2 = 0.596, RMSE = 0.187, MAE = 0.123) and outperforms the four machine learning models. The SVR model-estimated AGB ranged between 36.22 and 230.14 Mg ha−1 (average = 87.67 Mg ha−1).

In this study, we considered mental workload from a secondary task as a potential source of cognitive distraction and aimed to estimate the increased cognitive load on the driver with a four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device by introducing a machine-learning method for hemodynamic data. To produce added cognitive workload in a driver beyond just driving, two levels of an auditory presentation n-back task were used. A total of 60 experimental data sets from the NIRS device during two driving tasks were obtained and analyzed by machine-learning algorithms. We used two techniques to prevent overfitting of the classification models: (1) k-fold cross-validation and principal-component analysis, and (2) retaining 25% of the data (testing data) for testing of the model after classification. Six types of classifier were trained and tested: decision tree, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, the support vector machine, the nearest neighbor classifier, and the ensemble classifier. Cognitive workload levels were well classified from the NIRS data in the cases of subject-dependent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 81.30 to 95.40%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data was 82.18 to 96.08%), subject 26 independent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 84.90 to 89.50%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data increased from 84.08 to 89.91%), and channel-independent classification (classification 82.90%, prediction 82.74%). NIRS data in conjunction with an artificial intelligence method can therefore be used to classify mental workload as a source of potential cognitive distraction in real time under naturalistic conditions; this information may be utilized in driver assistance systems to prevent road accidents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Classification; Cognitive distraction; Driver attention; Mental workload; Near-infrared spectroscopy","article; artificial intelligence; attention; decision tree; discriminant analysis; driver; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; n-back test; near infrared spectroscopy; prediction; principal component analysis; support vector machine; traffic accident; validation process; workload","","","This study was partially supported by DENSO CORPORATION and by the Center of Innovation Program (Nagoya University COI: Mobility Innovation Center) from Japan Science and Technology Agency.","Abdelnour, Farras, Real-time imaging of human brain function by near-infrared spectroscopy using an adaptive general linear model, NeuroImage, 46, 1, pp. 133-143, (2009); Aghajani, Haleh, Measuring mental workload with EEG+fNIRS, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 11, (2017); Driver Workload Metrics Task 2 Final Report, (2006); Identification of Cognitive Load in Naturalistic Driving, (2015); J Transp Technol, (2017); Le, Anh Son, Effect of mental workload and aging on driver distraction based on the involuntary eye movement, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 484, pp. 349-359, (2017); Futur Act Saf Technol Towar Zero Traffic Accid Conf, (2017); Le, Anh Son, Towards online detection of driver distraction: Eye-movement simulation based on a combination of vestibulo–ocular reflex and optokinetic reflex models, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 65, pp. 716-729, (2019); Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference University Village, (2016); Proceedings of the 2017 Japan Society Automotive Engineers Annual Congress, (2017)","","Frontiers Media S.A. info@frontiersin.org","","","","","","16625161","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056851514"

Systematic metalation is considered with various cations (i.e., Ni2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+). Utilizing the advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we observe that the imidazole linking units suffer severe deformation in the ast and pts networks, as pointed out by the negative phonon modes. The mechanical stability is then verified by analyzing the elastic tensors (C<inf>ij</inf>), and we conclude four structures to acquire mechanical stability: pth-1 (NiMn), pth-2 (NiCo), pth-3 (NiZn), and pth-6 (CuZn). Electronic structure analysis suggests the first two structures to exhibit strong magnetism, whereas the latter are weakly or even nonpolarized, which establishes good agreement with the ligand-field theory prediction. The band gaps of those structures fall in the range of 0.74 to 1.78 eV, as estimated by conventional DFT calculations. Finally, we investigate the CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity over N<inf>2</inf> within pth-1 and pth-3 by conducting grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for gas adsorption. For the pth-1 (NiMn) and pth-3 (NiZn) cases, the load of CO<inf>2</inf> dominantly exceeds the uptake of N<inf>2</inf> at the pressure up to 1 bar, indicating those structure to be promising in CO<inf>2</inf> capture and selectivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Design for testability; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Gas adsorption; Intelligent systems; Manganese alloys; Mechanical stability; Monte Carlo methods; Topology; Building blockes; CO2 selectivity; DFT calculation; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Ligand field theory; Severe Deformation; Topological category; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Density functional theory","","","H.L.N. expresses gratitude to Dr. Hiroyasu Furukawa (University of California, Berkeley) and Dr. Felipe Gańdara (Materials Science Institute of Madrid, CSIC, Spain) for the initial discussion in this work.

Investigation of the evolutionary history of such organs should provide important clues for understanding the basis for species diversification. An Asian natricine snake, Rhabdophis tigrinus, possesses a series of unusual organs, called nuchal glands, which contain cardiotonic steroid toxins known as bufadienolides. Rhabdophis tigrinus sequesters bufadienolides from its toad prey and stores them in the nuchal glands as a defensive mechanism. Among more than 3,500 species of snakes, only 17 Asian natricine species are known to possess nuchal glands or their homologues. These 17 species belong to three nominal genera, Balanophis, Macropisthodon, and Rhabdophis. In Macropisthodon and Rhabdophis, however, species without nuchal glands also exist. To infer the evolutionary history of the nuchal glands, we investigated the molecular phylogenetic relationships among Asian natricine species with and without nuchal glands, based on variations in partial sequences of Mt-CYB, Cmos, and RAG1 (total 2,767 bp). Results show that all species with nuchal glands belong to a single clade (NGC). Therefore, we infer that the common ancestor of this clade possessed nuchal glands with no independent origins of the glands within the members. Our results also imply that some species have secondarily lost the glands. Given the estimated divergence time of related species, the ancestor of the nuchal gland clade emerged 19.18 mya. Our study shows that nuchal glands are fruitful subjects for exploring the evolution of novel organs. In addition, our analysis indicates that reevaluation of the taxonomic status of the genera Balanophis and Macropisthodon is required. We propose to assign all species belonging to the NGC to the genus Rhabdophis, pending further study. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Balanophis; Macropisthodon; molecular phylogenetics; Natricinae; nuchal glands; Rhabdophis","","","","Funding text 1: of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan for permits to collect snakes in Taiwan and for the export permit to Kyoto University (Permit No. AGF4X104070012); and to the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Sri Lanka for permits to collect snakes in Sri Lanka and for the export permit to Kyoto University.

ST biosynthesis has been shown to be affected by various regulatory factors. In this study, we investigated the involvement of O-mannosyltransferases (PmtA, PmtB, PmtC), in ST production and morphological development. Deletion of pmtA (ΔpmtA), pmtB (ΔpmtB) or pmtC (ΔpmtC) caused no spore production and a significant decline of vegetative growth. A tremendous decline of ST level was observed in all Δpmt mutants at the third day after inoculation. By extending the growth period, ST production of ΔpmtA and ΔpmtB increased to the wild-type level 7 days after inoculation. On the other hand, ST was not detected from 7- or 14-day cultures in ΔpmtC. Expression levels of aflR gene, an essential regulator of the ST biosynthesis pathway, were also down-regulated in the Δpmt strains. By introducing the aflR overexpression cassette, ST production in the ΔpmtA and ΔpmtB significantly increased to levels comparable to the wild type. However, the presence of the aflR overexpression cassette could not improve ST production in the ΔpmtC mutant. These data suggest that the PMT family is a new endogenous factor that is required for ST biosynthesis in A. nidulans. These findings provide better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of AF/ST biosynthesis, which can ultimately contribute to our ability to control aflatoxin contamination. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AflR; Pmt; Regulation; Secondary metabolite","fungal enzyme; mannosyltransferase; o mannosyltransferase PmtA; o mannosyltransferase PmtB; o mannosyltransferase PmtC; sterigmatocystin; unclassified drug; carcinogen; isoenzyme; protein O-mannosyltransferase; Article; Aspergillus nidulans; controlled study; fungal development; fungus growth; fungus mutant; fungus spore; gene cassette; gene deletion; gene overexpression; inoculation; nonhuman; priority journal; toxin synthesis; vegetative growth; biosynthesis; enzymology; fungal gene; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; genetic complementation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; Carcinogens; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Genes, Fungal; Genetic Complementation Test; Isoenzymes; Mannosyltransferases; Mutation; Sterigmatocystin","","mannosyltransferase, 9055-06-5; sterigmatocystin, 10048-13-2; Carcinogens; Isoenzymes; Mannosyltransferases; protein O-mannosyltransferase; Sterigmatocystin","Funding text 1: We are grateful to Nancy Keller of the University of Wisconsin–Madison for strains and Heng Chooi of the University of Western Australia for the plasmid pYellow.

The hourly concentration data of PM<inf>2.5</inf> agreed well with corresponding data obtained with a beta attenuation monitor located 3 km away, with R2 = 0.73. The monthly variation showed that levels of PM<inf>2.5</inf> were high during the dry season, particularly in December (median = 62 µg m–3) and low during the rainy season, particularly in June and July (medians = 19 µg m–3). Haze episodes of PM<inf>2.5</inf> with levels higher than 100 µg m–3 were observed 13 times during the dry season (October 2016–March 2017). These episodes may be linked to the East Asian winter monsoon, as the daily levels of PM<inf>2.5</inf> and CO increased several days after most of the cold surge events. Two events were investigated further at a higher temporal resolution. For both events, peaks of PM<inf>2.5</inf> appeared at midnight for some days after a cold surge, while CO levels often increased during rush hours. For the first event, brief peaks of PM<inf>2.5</inf> with a high rate of increase (~5 µg m–3 min–1) were observed, highlighting the importance of a high temporal resolution for PM<inf>2.5</inf> sensors in assessing health effects.

However, the mangrove forest ecosystem of this reserve has suffered severe degradation due to its partial conversion to shrimp aquaculture. The restoration of the mangroves is expected to play an important role in dealing with climate change impacts, given their ability to mitigate the impact of tropical storms. This study examined the factors influencing the willingness to pay (WTP) for mangrove restoration in the context of climate change in the mangrove forest ecosystems of the Cat Ba Biosphere Reserve (CBBR), Vietnam. We employed a contingent valuation method to estimate household WTP for mangrove restoration, drawing upon data from a survey of 205 respondents in four villages in the buffer and transition zones of the biosphere reserve where mangrove forests are found. The mean WTP is estimated to be 192,780 VND (US$8.64), while the total annual benefit from the mangrove conservation programs of the CBBR is estimated at 712.3 million VND (US$31,943). The results revealed that gender, education level, occupation, the participation of respondents in mangrove restoration activities, and their attitudes toward the impact of climate change were significant factors in their WTP for mangrove restoration. Since mangroves can significantly contribute to mitigating climate change impacts by easing the effect of tropical storms and protecting dyke systems, the local government of Hai Phong City should implement the necessary regulations and policies to conserve the mangrove forests of the Biosphere Reserve. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cat Ba biosphere reserve; Climate change; Hai Phong City; Mangrove restoration; Vietnam; Willingness to pay","Biospherics; Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Storms; Surveys; Tropics; Biosphere reserve; Cat ba biosphere reserve; Climate change impact; Forest ecosystem; Hai phong city; Mangrove forest; Mangrove restoration; Tropical storms; Viet Nam; Willingness to pay; Restoration; archipelago; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; environmental restoration; forest ecosystem; local government; mangrove; nature reserve; public attitude; restoration ecology; UNESCO; valuation; willingness to pay; Cat Ba Island; Hai Phong; Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhizophoraceae","","","This research was partly supported by the Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, the University of Tsukuba, Japan .

This study investigates the mechanism and the entire process of rainfall-induced deep-seated landslides forming two massive dams in the Kuridaira and Akatani valleys, respectively. The mechanism of the rapid deep-seated landslides is examined through a series of laboratory experiments on samples from sliding surfaces by using undrained high-stress dynamic-loading ring-shear apparatus. The test results indicate that the failure of samples is triggered by excess pore water pressure generation under a shear displacement from 2 to 7 mm with a pore pressure ratio ranging from 0.33 to 0.37. The rapid movement of landslides is mainly attributed to high mobility due to the liquefaction behavior of both sandstone-rich and shale samples. Geomorphic settings and landslide mobility are major contributing factors to the dam formation. Additionally, shear displacement control tests show that a certain amount of shear displacement between 2 and 7 mm along the sliding surfaces of the gravitationally deformed slopes might have led to the failures. Importantly, computer simulation with LS-RAPID software using input parameters obtained from physical experiments is employed to interpret the entire formation process of the abovementioned two landslide dams. The simulation results are examined in accordance with the observed on-site geomorphic features and recorded data to explain the possibility of sliding processes. The results further point out that local failures are initiated from the lower middle part of the landslide bodies where the geological boundary exists. This condition most probably influences the landslide initiation in the two case studies. This research is therefore helpful for hazard assessment of slopes that are susceptible to deep-seated landslides and other sequential processes in areas with geology and geomorphology similar to that of the Kii Peninsula. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Akatani; Deep-seated rapid landslide; Kii Peninsula; Kuridaira; Landslide dam; LS-RAPID; Rainfall; Ring-shear apparatus","Computer software; Dams; Displacement control; Dynamic loads; Geology; Pore pressure; Rain; Stress analysis; Akatani; Kii Peninsula; Kuridaira; Landslide dam; LS-RAPID; Ring shear; Landslides; computer simulation; cyclic loading; dam; displacement; failure analysis; fracture initiation; geomorphology; induced response; landslide; liquefaction; porewater; rainfall; shale; sliding; software; Honshu; Japan; Kinki","","","This research was financially supported by the Leading Graduate School Program on Global Survivability Studies (GSS Program) in Kyoto University.

This study investigated the nutrient composition of so-called organic fertilizers in Vietnam's markets and issues related to their production, and evaluated their potential to contaminate the groundwater. We analyzed the physicochemical properties of 12 domestic and four imported products of the fertilizers, and conducted a cultivation experiment in sandy soil with the fertilizer applied at a rate of 200 mg N kg-1 soil using an automatic watering apparatus in a greenhouse. We further studied the production of an ""organic fertilizer"" from coffee by-products. The nutrient content greatly varied among domestic products, whereas they were quite similar among imported products. The product packaging of the collected samples lacked information regarding raw materials. Two thirds of the domestic products contained over 30% of the total N in the inorganic form, implying that the N content dramatically increased in the fertilizers rather than in their supposed raw materials. The stages involved in the production were composting, the addition of extra soil as a bulking agent, and the mixing-in of chemical substances to increase the nutrient content before packing. The remarkably high ratio of inorganic N to total N was attributed to excessive N leaching from soil by the application of domestic fertilizers. These results suggested the need for quality criteria guidelines for organic fertilizers in Vietnam that underline not only nutrient levels, but also the control of raw materials and production process of compost, because they are closely related to nutrient uptake and the leaching loss of nutrients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coffee by-products; N leaching; Nutrient composition; Production; So-called organic fertilizer","byproduct; chemical substance; crop production; developing world; fertilizer; groundwater pollution; leaching; market conditions; nutrient loss; nutrient uptake; physicochemical property; sandy soil; Viet Nam","","","Funding: This research was funded by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and the Research Grant for Encouragement of Students, Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Japan.","Parvathi, Priyanka, Fair Trade and Organic Agriculture in Developing Countries: A Review, Journal of International Food and Agribusiness Marketing, 25, 4, pp. 311-323, (2013); Rehber, Erkan, Prospects and challenges for developing countries in trade and production of organic food and fibers: The case of Turkey, British Food Journal, 104, pp. 371-390, (2002); Proceedings of the 4th Ansoftworkshop Gwangju, (2012); Production and Supply Chain Management of Organic Food in Vietnam; undefined; Proceedings of the Asian Soil Partnership Consultationworkshop on Sustainable Management and Protection of Soil Resources Bangkok Thailand 13 15 May 2015; Proceedings of the Japan Vietnam Research Workshop on Sustainable Society Development in Asian Countries Talking Climate Change, (2015); Vu, Quyet Manh, Socio-economic and biophysical determinants of land degradation in Vietnam: An integrated causal analysis at the national level, Land Use Policy, 36, pp. 605-617, (2014); Nguyen, Trung Thanh, Does land tenure security promote manure use by farm households in Vietnam?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 8, 2, (2016); Ho, Thong Quoc, Eco-efficiency analysis of sustainability-certified coffee production in Vietnam, Journal of Cleaner Production, 183, pp. 251-260, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049897991"

Long waiting time is a major dissatisfaction for patients. Reducing waiting time benefits not only patients but also hospitals in decreasing overall workload. To identify factors contributing to long waiting time in outpatient clinics, a cross-sectional study was conducted at a national hospital in Vietnam. The time for each process of 7,931 patients who visited the outpatient clinics within Thong Nhat Hospital from 5 to 9 September 2016 was collected from the computerized clinical database. Characteristics of patients (age, sex, address, day of visit, registration time, visited department and test) and waiting times were studied at the outcome measures. Multivariate analyses using the linear regression model was carried out to evaluate the contribution of these factors to the total waiting time. Among 7,931 patients, 52.3% were women, 46.3% were 60-80 years, and 64.8% registered between 5:30 and 9:30. The mean total waiting time was 104.1 minutes. The analysis on total waiting time among 4,564 patients who visited one department without any test showed that department group and registration time were significantly associated with a total waiting time. In 1,259 patients who visited one department with one test, early registration and undergoing blood tests were significantly associated with a longer total waiting time. These results showed that old age, visiting internal medicine departments, early registration time, and undergoing blood tests were factors contributing to a longer total waiting time in the outpatient clinics within Thong Nhat Hospital. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Outpatient clinic; Overcrowding; Vietnam; Waiting time","adult; article; cross-sectional study; crowding (area); female; human; internal medicine; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; outpatient department; Viet Nam","","","We would like to express sincere gratitude to Young Leaders’ Program, Nagoya University which is supported by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

For this purpose, ALOS PALSAR imagery for the above period and GIS data were collected and used, and then, spatial distributions of mangrove species were derived using logistic model tree (LMT) classifier. The LMT is current state-of-the-art machine learning method that has not been used for mapping of mangrove species. The results showed that incorporation of ALOS PALSAR imagery and GIS in the LMT algorithm provides satisfactory overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The ALOS-2 PALSAR for 2015 achieved better overall accuracy, with an increment of 3.6% in mapping mangrove species than that of the ALOS PALSAR for 2010. The ALOS-2 PALSAR-derived model yielded the overall accuracy of 83.8% and the kappa coefficient of 0.81, compared with those of the ALOS PALSAR-derived model, 80.2% and 0.78, respectively. The results of classification for 2010 and 2015 were significantly different using the McNemar test.

The van der Waals interaction was also taken into account to include the non-local electron correlation in the calculation of structural parameters and voltage. The diffusion of Na ions is treated as a process of the Na vacancy-positive small polaron complex in NaVOPO<inf>4</inf> and the Na ion-negative small polaron complex in VOPO<inf>4</inf>, respectively. During the charging (discharging) process, the removal (insertion) of a Na ion would result in the formation of a positive (negative) small polaron at one of the two first nearest vanadium sites to the Na vacancy. Three elementary diffusion processes, including the single, crossing and parallel diffusion processes, are explored. It is found that the [010] direction is preferable for Na ion diffusion in both the charging and discharging processes. The influence of small polaron migration on Na ion diffusion in the charging state is negligible, whereas such effect is considerably strong in the discharging process. Moreover, while three elementary diffusion processes in NaVOPO<inf>4</inf> require the same energy, the parallel diffusion process in VOPO<inf>4</inf> is not preferred. The diffusion of Na vacancy accompanied by a positive polaron in the full charging process requires an activation energy of 395 meV, while the diffusion of Na ion accompanied by a negative polaron in the discharging state, VOPO<inf>4</inf>, has a higher activation energy of 627 meV. With a voltage and activation barrier similar to that of the olivine phosphate LiFePO<inf>4</inf>, these sodium-based materials are expected to be promising cathode materials for sodium ion batteries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Vietnam Project on the Establishment of the Master's in Nanotechnology Program of Vietnam-Japan University under the contract between Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Osaka University.

This disease is primarily caused by the two closely related serotypes of Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). Here, we analyse Japanese virologic and syndromic surveillance time-series data from 1982 to 2015. As in some other countries in the Asia Pacific region, EV-A71 in Japan has a 3 year cyclical component, whereas CV-A16 is predominantly annual. We observe empirical signatures of an inhibitory interaction between the serotypes; virologic lines of evidence suggest they may indeed interact immunologically. We fit the time series to mechanistic epidemiological models: as a first-order effect, we find the data consistent with single-serotype susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics. We then extend the modelling to incorporate an inhibitory interaction between serotypes. Our results suggest the existence of a transient cross-protection and possible asymmetry in its strength such that CV-A16 serves as a stronger forcing on EV-A71. Allowing for asymmetry yields accurate out-of-sample predictions and the directionality of this effect is consistent with the virologic literature. Confirmation of these hypothesized interactions would have important implications for understanding enterovirus epidemiology and informing vaccine development. Our results highlight the general implication that even subtle interactions could have qualitative impacts on epidemic dynamics and predictability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Epidemiological modelling; Hand-foot-mouth disease; Multi-strain dynamics; Non-polio enteroviruses","Epidemiology; Time series; Asia Pacific region; Epidemiological modelling; Epidemiological models; Foot and mouth disease; Multi strains; Non-polio enteroviruses; Syndromic surveillance; Vaccine development; Dynamics; Article; Coxsackievirus A16; cross protection; epidemic; hand foot and mouth disease; human; Japan; nonhuman; periodicity; sentinel surveillance; serotype; time series analysis; virus transmission; wavelet analysis; computer simulation; Enterovirus; time factor; virology; virus antigen; Antigens, Viral; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Serogroup; Time Factors","","Antigens, Viral","This work is supported by the Center for Health & Wellbeing, Princeton University (S.T.), the University of Tokyo-Princeton Strategic Partnership (S.T., C.J.E.M., B.T.G.), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (C.J.E.M., B.T.G.), the Wellcome Trust (H.R.v.D., T.L.V., J.J.F.) and the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics program of the Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security and the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health (C.J.E.M., B.T.G.).","Shimizu, Hiroyuki, Enterovirus 71 from fatal and nonfatal cases of hand, foot and mouth disease epidemics in Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan in 1997-1998, Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases, 52, 1, pp. 12-15, (1999); Xing, Weijia, Hand, foot, and mouth disease in China, 2008-12: An epidemiological study, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 14, 4, pp. 308-318, (2014); Wang, Yu, Hand, foot, and mouth disease in China: Patterns of spread and transmissibility, Epidemiology, 22, 6, pp. 781-792, (2011); A Guide to Clinical Management and Public Health Response for Hand Foot and Mouth Disease Hfmd, (2011); Wpro Hand Foot and Mouth Disease Hfmd, (2018); Tagaya, Isamu, Epidemic of hand, foot and mouth disease in japan, Japanese Journal of Medical Science and Biology, 26, 3, pp. 143-147, (1973); Akiyoshi, Kyoko, Enteroviruses in patients experiencing multiple episodes of hand, foot, and mouth disease in the same season in Kobe, Japan, 2011, Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases, 65, 5, pp. 459-461, (2012); Ooi, Monghow, Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of enterovirus 71, The Lancet Neurology, 9, 11, pp. 1097-1105, (2010); Li, Rongcheng, An inactivated enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy children, New England Journal of Medicine, 370, 9, pp. 829-837, (2014); Zhu, Fengcai, Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of an enterovirus 71 vaccine in China, New England Journal of Medicine, 370, 9, pp. 818-828, (2014)","","Royal Society Publishing sales@royalsoc.ac.uk","","","","","","17425689; 17425662","","","30209044","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053374513"

Unlike existing works, the difference between neutral surface and mid-surface of FGM plates is taken into account in the present study. The kinematics of plate is based on first order shear deformation theory, while the crack is simulated by variational phase-field theory. The critical buckling temperature rises of cracked FGM plate is calculated, and the obtained results are then compared with those derived from extended isogeometric analysis by the authors and other numerical methods. We analyze the thermal buckling of cracked FGM plates for both cases: (a) the mid-surface coincides neutral surface, and (b) they are different between each other, and then showing their influence. We also investigate the effects of boundary condition and material properties on thermal buckling of cracked FGM plate. Through these results, it reveals the necessity to consider the difference between neutral surface and mid-surface in thermal buckling analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crack; Functionally graded material; Mindlin; Neutral surface; Phase field model; Thermal buckling","Beams and girders; Cracks; Functionally graded materials; Numerical methods; Phase interfaces; Plates (structural components); Shear deformation; First-order shear deformation theory; Functionally graded composites; Functionally graded material (FGM); Isogeometric analysis; Mindlin; Neutral surfaces; Phase field models; Thermal buckling; Buckling","","","NDD gratefully acknowledges the supports of Vietnam National University (VNU) under Project No. QG.17.45 .

In this (p,n)-type reaction, it is expected that GT states with T=0, 1, and 2 are excited. An energy resolution of ΔE=23 keV allowed us to study many discrete states. Most of the prominent states showed 0-peaked angular distributions, which suggested that they are the states excited by ΔL=0 GT transitions. Candidates of GT states were studied up to an excitation energy Ex=18.5 MeV. The reduced GT transition strengths, B(GT), were derived assuming the proportionality between cross sections and B(GT) values. Standard B(GT) values were obtained form the Si26β decay, where the mirror symmetry of Tz=±1→0 GT transitions was assumed. The GT strength, as a whole, is divided in two energy regions: the region of up to 8.5 MeV and the higher-energy region of 8.5-12.8 MeV, where the strength in the latter region distributed like a resonance. The obtained GT strength distribution is compared with the results of random phase approximation calculations. The T=2 GT states are expected in the region Ex≥13.5 MeV. By comparing with the results of (n,p)-type Mg26(d,He2)Na26 and Mg26(t,He3)Na26 reactions, the isospin symmetry of T=2 GT states is discussed. Owing to the high-energy resolution, we could study the decay widths Γ for the states in the Ex>9 MeV region. The T=2 state at 13.592 MeV is not noticeably wider than the experimental energy resolution. The narrow width of the state is explained in terms of isospin selection rules. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The ( He 3 , t ) experiments were performed at RCNP, Osaka University under the Experimental Program E294.

Five discs were collected at 0.3-, 1.3-, 3.3-, 5.3-, and 7.3-m heights above the ground. The estimated mean GRW, SG, FL, and MFA were 7.44 mm, 0.548, 1.07 mm, and 14.65°, respectively. There were significant (P < 0.05) differences among trees and between sites in SG, FL, and MFA. Longitudinal position significantly (P < 0.05) influenced GRW and SG. Radial position was highly (P < 0.001) significant to all the wood properties and contributed the highest (GRW: 52.58%, SG: 58.49%, FL: 77.83%, and MFA: 26.20%) of the total variations. FL and SG increased from pith to bark, while GRW and MFA decreased from pith to bark. Fiber length increment (FLI) tends to stabilize between 7th and 10th rings.

Model simulations were conducted for the SEA domain at 36 km spatial resolution for the period of 1989–2008, as part of the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling/Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-Southeast Asia (SEACLID/CORDEX-Southeast Asia) project. A total of 18 sensitivity experiments were conducted with a combination of six cumulus parameterization schemes and three ocean surface flux schemes. The model's skill in representing mean, maximum and minimum temperatures is evaluated against observed gridded data sets. Results indicate a predominant cold bias in all simulations, particularly over mainland SEA (Indochina) during the season of December to February. Nevertheless, the seasonal correlation is highest over this region. The cold bias of the model is also evident in the temperature distributions, such that there are more cold months than observed, which may be associated with the underestimation of the daily maximum temperature. A few simulations also reveal a warm bias over some areas in the Maritime Continent. Further examination shows that both radiative and surface fluxes influence the simulated temperature, which may also have effects that partially offset each other in some areas. Comparison of the sensitivity experiments reveals differences in model performance, and underlines the importance in choosing the appropriate configuration for RegCM4.3 before it is used to downscale climate projections, particularly for the SEA region. This study also shows a strong influence of the choice of cumulus scheme on temperature. Based on performance metrics for temperature among the schemes tested, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Emanuel cumulus scheme and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme version 1e (BATS1e) ocean surface flux scheme can be used in future simulations for the region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CORDEX; model evaluation; RegCM4; Southeast Asia; temperature","Climate models; Clouds; Surface measurement; Temperature; CORDEX; Cumulus parameterization schemes; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Model evaluation; RegCM4; Regional climate modeling; Southeast Asia; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; climate modeling; cumulus; parameterization; regional climate; sea surface; sensitivity analysis","","","Funding text 1: This research is funded by the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (ARCP2013-17NMY-Tangang/ST-2013-017, ARCP2014-07CMY-Tangang/ST-2015-003, ARCP2015-04CMY-Tangang/ST-2015-003).

In order to alleviate the impact of faults, fault tolerance has been investigated in the recent years to enhance NoC's robustness. Due to the vast selection of fault-tolerance mechanisms and critical design constraints, selecting and configuring an appropriate mechanism to satisfy the fault-tolerance requirements constitute new challenges for designers. Consequently, reliability assessment has become prominent for the early stages of manufacturing process to solve these problems. This paper approaches the fault-tolerance analysis by providing an analytical model to approximate the lifetime reliability and compares it with a system-level simulation. Based on the proposed approach, we measure the fault-tolerance efficiency using a new parameter, named reliability acceleration factor. The goal of this paper is to provide an efficient and accurate reliability assessment to help designers easily understand and evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of their potential fault-tolerance methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytical model; architecture and design; fault tolerance; reliability analysis","Analytical models; Distributed computer systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Fits and tolerances; Network-on-chip; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Routers; VLSI circuits; Comprehensive reliability assessment; Fault tolerance mechanisms; Fault tolerant systems; Fault-tolerance analysis; Reliability assessments; Reliability engineering; Routing; System level simulation; Fault tolerance","","","Manuscript received February 1, 2017; revised May 2, 2017 and June 24, 2017; accepted July 30, 2017.

In the past 5 years, major research activity on RSV has yielded substantial new data from developing countries. With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015. Methods We estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies. We estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population estimates. We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies. We also estimated overall RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and RSV activity. Findings We estimated that globally in 2015, 33·1 million (uncertainty range [UR] 21·6–50·3) episodes of RSV-ALRI, resulted in about 3·2 million (2·7–3·8) hospital admissions, and 59 600 (48 000–74 500) in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years. In children younger than 6 months, 1·4 million (UR 1·2–1·7) hospital admissions, and 27 300 (UR 20 700–36 200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI. We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI mortality could be as high as 118 200 (UR 94 600–149 400). Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any given population. Interpretation Globally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services. About 45% of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months. An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group.

However, recent molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that they often display a clear geographic genetic structure or even form a geographically fragmented species complex. These genetic divergences can be facilitated by the presence of dispersal barriers such as oceanic currents and/or by the limitation of suitable habitats. Using comprehensive phylogenetic analyses, we evaluate how such dispersal barriers shape genetic divergence and speciation in the intertidal snail genus Monodonta. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed various patterns of cladogenesis in Monodonta in East Asia. Genetic segregation between the Japanese and Ryukyu Archipelagos are detected in M. labio and M. perplexa perplexa. However, the relationship of geographical border and lineages does not correspond to those two because they show different habitat preference. M. labio distributed in the Japanese mainland is separated by the boundary corresponding to the point from which oceanic currents split into different directions. In contrast, species inhabiting various environments such as M. confusa are not genetically separated in Japan. In the peripheral oceanic Ogasawara Islands, two Monodonta species form each endemic lineage, although these two underwent different colonization processes to the islands. These findings suggest that the genus Monodonta has been genetically diversified around Japan, probably due to its correlations with dispersal ability, oceanic current, and habitat preferences. These factors may be effective causes for diversification of marine gastropods with a planktonic stage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Gastropoda; Monodonta; Monodonta confusa; Monodonta labio; Monodonta perplexa perplexa","","","Funding text 1: Yamazaki for checking English grammar before using English editing service.

Recently, there has been a significant focus on automatic calibration. In this paper, two evolutionary optimization algorithms were applied to calibration of the long- and short-term runoff model (LST model) to simulate the daily rainfall–runoff process in the Be River catchment located in southern Vietnam. The differential evolution (DE) and evolution strategy (ES) algorithms were employed to optimize three objective functions: the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error, and mean absolute error, which are indices for evaluating the simulation accuracy of the LST model. Hydrometeorological data for the periods 1985–1989 and 1990–1991 were used for calibration and validation, respectively. The LST model was calibrated for each objective function using five different parent and offspring population conditions. The results show that both the DE and ES algorithms are efficient methods for automatic calibration of the LST model. After 1000 generations, the best values of the fitness indices found by the DE technique were slightly better and more stable than those found by the ES technique in both calibration and validation. The average computation time for each generation using the DE algorithm was approximately two-thirds as long as that using the ES algorithm. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Differential evolution; Evolution strategy; LST model; Optimization; Parameter calibration; Rainfall–runoff model","Calibration; Catchments; Efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Mean square error; Rain; Runoff; Calibration and validations; Differential Evolution; Evolution strategies; Evolutionary optimization algorithm; Hydrometeorological data; Parameter calibration; Root mean square errors; Runoff model; Optimization; accuracy assessment; algorithm; calibration; catchment; comparative study; efficiency measurement; hydrological modeling; model validation; optimization; parameter estimation; rainfall-runoff modeling; Be River; Viet Nam","","","The authors would like to thank the Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho) and Okayama University for their funding support and for providing the study program.

However, little information is known about the response of indica cultivars, especially Vietnamese cultivars, to high temperature. In this study, field experimentswere conducted in 2015 and 2016 to evaluate the response of Vietnamese cultivars under high temperatures during the grain filling period. The high temperature was applied after the first cultivar started anthesis, by opening two sides of a plastic chamber that housed the cultivar when the temperature reached above 36 °C under field conditions. The difference in the maximum temperature between the control and the high temperature treatment was about 1.3 °C to 10.1 °C in 2015, and 0.73 °C to 10.2 °C in 2016. Decreases in crop growth rate (CGR) and yield were correlated with increased temperature conditions during the grain filling period. The grain yield of 14 Vietnamese cultivars fell to 81.5 and 79.4% of the control in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The variable with the greatest impact on grain yield was spikelet sterility induced by high temperature. Under high temperature conditions during the grain filling period, the percentage of grain chalkiness in the high temperature-treatment group increased compared to the control. Our study showed that Vietnamese rice yield and quality were significantly affected by high temperature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chalkiness; Crop growth rate; Dry matter production; High temperature; Spikelet sterility; Vietnamese cultivar; Yield","","","","Acknowledgments: We thank Okayama University for funding the doctoral studies of the first author and MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology Japan) for their financial support.","Food Outlook Global Market Analysis, (2007); Cooper, Nora T.W., Effects of nighttime temperature during kernel development on rice physicochemical properties, Cereal Chemistry, 85, 3, pp. 276-282, (2008); Climate Change 2001 the Scientific Basis, (2001); Climate Change 2007 the Physical Science Basis, (2007); Poverty Poverty Reduction and Poverty Dynamics in Vietnam, (2006); Yin, Xinyou, Differential effects of day and night temperature on development to flowering in rice, Annals of Botany, 77, 3, pp. 203-213, (1996); Oh-e, Izumi, Effects of high temperature on growth, yield and dry-matter production of rice grown in the paddy field, Plant Production Science, 10, 4, pp. 412-422, (2007); Baker, Jeffrey T., Response of rice to carbon dioxide and temperature, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 60, 3-4, pp. 153-166, (1992); Jagadish, Krishna SV, High temperature stress and spikelet fertility in rice (Oryza sativa L.), Journal of Experimental Botany, 58, 7, pp. 1627-1635, (2007); Science of the Rice Plant, (1993)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20734395","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028694936"

Their genotype constellation, G1-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2, indicated that they were G1 VP7 mono-reassortants possessing DS-1-like genetic backbones. The two strains were ≧99.7% identical across the genome. While their VP7 genes were ≧99.7 identical to that of a Wa-like strain RVA/Human-wt/VNM/SP110/2012/G1P[8] which co-circulated during the 2012/2013 season, 10 genes were ≧99.8% identical to that of the DS-1-like strains RVA/Human-wt/VNM/SP015/2012/G2P[4] (and SP108) that co-circulated during the season. The identities were consistent with the phylogenetic relationships observed between the genes of the reassortants and those of the afore-mentioned strains. Consequently, the G1P[4] strains appear to have been generated by genetic reassortment between SP110-like and SP015-like strains. In conclusion, this study provides robust molecular evidence for the first time that G1P[4] strains detected in Hanoi Vietnam were generated by inter-genogroup reassortment between co-circulating G1P[8] and G2P[4] strains within the same place and season. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic reassortment; phylogeny; Rotavirus A; Vietnam","nonstructural protein 1; nonstructural protein 2; nonstructural protein 3; nonstructural protein 4; nonstructural protein 5; protein VP1; protein VP2; protein VP3; protein VP4; protein VP6; protein VP7; virus RNA; capsid protein; virus antigen; VP7 protein, Rotavirus; Article; controlled study; genetic reassortment; genotype; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; Rotavirus A; Viet Nam; virus gene; virus genome; virus strain; classification; genetic recombination; genetic variation; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human; Rotavirus; sequence analysis; Antigens, Viral; Capsid Proteins; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Genotype; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Phylogeny; Reassortant Viruses; Recombination, Genetic; RNA, Viral; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Vietnam","GENBANK: LC215251:LC215272","protein VP1, 92354-95-5; Antigens, Viral; Capsid Proteins; RNA, Viral; VP7 protein, Rotavirus","We acknowledge the considerable support of the Program for Nurturing Global Leaders in Tropical and Emerging Communicable Diseases, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University.

We examined the rate of total electron content change index (ROTI) obtained from GPS receivers in Southeast Asia, airglow images detected by an all-sky imager, and thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures obtained by a Fabry-Perot interferometer at Kototabang. Altitudes of the F layer (h′F) observed by ionosondes at Kototabang, Chiang Mai, and Chumphon were also surveyed. We found that the postmidnight FAIs occurred within plasma bubbles and coincided with kilometer-scale plasma density irregularities. We also observed an enhancement of the magnetically equatorward thermospheric neutral wind at the same time as the increase of h′F at low-latitude stations, but h′F at a station near the magnetic equator remained invariant. Simultaneously, a magnetically equatorward gradient of thermospheric temperature was identified at Kototabang. The convergence of equatorward neutral winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres could be associated with a midnight temperature maximum occurring around the magnetic equator. Equatorward neutral winds can uplift the F layer at low latitudes and increase the growth rate of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, causing more rapid extension of plasma bubbles. The equatorward winds in both hemispheres also intensify the eastward Pedersen current, so a large polarization electric field generated in the plasma bubble might play an important role in the generation of postmidnight FAIs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","neutral temperatures; postmidnight field-aligned irregularities; the Equatorial Atmosphere Radar; thermospheric neutral winds","","","","The EAR is operated by the Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere (RISH), Kyoto University, and the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN).

Fourteen participants died and six became untraceable by October 2013; the remaining 21 children were followed up from 2013 to 2015. Thirteen and seven participants had hearing and functional ophthalmological impairment, respectively. Developmental difficulties were suspected in 19 (95%) children who failed in at least one area of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and/or Denver II in 2013 and/or 2015. Developmental difficulties were frequently identified in the ASQ communication domain (n = 14 in 2013) and Denver II language area (n = 13 in 2013). Seven (41%) participants were suspected of having autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 2013 by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers. In 2015, proportions of children failing the problem-solving (62%) and personal-social (62%) domains had increased and two of 13 were diagnosed with ASD by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition.

Chemical molecules having a linear alignment are commonly seen in nature, such as carbon dioxide. A similar linear alignment of the nuclear clusters, referred to as linear-chain cluster state (LCCS), has been studied since the 1950s, however, up to now there is no clear experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of such a state. Recently, it was proposed that an excess of neutrons may offer just such a stabilizing mechanism, revitalizing interest in the nuclear LCCS, specifically with predictions for their emergence in neutron-rich carbon isotopes. Here we present the experimental observation of α-cluster states in the radioactive 14C nucleus. Using the Be10+α resonant scattering method with a radioactive beam, we observed a series of levels which completely agree with theoretically predicted levels having an explicit linear-chain cluster configuration. We regard this as the first strong indication of the linear-chain clustered nucleus. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Linear-chain cluster state; Nuclear cluster; Resonant elastic scattering; RI beam; Thick-target method in inverse kinematics","","","","We appreciate Prof. Y.

During a hospital-based study conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam, in the 2012-2013 rotavirus season, G1P[8] strains with a virtually identical short RNA migration pattern were detected in 20 (14%) of 141 rotavirus-positive samples. Two representatives of these strains were shown by whole-genome sequencing to be double-gene reassortants possessing the genotype constellation of G1-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. Sequencing and a database search revealed that these Vietnamese G1P[8] double-gene reassortant strains shared an immediate ancestor with a locally circulating G2P[4] strain in all of the inner-capsid and non-structural protein genes, whereas they were more closely related in the VP7 and VP4 genes to a Chinese G1P[8] strain and a Chinese G3P[8] strain, respectively, than to locally circulating G1P[8] strains. Despite the marked similarity between Japanese and Thai G1P[8] double-gene reassortant strains, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Vietnamese and Japanese/Thai G1P[8] double-gene reassortant strains originated from independent reassortment events. Clinically, children infected with Vietnamese G1P[8] double-gene reassortant strains experienced severe diarrhoea, but it was not more severe than that in children infected with ordinary G1P[8] strains. In conclusion, Vietnamese G1P[8] double-gene reassortant strains originated from a locally circulating G2P[4] strain and caused severe diarrhoea, but there was no evidence of increased virulence. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","child; classification; cross-sectional study; feces; female; gastroenteritis; genetic reassortment; genetic recombination; genetics; genotype; human; isolation and purification; male; molecular evolution; phylogeny; physiology; preschool child; Rotavirus; Rotavirus Infections; Viet Nam; virology; virus genome; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evolution, Molecular; Feces; Female; Gastroenteritis; Genome, Viral; Genotype; Humans; Male; Phylogeny; Reassortant Viruses; Recombination, Genetic; Vietnam","GENBANK: LC066147:LC066196, LC174963:LC174973","","Funding text 1: The authors thank the staff of the Department of Paediatrics, Saint Paul Hospital and Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam.

Since the country's budget is inadequate for investing in all necessary infrastructure projects, the Vietnam government has been inviting other economic sectors, especially the private sector, to participate in infrastructure development. The cooperation between the government agencies and the private entities, called Public-Private Partnership (PPP), must encounter various challenges leading to difficulties in attracting private investors. A main reason is that private investors must deal with critical risks concerning PPP investment environment. It is a challenging task for the government to optimally manage such risks to enhance the attractiveness of PPP projects for private investors. This paper examines the critical risk factors that influence the private sector's investment decisions on PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Risk factors inherent in typical PPP projects were compiled by comprehensive literature review. To reflect unique characteristics of PPP projects in Vietnam, the compiled risk factors were reviewed by a group of PPP experts from both the public and private sectors in Vietnam through in-depth interviews and questionnaire surveys. In addition, ten PPP project case studies in Vietnam were analyzed to derive the risk profile of PPP transportation projects of the nation. These risk factors were quantitatively assessed based on their probabilities and impact levels. We found that the critical risk factors of PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam are acquisition/compensation problems, approvals and permits, inadequate feasibility studies, finance market issues, subjective evaluation methods, and change in laws and regulations. By performing factor analysis, these critical risk factors were grouped into four categories: (1) bidding process, (2) finance issues, (3) laws and regulations, and (4) project evaluation issues. These critical risk factors represent the obstacles that repel private investors from PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. Thus, the Vietnam government agencies should meticulously address these issues to attract both domestic and foreign private investors in PPP projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors would like to thank the ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net), Chulalongkorn University, Kyoto University, and Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology for their financial support to this paper.","Public Private Partnership in Infrastructure Development Case Studies from Asia and Europe, (2009); Nguyen, Longduy, Large construction projects in developing countries: A case study from Vietnam, International Journal of Project Management, 22, 7, pp. 553-561, (2004); Thomas, Anu V., Modelling and assessment of critical risks in BOT road projects, Construction Management and Economics, 24, 4, pp. 407-424, (2006); Li, Bing, Critical success factors for PPP/PFI projects in the UK construction industry, Construction Management and Economics, 23, 5, pp. 459-471, (2005); Revival of Private Participation in Developing Country Infrastructure A Look at Recent Trends and Policy Implications, (2007); Flyvbjerg, Bent, Underestimating costs in public works projects: Error or lie?, Journal of the American Planning Association, 68, 3, pp. 279-295, (2002); Public Private Partnerships in Infrastructure Best Practices from International Experience and Applications for Thailand, (2008); Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Jabnoun, Naceur, Measuring perceived service quality at UAE commercial banks, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 20, 4, pp. 458-472, (2003); Analysis of the Malaysian Toll Road Public Private Partnership Program and Recommendations for Policy Improvements, (2005)","","ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network","","","","","","25869159","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073551609"

The paper examines the different perceptions by the public and private sectors about these concern factors adopted by experienced professionals related to PPP transportation projects. Based on a questionnaire survey in Vietnam, the most concern factors of private investors are their own capacity, demand issues, legal and political risks, long-term income, and financial sources issues of the PPP project. Moreover, five factors that represent the significant differences between the private and public sectors including political risks, enhancement of company's strength in its industry, construction risks, demand issues, and financial viability of the company are also discovered. Addressing the different perceptions is indispensable to ensure the public sector can establish necessary policies that appeal to both domestic and foreign private investors.

When steel is recovered from end-of-life products, some materials containing tramp elements besides carbon steel are mixed into the scrap. Therefore, we must prevent contamination by tramp elements during repeated recycling. Meanwhile, there is little knowledge on tramp element contents in carbon steel. This study aims to quantify tramp element contents in carbon steel produced in Japan. The tramp element contents of more than 500 samples of carbon steel were analyzed. The specimens were classified by steel product forms because the tolerance for tramp element contents differs by form. The average contents and confidence intervals for populations were calculated and then multiplied by the annual carbon steel production in Japan. The amounts of Ni and Mo impurities associated with carbon steel produced annually accounted for more than 15% of the annual consumption of these metals in Japan. In addition, the consumptions for plating were considered. The results were confirmed by a comparison with the contents in carbon steel produced from steel scrap generated in Japan after non-ferrous metals were separated from the scrap, which was performed in Vietnam. It is hypothesized that the tramp element contents in the Vietnamese steel are equal to the weighted average contents of carbon steels consumed in Japan. The comparison for Cu and Sn showed good agreement. We conclude that tramp element contents in carbon steel obtained in this study are representative values, even though the number of samples was limited. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Elemental analysis; Impurity; Non-functional recycling; Repeated recycling; Steel scrap","Carbon steel; Chemical analysis; Impurities; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Steel metallurgy; Steelmaking; Annual consumption; Confidence interval; End-of-life products; Non-functional; Number of samples; Recyclable material; Representative values; Weighted averages; Steel scrap","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15H02860 and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (1-1402) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.

Simulations incorporate different land use/cover and anthropogenic heat release data sets for the current and future periods, while the boundary condition was fixed in the current time to detect only the impact of urbanization. Furthermore, human thermal comfort due to changes in the thermal environment was examined by analyzing the temperature-humidity index. Simulated results show that the increase in the surface air temperature is approximately 0.22 °C in the preexisting urbanized area and approximately 0.41 °C in new highly urbanized areas. The main factor in these changes is conversion from agricultural or grassland to urban structures, which results in increased sensible heating and decreased latent heating. Simulated results also show that despite the increase in air temperature, there is no significant change in thermal comfort. This is because human comfort is not only determined by temperature alone, but also by relative humidity. Urbanization increases temperatures, but decreases evaporation, which then decreases the relative humidity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamical downscaling; Future urbanization; Greater Ho Chi Minh City; Human thermal comfort; Tropical developing megacity; Weather research and forecasting model","","","","We thank Dr. Vo Le Phu and Dr. Tran Thi Van for their useful help in collecting the data.

Previous measurements of the condensation rate were mainly based on the optical visualization. In the paper, the development of a new method that uses two ultrasonic frequencies for the measurement of the condensation rate in subcooled boiling is presented. The ultrasonic velocity profile (UVP) method is used for the velocity measurement. Two simultaneous UVP measurements by the two frequencies are exploited. The principle of the new condensation-rate-measurement method is established. In the method, the UVP data of the bubble surface velocity are used. In subcooled boiling, the bubble-surface velocity is affected by the condensation. The UVP measurement must capture correctly the condensation effect on the bubble-surface velocity. In order to confirm the applicability of the UVP method to the measurement of the surface velocity in this case, the growth rate of air bubbles from a nozzle submerged in water is measured and compared with the result of optical visualization and digital image processing. Such growth process is analogous to that of vapor bubbles in a boiling process, and it is the inverse of the condensation process. Evaluation of the new condensation-rate-measurement method is carried out by the measurements of adiabatic air-water-bubbly column and subcooled pool boiling in vertical round tube. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Condensation rate; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Optical visualization; Subcooled boiling; Ultrasonic velocity profile measurement","Air; Heat transfer; Image processing; Inverse problems; Mass transfer; Optical data processing; Ultrasonic velocity; Ultrasonic velocity measurement; Ultrasonic waves; Velocity; Visualization; Condensation effects; Condensation process; Condensation rates; Heat and mass transfer; Optical visualization; Sub-cooled boiling; Ultrasonic frequency; Ultrasonic velocity profiles; Condensation","","","The first author would like to express his sincere thanks to Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( JSPS ) for financial support, in the JSPS Ronpaku PhD Program, to carry out this study in the Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors, Tokyo Institute of Technology .

The storm surge manifested itself on the 8th November 2013 as Haiyan made landfall, devastating large areas in the islands of Leyte and Samar. To attempt to gain an understanding of the level of awareness that local residents had about storm surges the authors conducted structured questionnaires (n = 172) and focus group interviews with local residents, and discussed the results obtained with key informants (government officers and disaster risk managers). One of the key problems identified during the interviews was how people were not able to clearly understand the concept of a storm surge, with many respondents emphasizing how it would have been better for authorities to describe it as a ""tsunami"". A discussion is also made on the recent evolution in world-wide coastal disaster awareness, comparing it to recent developments in storm surge awareness in the Philippines and other countries in the area, such as Vietnam and Japan. The authors conclude that, in terms of its influence on world-wide disaster awareness, typhoon Haiyan constitutes an event of similar importance to major recent high-impact tsunami events such as the 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 Tohoku events. As a result, the authors will outline a number of lessons learnt from Haiyan, such as the necessity for creating multi-layer safety strategies and improving how information about storm surges is transmitted to local residents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","awareness; evacuation preparations; preparedness; resilience; Typhoon Yolanda","Disasters; Hurricanes; Storms; Surveys; Tsunamis; awareness; Coastal disasters; Comparative analysis; Evacuation preparation; Local residents; preparedness; resilience; Safety strategy; Floods","","","Funding text 1: Finally, funds for the field survey were mainly provided by the Strategic Research Foundation Grant-aided Project for Private Universities from the Ministry of Education (Waseda University), and partly by the Global Programme on Sustainability Science Global Leadership Initiative (GPSS-GLI, The University of Tokyo) and J-RAPID Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) (Tokyo Institute of Technology).; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of several Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Office of Civil Defence (OCD), Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical & Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and other Philippines disaster management officials, who provided invaluable information for the elaboration of this manuscript.

We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height on more than 18.6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.5–22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3– 19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8– 144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; article; female; Guatemala; human; human experiment; Iranian people; longevity; major clinical study; male; Netherlands; South Asia; South Korean; tertiary education","","","Funding text 1: Cancer, France)*; Nahla Hwalla (American University of Beirut, Lebanon)*; Licia Iacoviello (IRCCS Isti-tuto Neurologico Mediterraneo Neuromed, Italy)*; Anna G Iannone (Cardiologia di Mercato S.

Although these water jars are important breeding sites for mosquitoes, Vietnam legislation prohibits the use of chemical larvicides in such containers. The effect of Olyset Net on the abundance of mosquito larvae and their Heteroptera predators (Micronecta spp. and Veliidae) in jars was evaluated via field experiments conducted in Tan Chanh, Long An, Vietnam. The number of Aedes larvae decreased when the jars were covered with the Olyset Net, while the numbers of non-Aedes mosquito larvae (Culex and Anopheles), and those of Micronecta and Veliidae, did not vary until the end of the experiment. However, Micronecta population increased after removing the Olyset Net from the jars, and consequently Aedes larvae decreased due to these changes in the Micronecta, 26 days after the Olyset Net was removed. Incomplete use of Olyset Net failed to control mosquitoes in water jars based on the invasion of adult mosquitoes, and in water transferred by residents among the jars, which might contain larvae. These results suggest that Micronecta, as well as Olyset Net, can be considered as control agents for mosquito larvae. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; Aedes; Article; breeding; Heteroptera; larva; mosquito; nonhuman; olyset net; protective equipment; Viet Nam; water contamination; animal; Anopheles; biological control agent; Culex; growth, development and aging; human; insecticide treated net; mosquito control; parasitology; physiology; population dynamics; procedures; statistics and numerical data; water supply; insecticide; permethrin; water; Animals; Biological Control Agents; Humans; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Insecticides; Larva; Mosquito Control; Permethrin; Population Dynamics; Water; Water Supply","","permethrin, 51877-74-8, 52645-53-1; water, 7732-18-5; Biological Control Agents; Insecticides; Permethrin; Water","We would like to thank T.

At dusk sector (Indian longitudes), a rapid uplift of equatorial F layer to >550 km and development of intense equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) were observed. These EPBs were found to extend up to 27.13°N and 25.98°S magnetic dip latitudes indicating their altitude development to ~1670 km at apex. In contrast, at few degrees east in the premidnight sector (Thailand-Indonesian longitudes), no significant height rise and/or EPB activity has been observed. The eastward electric field perturbations due to PPEF are greatly dominated at dusk sector despite the existence of background westward ionospheric disturbance dynamo (IDD) fields, whereas they were mostly counter balanced by the IDD fields in the premidnight sector. In situ observations from SWARM-A and SWARM-C and Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System satellites detected a large plasma density depletion near Indian equatorial region due to large electrodynamic uplift of F layer to higher than satellite altitudes. Further, this large uplift is found to confine to a narrow longitudinal sector centered on sunset terminator. This study brings out the significantly enhanced equatorial zonal electric field in response to PPEF that is uniquely confined to dusk sector. The responsible mechanisms are discussed in terms of unique electrodynamic conditions prevailing at dusk sector in the presence of convection electric fields associated with the onset of a substorm under southward interplanetary magnetic field B<inf>z</inf>. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","equatorial zonal electric field; geomagnetic storms; prompt penetration","","","","This work is supported by STEL, Nagoya University under the international joint research program 2015 and partially supported by DST, Government of India through project GITA/DST/TWN/P-47/ 2013.

We find genetic variants at 12 new loci to be associated with blood pressure (P = 3.9 × 10 -11 to 5.0 × 10 -21). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 new loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7 and TBX2) function. The new and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.04 to 8.6 × 10 -6). Our results provide new evidence for the role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","ARHGAP24 gene; Article; blood pressure regulation; CpG island; diastolic blood pressure; DNA methylation; East Asian; European; gene; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; heart left ventricle mass; human; human experiment; IGFBP3 gene; KCNK3 gene; mortality; normal human; OSR1 gene; PDE3A gene; phenotype; PRDM6 gene; priority journal; replication study; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC22A7 gene; South Asian; systolic blood pressure; TBX2 gene; vascular smooth muscle; adult; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; Caucasian; ethnology; female; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; male; middle aged; procedures; regression analysis; risk factor; very elderly; brain natriuretic peptide; peptide fragment; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; DNA Methylation; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors","","brain natriuretic peptide, 114471-18-0; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76)","Funding text 1: Biobank staff for biomedical data collection and preparation.

In Southeast Asia, mosquitoes of the Anopheles leucosphyrus group bite both humans and monkeys in the forest and thus offer a possible route for Plasmodium species to bridge the species barrier. In this study we analysed the species composition of malarial sporozoites infecting the salivary glands of Anopheles dirus in order to determine their potential role as bridge vectors of Plasmodium parasites from monkeys to humans. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected in the forest and forest fringe area of Khanh Phu commune by human-baited landing collection. Anopheles species were determined on the basis of morphologic features. Sporozoite-infected salivary glands were applied to filter paper and dried in an ambient atmosphere, before storage in closed vials at 4-6 °C. Detection and identification of Plasmodium species in salivary glands were carried out by nested-PCR of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Results: Six species of Plasmodium parasites were detected by PCR, of which P. vivax was the most common, followed by P. knowlesi, P. inui, P. cynomolgi, P. coatneyi and P. falciparum. Twenty-six of the 79 sporozoite infected mosquitoes showed multiple infections, most of which were a combination of P. vivax with one or more of the non-human primate Plasmodium species. Conclusions: These results suggest that humans overnighting in this forest are frequently inoculated with both human and non-human primate malaria parasites, leading to a situation conducive for the emergence of novel zoonotic malaria. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anopheles dirus; Plasmodium coatneyi; Plasmodium cynomolgi; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium inui; Plasmodium knowlesi; Plasmodium vivax; Sporozoites","adult; Anopheles; Anopheles dirus; Article; controlled study; exposure; human; inoculation; malaria; male; mosquito bite; nonhuman; parasite identification; parasite vector; Plasmodium; Plasmodium cynomolgi; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium knowlesi; Plasmodium vivax; polymerase chain reaction; primate; species composition; sporozoite; Viet Nam; animal; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; female; genetics; insect vector; isolation and purification; nucleotide sequence; parasitology; physiology; salivary gland; transmission; leucosphyrus group; Plasmodium coatneyi; Plasmodium inui; Plasmodium parasites; Primates; protozoal DNA; ribosome RNA; RNA 18S; Animals; Base Sequence; DNA, Protozoan; Female; Humans; Insect Vectors; Malaria; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Salivary Glands; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Vietnam","","DNA, Protozoan; RNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S","We thank Nguyen Son Hai, Phan Chau Do, Dang Duy Vu and Nguyen Le Dung for their technical support.

However, changes in genotype distribution over time were poorly understood, particularly in developing countries. We therefore conducted a molecular epidemiological study which characterized the norovirus strains detected in 4437 Nepalese children with acute diarrhea between November 2005 and January 2011 to gain insight into how their genotypes changed over time. Of the 356 samples positive for noroviruses, 277 (78%) were successfully genotyped into 22 capsid genotypes; GII.4 (. n=. 113), GII.3 (. n=. 38) and GII.13 (. n=. 37) were the majority. Interestingly, GII.13 accounted for only 1.7% (4/230) between 2005 and 2008 (period 1) but increased substantially to 26.2% (33/126) between 2009 and 2011 (period 2). Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 nucleotide sequences of 35 GII.13 strains indicated that they clustered into two lineages named NPL2008 and NPL2009 to which two period 1 strains and 33 period 2 strains belonged, respectively. Lineage NPL2009 contained GII.13 strains that were detected in a large-scale gastroenteritis outbreak in Germany in 2012. Both Nepalese and German VP1 sequences carried two substitutions, H378N and V394Q, in the putative histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-binding sites. As to the polymerase genotypes of Nepalese strains, the period 1 strains possessed GII.Pm, but the period 2 strains possessed GII.P13, GII.P16, and GII.P21. Together with recent reports on the predominance of GII.P13/GII.13 and GII.P16/GII.13 in India and GII.P16/GII.13 in European countries, this study predicts that genotype GII.13 which was previously regarded as a minor genotype has a potential to become an epidemiologically important genotype. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gastroenteritis; GII.13; GII.P16/GII.13; Histo-blood group antigen; Norovirus; Recombination","protein VP1; blood group antigen; capsid protein; acute diarrhea; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; Article; binding site; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; genetic distance; genetic recombination; genotype; human; major clinical study; molecular epidemiology; Nepalese; nonhuman; Norovirus; norovirus infection; nucleotide sequence; observational study; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; preschool child; prevalence; RNA processing; virus detection; Caliciviridae Infections; chemistry; classification; diarrhea; genetics; infant; molecular genetics; Nepal; newborn; sequence alignment; virology; Miridae; Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Blood Group Antigens; Capsid Proteins; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diarrhea; Genotype; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Molecular Epidemiology; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment","","protein VP1, 92354-95-5; Blood Group Antigens; Capsid Proteins","Funding text 1: This study was supported in part by grants-in-aid for general scientific research by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences ( 16406016 and 20406013 awarded to O.N.), the grants in-aid for scientific research from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan, a Grant from Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases , and a Global Center of Excellence Program , entitled Integrated Global strategy for the Control of Tropical and Emerging Infectious Diseases, awarded to Nagasaki University.; Funding text 2: Thi Nguyen Hoa-Tran was a Ph.D. student supported by a scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan .

Hence, although ecological studies of rice agroecosystems in northern Vietnam are necessary, very few integrated studies of breeding habitats of mosquitoes, including JE vectors, have been conducted. We carried out a field study and investigated the mosquito fauna in six rice production areas in northern Vietnam during the rainy and dry seasons of 2009. Mosquitoes and potential mosquito predators were collected from aquatic habitats by using larval dippers. We collected 1780 Culex individuals (including 254 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus; 113 Cx. vishnui, 58 Cx. vishnui complex, consisting of Cx. vishnui and Cx. pseudovishnui; 12 Cx. gelidus; 1 Cx. bitaeniorhynchus; and 1 Cx. fuscocephala), 148 Anopheles individuals (including 5 An. vagus), 1 Mansonia annulifera, and 1 Mimomyia chamberlaini during the rainy season. During the dry season, we collected 176 Culex individuals (including 33 Cx. vishnui, 24 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, 8 Cx. vishnui complex, and 1 Cx. gelidus) and 186 Anopheles individuals (including 9 An. tessellatus, 2 An. kochi, and 2 An. barbumbrosus). We found mosquitoes in all aquatic habitats, namely, rice fields, ditches, ponds, wetlands, irrigation canals, and rice nurseries, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui complex were found in all the above six areas. Heteroptera such as Micronecta, Veliidae, and Pleidae were abundant and widely distributed in both the seasons. The abundance of mosquito larvae was higher in the rice fields, ditches, and ponds during the rainy season than during the dry season. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui complex, Cx. fuscocephala, and Cx. gelidus were abundant in rice agroecosystems (rice fields, ditches, ponds, and wetlands) in northern Vietnam, and their abundance was high during the rainy season. These findings deepen our understanding of mosquito ecology and strengthen mosquito control strategies to be applied in rice ecosystems Vietnam in the future. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Culex vishnui subgroup; Integrated vector management; Mosquito control","abundance; agricultural ecosystem; aquatic environment; fauna; mosquito; paddy field; parasite control; population distribution; seasonal variation; adult; agroecosystem; Anopheles; aquatic fauna; arthropod larva; Article; controlled study; Culex; ditch; environmental factor; field study; geographic distribution; Heteroptera; irrigation canal; Mansonia annulifera; Micronecta; Mimomyia chamberlaini; nonhuman; Pleidae; pond; population abundance; predator; rice field; rice nursery; vector control; Veliidae; Viet Nam; wetland; animal; crop; disease carrier; ecosystem; human; Japanese encephalitis; larva; Oryza; parasitology; physiology; season; Hanoi; Culex vishnui; rain; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Encephalitis, Japanese; Humans; Insect Vectors; Larva; Mosquito Control; Rain; Seasons; Vietnam; Wetlands","","","We thank the entomological staff of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.

Data were collected from 1118 respondents in Japan, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The dependent variable was the intention to use one of three modes for work travel after getting a job: car, public transit, or other modes. The explanatory variables were three attitude factors taken from a previous study, including: 1/symbolic affective, reflecting affective motives of travel mode use; 2/instrumental, referring to functional attributes of travel modes; and 3/social orderliness which represents for environmental friendliness, safety, altruism, quietness et cetera. Several logit model estimates were made using the samples from the six countries separately and together. We obtained three main findings. First, attitude variables about the car were all significant determinants for the entire sample from Asian countries. Second, the social orderliness aspect of public transit was a common concern of respondents from developing countries in selecting this mode for work trips. Third, in countries in which the intent to use a car was not very high, attitude factors about the car were found to be significant determinants of the behavioral intention to commute by car but were less significant in countries in which the desire to use a car was high. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitudes toward travel modes; Commuting mode choice; Mobility management; Psychological methods","Developing countries; Logistic regression; Commuting modes; Environmental friendliness; Explanatory variables; Mobility management; Psychological factors; Psychological methods; Public transportation; Travel modes; Urban transportation; altruism; car use; commuting; developing world; logit analysis; psychology; public transport; transportation safety; transportation system; travel behavior; China; Indonesia; Japan; Philippines; Thailand; Viet Nam","","","The survey in this study was supported by the research group for the “Applicability of Ecological Transportation Systems in Developing Countries” of the International Association of Traffic and Safety Science.

Among dengue patients with shock, approximately 30% have recurrent shock that requires a treatment change. Here, we report development of a clinical rule for use during a patient's first shock episode to predict a recurrent shock episode.Methods: The study was conducted in Center for Preventive Medicine in Vinh Long province and the Children's Hospital No. 2 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We included 444 dengue patients with shock, 126 of whom had recurrent shock (28%). Univariate and multivariate analyses and a preprocessing method were used to evaluate and select 14 clinical and laboratory signs recorded at shock onset. Five variables (admission day, purpura/ecchymosis, ascites/pleural effusion, blood platelet count and pulse pressure) were finally trained and validated by a 10-fold validation strategy with 10 times of repetition, using a logistic regression model.Results: The results showed that shorter admission day (fewer days prior to admission), purpura/ecchymosis, ascites/pleural effusion, low platelet count and narrow pulse pressure were independently associated with recurrent shock. Our logistic prediction model was capable of predicting recurrent shock when compared to the null method (P < 0.05) and was not outperformed by other prediction models. Our final scoring rule provided relatively good accuracy (AUC, 0.73; sensitivity and specificity, 68%). Score points derived from the logistic prediction model revealed identical accuracy with AUCs at 0.73. Using a cutoff value greater than -154.5, our simple scoring rule showed a sensitivity of 68.3% and a specificity of 68.2%.Conclusions: Our simple clinical rule is not to replace clinical judgment, but to help clinicians predict recurrent shock during a patient's first dengue shock episode. © 2013 Huy et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","ascites; complication; decision support system; dengue; ecchymosis; hospitalization; human; Pleural Effusion; pulse rate; purpura; recurrent disease; shock; statistical model; thrombocyte count; time; Ascites; Decision Support Techniques; Dengue; Ecchymosis; Hospitalization; Humans; Logistic Models; Platelet Count; Pulse; Purpura; Recurrence; Shock; Time Factors","","","We thank all the members of the Laboratory of Arbovirus, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

All metal concentrations in 0-10-cm water samples, except Mn, were lower than the maximum permitted concentration for irrigation water standard. Meanwhile, concentrations of As, Cd, and Zn in 0-30-cm sediments were likely to have adverse effects on agriculture and aquatic life. Sediment pollution assessment was undertaken using enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index (I <inf>geo</inf>). The I <inf>geo</inf> results indicated that the sediment was not polluted with Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni, and the pollution level increased in the order of Cu < Pb < Zn < As < Cd. Meanwhile, significant enrichment was shown for Cd, As, Zn, and Pb. Cluster and principal component analyses suggest that As and Mn in sediment were derived from both lithogenic and anthropogenic sources, while Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd, and Ni originated from anthropogenic sources such as vehicular fumes for Pb and metallic discharge from industrial sources and fertilizer application for other metals. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Geochemical indices; Hanoi; Metals; Multivariate statistical approaches; Sediment","Anthropogenic sources; Fertilizer applications; Geo-accumulation index; Geochemical indices; Hanoi; Industrial sources; Multivariate statistical approaches; Source discrimination; Cadmium; Cadmium compounds; Copper; Irrigation; Lead; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Manganese removal (water treatment); Metals; Multivariant analysis; Nickel; Pollution; Principal component analysis; Sediments; Water supply; Zinc; River pollution; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; copper; fertilizer; heavy metal; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; river water; zinc; concentration (composition); enrichment; environmental impact assessment; geoaccumulation index; hydrochemistry; multivariate analysis; pollutant source; sediment chemistry; sediment pollution; water pollution; aquatic environment; article; bioaccumulation; cluster analysis; concentration (parameters); environmental enrichment; exhaust gas; industrial waste; irrigation (agriculture); principal component analysis; sediment; urban area; Viet Nam; water contamination; water sampling; water standard; Agriculture; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Metals, Heavy; Principal Component Analysis; Rivers; Vietnam; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; Lich River","","arsenic, 7440-38-2; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; chromium, 14092-98-9, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nickel, 7440-02-0; zinc, 14378-32-6, 7440-66-6; Metals, Heavy, 0; Water Pollutants, Chemical, 0","Acknowledgments Comments from the anonymous reviewers are gratefully acknowledged.

In order to estimate overall associations between human genetic variants, HLA antigens, HLA alleles and PSHD, we systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies in both post-schistosomal hepatic disorder and post-schistosomal non-hepatic disorder patients. PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, The HuGE Published Literature database, Cochrane Library, and manual search of reference lists of articles published before July 2009 were used to retrieve relevant studies. Two reviewers independently selected articles and extracted data on study characteristics and data regarding the association between genetic variants, HLA antigens, HLA alleles and PSHD in the form of 2 × 2 tables. A meta-analysis using fixed-effects or random-effects models to pooled odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated only if more than one study had investigated particular variation. We found 17 articles that met our eligibility criteria. Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum were reported as the species causing PSHD. Since human genetic variants were only investigated in one study, these markers were not assessed by meta-analysis. Thus, only HLA-genes (a total of 66 HLA markers) were conducted in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that human leucocyte antigens HLA-DQB1*0201 (OR = 2.64, P= 0.018), DQB1*0303 (OR = 1.93, P= 0.008), and DRB1*0901 (OR = 2.14, P= 0.002) alleles and HLA-A1 (OR = 5.10, P= 0.001), A2 (OR = 2.17, P= 0.005), B5 (OR = 4.63, P= 0.001), B8 (OR = 2.99, P= 0.02), and B12 (OR = 5.49, P= 0.005) serotypes enhanced susceptibility to PSHD, whereas HLA-DQA1*0501 (OR = 0.29, P≤ 0.001) and DQB1*0301 (OR = 0.58, P= 0.007) were protective factors against the disease. We further suggested that the DRB1*0901-DQB1*0201, DRB1*0901-DQB1*0303 and A1-B8 haplotypes enhanced susceptibility to PSHD, whereas DQA1*0501-DQB1*0301 linkage decreased the risk of PSHD. The result improved our understanding of the association between the HLA loci and PSHD with regard to pathogenic or protective T-cells and provided novel evidence that HLA alleles may influence disease severity. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Genetic; Hepatic disorder; HLA; Meta-analysis; Schistosomiasis","HLA antigen; article; disease severity; genetic association; genetic marker; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; human; liver disease; nonhuman; priority journal; Schistosoma japonicum; Schistosoma mansoni; schistosomiasis; serotype; Africa; Alleles; Animals; Asia; Databases, Bibliographic; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Haplotypes; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Humans; Liver Diseases; Odds Ratio; Schistosomiasis; Severity of Illness Index; South America; Scopus","","Histocompatibility Antigens Class I, 0; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II, 0","This work was also supported in part by a Grand-in-Aid for Young Scientists ( 17301870 , 2008–2010 for NTH) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT, Japan) , and was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Nagasaki University to NTH (2007–2009).

Muconaldehyde was not produced from phenol, indicating that muconaldehyde and phenol are produced as initial stable intermediates by independent pathways. The amount of muconaldehyde produced in the reaction solution was low because it was rapidly oxidized on the photocatalyst. The contributions of the two pathways to the mineralization of benzene were analyzed by isotopic tracing methods using labeled benzene (13C<inf>6</inf>H<inf>6</inf>) and labeled phenol (13C<inf>6</inf>H<inf>5</inf>OH). The results showed that a larger part (60-70%) of benzene is initially converted to muconaldehyde. The percentage was dependent on the properties of TiO<inf>2</inf> powders.

The utility of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate assay for this purpose has been debated and is not yet routinely clinically performed. To adequately evaluate this assay, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of the CSF lactate concentration as a marker for both bacterial meningitis and aseptic meningitis was performed.Methods: Electronic searches in PubMed, Scopus, the MEDION database and the Cochrane Library were conducted to identify relevant articles published before March 2009. A manual search of reference lists from selected articles was also conducted. Two reviewers independently selected relevant articles and extracted data on study characteristics, quality and accuracy.Results: Twenty-five articles were identified that met the eligibility criteria. Diagnostic odds ratios were considerably homogenous (Chi-square P = 0.1009, I2 = 27.6%), and the homogeneity was further confirmed by a Galbraith plot and meta-regression analysis using several covariates. The symmetrical summary receiver-operator characteristic curve (SROC), fitted using the Moses-Shapiro-Littenberg method, was positioned near the upper left corner of the SROC curve. The Q value and area under the curve were 0.9451 and 0.9840, respectively, indicating excellent accuracy. The diagnostic accuracy of the CSF lactate concentration was higher than those of other four conventional markers (CSF glucose, CSF/plasma glucose quotient, CSF protein, and CSF total number of leukocytes) using a head to head meta-analysis of the 25 included studies.Conclusions: To distinguish bacterial meningitis from aseptic meningitis, CSF lactate is a good single indicator and a better marker compared to other conventional markers. © 2010 Huy et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","glucose; lactic acid; biological marker; area under the curve; article; aseptic meningitis; bacterial meningitis; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; cerebrospinal fluid glucose level; cerebrospinal fluid lactate level; cerebrospinal fluid level; Cochrane Library; concentration (parameters); diagnostic accuracy; disease marker; glucose blood level; human; leukocyte count; Medline; meta analysis; priority journal; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; receiver operating characteristic; regression analysis; systematic review; animal; cerebrospinal fluid; comparative study; differential diagnosis; review; Animals; Biological Markers; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Lactic Acid; Meningitis, Aseptic; Meningitis, Bacterial","","glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; lactic acid, 113-21-3, 50-21-5; Biological Markers, 0; Lactic Acid, 50-21-5","This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (17301870, 2008-2010 for NTH) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT, Japan), and was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Nagasaki University to NTH (2007-2009).

During the last decade, Southeast Asian countries have been very successful in reducing the burden of malaria. However, malaria remains endemic in these countries, especially in remote and forested areas. The Leucosphyrus group of the genus Anopheles harbors the most important malaria vectors in forested areas of Southeast Asia. In Vietnam, previous molecular studies have resulted in the identification of only Anopheles dirus sensu stricto (previously known as An. dirus species A) among the Leucosphyrus group members. However, Vietnamese entomologists have recognized that mosquitoes belonging to the Leucosphyrus group in northern Vietnam exhibit morphological characteristics similar to those of Anopheles takasagoensis, which has been reported only from Taiwan. Here, we aimed to confirm the genetic and morphological identities of the members of the Leucosphyrus group in Vietnam. Results. In the molecular phylogenetic trees reconstructed using partial COI and ND6 mitochondrial gene sequences, samples collected from southern and central Vietnam clustered together with GenBank sequences of An. dirus that were obtained from Thailand. However, samples from northern Vietnam formed a distinct clade separated from both An. dirus and An. takasagoensis by other valid species. Conclusions. The results suggest the existence of a cryptic species in northern Vietnam that is morphologically similar to, but phylogenetically distant from both An. dirus and An. takasagoensis. We have tentatively designated this possible cryptic species as Anopheles aff. takasagoensis for convenience, until a valid name is assigned. However, it is difficult to distinguish the species solely on the basis of morphological characteristics. Further studies on such as karyotypes and polytene chromosome banding patterns are necessary to confirm whether An. aff. takasagoensis is a valid species. Moreover, studies on (1) the geographic distribution, which is potentially spreading along the Vietnam, China, Laos, and Myanmar borders; (2) morphological and ecological characteristics; and (3) vectorial capacity of this newly identified cryptic species of An. dirus, which is one of the most important malaria vectors in the mainland of Southeast Asia, are necessary for planning efficient malaria vector control programs in this region. © 2010 Takano et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","cytochrome c oxidase; mitochondrial DNA; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; Anopheles; anopheles dirus; Anopheles takasagoensis; article; disease carrier; DNA sequence; fly; forest; genetic identification; leucosphyrus; malaria; mitochondrial gene; molecular phylogeny; morphological trait; mosquito; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; sampling; species difference; Viet Nam; Anopheles dirus; Culicidae; Diptera; leucosphyrus group","GENBANK: AB518499, AB518500, AB518501, AB518502, AB518503, AB518504, AB518505, AB518506, AB518507, AB518508, AB518509, AB518510, AB518511, AB518512, AB518513, AB518514, AB518515, AB518516, AB518517, AB518518, AB518519, AB518520, AB518521, AB518522, AB518523, AB518524, AB518525, AB518526, AB518527, AB518528, AB518529, AB518530, AB518531, AB518532, AB518533, AB518534, AB518535, AB518536, AB518537, AB518538, AB518539, AB518540, AB518541, AB518542, AB518543, AB518544, AB518545, AB518546, AB518547, AB518548, AB518549, AB518550, AB518551, AB518552, AB518553, AB518554, AB518555, AB518556, AB518557, AB518558, AB518559, AB518560, AB518561, AB518562, AB518563, AB518564, AB518565, AB518566, AB518567, AB518568, AB518569, AB518570, AB518571, AB518572, AB518573, AB518574, AB518575, AB518576, AB518577, AB518578, AF417695, AF417697, DQ897936, DQ897937, DQ897938, DQ897939, DQ897940, DQ897941, DQ897942, DQ897943, DQ897944, DQ897945, DQ897946, DQ897947, DQ897948, DQ897949, DQ897950, DQ897951, DQ897952, DQ897953, DQ897954, DQ897955, DQ897956, DQ897957, DQ897958, DQ897959, DQ897960, DQ897961, DQ897962, DQ897963, DQ897964, DQ897965, DQ897966, DQ897967, DQ897968, DQ897969, DQ897970, DQ897971, DQ897972, DQ899796, DQ899797, DQ899798, DQ899799, DQ899800, DQ899801, DQ899802, DQ899803, DQ899804, DQ899805, DQ899806, DQ899807, DQ899808, DQ899809, DQ899810, DQ899811, DQ899812, DQ899813, DQ899814, DQ899815, DQ899816, DQ899817, DQ899818, DQ899819, DQ899820, DQ899821, DQ899822, DQ899823, DQ899824, DQ899825, DQ899826, DQ899827, DQ899828, DQ899829, DQ899830, DQ899831, DQ899832, L20934, NC_000875, U35259, U35260","cytochrome c oxidase, 72841-18-0, 9001-16-5; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase, 9027-14-9, 9032-21-7, 9079-67-8","We thank members of the Bắc Kạ n Provincial Malaria Center, Commune Health Center, and the Department of Molecular Biology of NIMPE, and TSUZUKI Ataru for help in the field collection in Bắc Kạ n Province, Vietnam; Ho Dinh TRUNG, Le Xuan HOI, Vu Dinh CHU, Vu Duc CHINH and other members of the Department of Entomology, NIMPE for providing Anopheles samples; SAWABE Kyoko and KOMAGATA Osamu for their advice on DNA extraction; and SIBATA Hiroki, and OKUDA Naoko for their help and guidance in DNA sequencing.

It was found that the yield of methyl esters strongly depended on the amount of KOH and the molar ratio of methanol to triolein (M/T) and was highest at the M/T molar ratio of 6/1, KOH concentration of 1 wt% and irradiation time of 30 min. In addition, the effects of sonication on the methanolysis of triolein were discussed in comparison to the effects of stirring experiments. The optimum condition under stirring experiments showed that the molar ratio of M/T, KOH concentration and reaction time were 6/1, 1.5 wt% and 4 h, respectively. These results clearly indicated that the ultrasonic irradiation method would be a promising one compared to the conventional stirring method. The high yield under the ultrasonic irradiation condition would be due to high speed mixing and mass transfer between the methanol and triolein as well as the formation of a microemulsion resulting from the ultrasonic cavitation phenomenon. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The solubility of the homo-polymers in organic solvents decreased in the order of P3HCA > PDHCA > P4HCA > PMHCA. The wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) results indicated that P4HCA or PMHCA with p-OH group had higher crystallinity, in contrast to P3HCA or PDHCA with m-OH group which had lower crystallinity. Crossed-polarizing microscopy suggested that P4HCA had the nematic liquid crystal properties at 220°C and PDHCA showed birefringence properties at 200°C. In cell-adhesion tests, PDHCA showed the highest cell adhesion (ca. 70%), whereas P3HCA, P4HCA and PMHCA had 50, 18 and 10% cell adhesion, respectively.

We generated a SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus (RVV-S) using highly attenuated strain LC16m8. Intradermal administration of RVV-S into rabbits induced neutralizing (NT) antibodies against SARS-CoV 1 week after administration and the NT titer reached 1:1000 after boost immunization with RVV-S. Significantly, NT antibodies against SARS-CoV were induced by administration of RVV-S to rabbits that had been pre-immunized with LC16m8. RVV-S can induce NT antibodies against SARS-CoV despite the presence of NT antibodies against VV. These results suggest that RVV-S may be a powerful SARS vaccine, including in patients previously immunized with the smallpox vaccine. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Least-clouded day- and night-scenes of TERRA/ MODIS acquired between 2001 and 2003 were selected to generate land-surface temperature (LST) maps. Spatial patterns of UHIs for each city were examined over its diurnal cycle and seasonal variations. A Gaussian approximation was applied in order to quantify spatial extents and magnitude of individual UHIs for inter-city comparison. To reveal relationship of UHIs with surface properties, UHI patterns were analyzed in association with urban vegetation covers and surface energy fluxes derived from high-resolution Landsat ETM+ data. This study provides a generalized picture on the UHI phenomena in the Asian region and the findings can be used to guide further study integrating satellite high-resolution thermal data with land-surface modeling and meso-scale climatic modeling in order to understand impacts of urbanization on local climate in Asia. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Cells in the subapical zone of the hyphal bundle reduced their length by division before arthroconidiation. Approximately 400 000 arthroconidia were produced by a coremium in 1 day, with constant productivity over a 2-week period. Continuous cell extension and division in the coremium stipe supplied cells for arthroconidiation at the coremium apex, which is surrounded by a liquid droplet (coremioliquid). Maintenance of moisture with coremioliquid was necessary for arthroconidiation.

The orthogneiss complex has given some radiogenic dates of Early Proterozoic and Late Archean, which are the oldest ages ever registered for the Southeast Asian continent. Zircon grains separated from three samples of the orthogneiss complex have been dated to establish the protolith age and the timing of high-grade tectonothermal events in the complex. Sixty-five SHRIMP U-Th-Pb analyses of these zircons define three age groups of 2.84-2.91, 2.36, and 1.96 Ga. The age groups correspond to three periods of zircon generation. The oldest ∼2.9 Ga cores indicate a minimum age for the protolith of the orthogneiss complex. Two younger generations (including ∼2.36 Ga outer-cores and ∼1.96 Ga rims) probably grew during later high-grade tectono-metamorphic events, which were previously suggested by K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages of ∼2.0 Ga for synkinematic hornblendes. An early thermal history of the orthogneiss complex has been constrained, including a primary magma-crystallization stage starting at ∼2.9 Ga, followed by two Early Proterozoic (∼2.36 and ∼1.96 Ga) high-grade tectonothermal events. The ca. 2.9 Ga protolith age of the orthogneiss complex documented in this study provides new convincing evidence for the presence of Archean rocks in Indochina, and clearly indicates that the crustal evolution of northern Viet Nam started as early as Late Archean time. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The belt is mainly composed of hornblende gneisses, amphibolite lenses and mica-schists. Five hornblendes from a gneiss and an amphibolite were analyzed chemically and chronologically by Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA) and 40Ar/39Ar methods. EPMA analyses show that hornblendes in the gneiss and the amphibolite have significant amount of edenite component and similar average composition. However, the recalculated Fe3+ content is significantly heterogeneous in a thin section while total Fe is nearly the same among the analyses. The rim of each crystal is higher in Fe3+(Fe3+ + Fe2+) than the core. These chemical and petrological features suggest that the hornblendes have suffered significant oxidation, in particular, largely in the gneiss. 40Ar/39Ar analyses showed that the gneiss has a significant variation of plateau ages (2089±14, 1977±19 and 1873±13 Ma) among three hornblende grains, whereas the amphibolite gives the same plateau ages (2056±14 and 2044±21 Ma) for two grains. All grains of both samples have excess ages in the first few fractions at low temperatures and partial-loss ages between the excess and plateau spectra. The Ca/K ratios indicate some disturbed phases for the lower temperature spectra but the partial-loss ages are also derived from hornblende phase. These facts suggest that hornblende in the gneiss has experienced partial argon loss by oxidation and/or thermally activated argon diffusion process. However, the gneiss and the associated amphibolite have preserved the early Proterozoic tectono-metamorphic event in the hornblende crystals except for their rims, giving new evidence for the early Proterozoic event within the pre-Mesozoic metamorphic belt (northern Vietnam) south of the Red River shear zone in Indochina. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ar-Ar age; Early Proterozoic; Hornblende; Metamorphic rocks; N.
